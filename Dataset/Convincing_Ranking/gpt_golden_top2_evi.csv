Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience.",We should abandon marriage,https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/03/29/everything-i-have-do-tied-man/women-and-qatars-male-guardianship-rules,https://retrospectjournal.com/2022/03/20/alls-unfair-in-marriage-and-divorce/,Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations,1.0,1.0,1.0

Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it.","In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime.",We should abolish capital punishment,https://deathpenalty.procon.org/questions/does-the-death-penalty-deter-crime/,https://research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating_data.shtml,The death penalty irreversible,1.0,1.0,1.0
