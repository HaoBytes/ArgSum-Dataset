The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”","Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s.",We should abandon marriage,https://ourworldindata.org/marriages-and-divorces,https://ourworldindata.org/marriages-and-divorces,Marriages are unstable,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband.","It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience.",We should abandon marriage,https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/03/29/everything-i-have-do-tied-man/women-and-qatars-male-guardianship-rules,https://retrospectjournal.com/2022/03/20/alls-unfair-in-marriage-and-divorce/,Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it.","In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime.",We should abolish capital punishment,https://deathpenalty.procon.org/questions/does-the-death-penalty-deter-crime/,https://research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating_data.shtml,The death penalty irreversible,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address.","This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom.",We should adopt libertarianism,https://wwnorton.com/books/the-price-of-inequality/,https://www.hughlafollette.com/papers/libertar.htm,Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal,-1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0
