Capital punishment can help bring closure for victimsâ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan Peopleâs Revolutionâ¦ Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution.

Many people might believe that while the death penalty isnât ideal, itâs worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people donât think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nationâs executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesnât even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? Itâs disappearing from legal systems around the world, so itâs time for all nations (like the United States) to end it.","Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it.","Nick Petersen, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Miami, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: Social science research does not support the contention that the death penalty deters crime. In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that âavailable studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.â A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion. Citing a number of problems with deterrence research, the council reported that âclaims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgments about capital punishment.","John J. Donohue III, JD, PhD, Professor of Law at Stanford University, stated the following in his Aug. 8, 2015 article Thereâs No Evidence That Death Penalty Is a Deterrent against Crime, available at theconversation.com: There is not the slightest credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the rate of homicide. Whether one compares the similar movements of homicide in Canada and the US when only the latter restored the death penalty, or in American states that have abolished it versus those that retain it, or in Hong Kong and Singapore (the first abolishing the death penalty in the mid-1990s and the second greatly increasing its usage at the same), there is no detectable effect of capital punishment on crime. The best econometric studies reach the same conclusionâ¦ Last year roughly 14,000 murders were committed but only 35 executions took place. Since murderers typically expose themselves to far greater immediate risks, the likelihood is incredibly remote that some small chance of execution many years after committing a crime will influence the behaviour of a sociopathic deviant who would otherwise be willing to kill if his only penalty were life imprisonment. Any criminal who actually thought he would be caught would find the prospect of life without parole to be a monumental penalty. Any criminal who didnât think he would be caught would be untroubled by any sanction.","H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I wonât commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental.

The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldnât do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty wonât be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of societyâs right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the peopleâs representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst.","Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, âThe Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,â available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion.

Butâ¦ the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect.

Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each humanâs requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.

In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer.","Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition.","Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the fatherâs family name.","There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire.","This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size.

It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests â a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role.
