This debate is about the criminalization of assisted suicide, with opponents of the measure arguing that it gives dignity to the person who wishes to commit it, reduces suffering, allows people to choose to end their life, and that the terminally ill would benefit from it. As evidence, organizations such as Dignitas exist to provide assistance to those wanting assisted suicide, and there are legal acts such as the Washington Death with Dignity Act that serve to regulate it. Kevorkian also wrote that a person's mental state is of paramount importance when performing assisted suicides. In addition, campaigns such as Dignity in Dying strive to inform the public, educate legal and healthcare professionals, and lobby politicians to bring about change in the current laws. Finally, qualitative studies throughout the UK found that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide, as those who have witnessed others die are particularly convinced. In addition, legal cases such as the New Mexico Second District Judge ruling or Dutch laws legalizing euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, the use of Advanced Decisions, and the Irish Times poll all contribute to evidence of the need for assisted suicide. Thus, the opponents of criminalizing assisted suicide present strong evidence for why it should not be criminalized."
"
In the debate about whether or not assisted suicide should be a criminal offence, the positive supporters argue that it should. Firstly, assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit, which violates the rights of the individual and their autonomy, as well as allowing for abuse. Additionally, it should not be allowed as many times people can still get better if given the chance, and it violates the doctor's role as a healer. Furthermore, people do not have the right to self-harm or harm others, and those who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. Various cases have been presented to demonstrate this, such as the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that there is no constitutional right to assisted suicide, the case in New York claiming it as a violation of equal protection, and the New Zealand Medical Association’s stance that it is unethical. Ultimately, these arguments demonstrate why assisted suicide should be a criminal offence."

In summary, opponents of the motion 'Homeschooling should be banned' argue that it is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional, religious, ill or disabled students, as it can be personalized to the child's pace or needs, while mainstream schools have a lot of violence or bullying. Furthermore, they believe parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children, as the home is a good learning environment. This is evidenced by Eastern York Schools providing special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services to homeschooled students, and Gallup polls indicating a shift in attitude from opposition to home education in the last two decades, in addition to research indicating that mainstream schools are not meeting SEN requirements. Furthermore, homeschooling is an option for families living in isolated rural locations or travelling abroad, and it gives the child the liberty to explore their own family's culture, and the opportunity to communicate with a wide range of people."
"

Given the topic of 'Homeschooling should be banned', the positive stance is that homeschooling should be banned because it cannot be regulated or standardized, it fails to provide essential social skills, and is not of higher educational quality as mainstream schools. Evidence for these claims include the fact that unschooling does not have a teacher or curriculum, and in Nebraska it allowed families to get away with poor homeschooling; that mainstream schools provide important social experiences that homeschooled children miss out on, such as work experience, sports leagues, and recognition and reward; that a study of more than 700 children showed that those with higher social skills did better in life and had less chance of criminal behaviour; that the European Court of Human Rights upheld the ban in Germany as it is important for children to be exposed to community values and democratic values; and that teachers in mainstream schools are required to have education degrees and can provide a depth and breadth of learning that parents may not be able to provide. These points support the stance that homeschooling should be banned."
"
In the debate on the topic 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', the opponents argue that vaccinations are dangerous (as the CDC reports that the chickenpox vaccine can cause pneumonia and the flu vaccine can be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome) and that their side effects can be serious (e.g. Rotashield was pulled from the market after it was found to be associated with higher instances of intussusception). They also argue that mandatory vaccination violates basic human rights such as the right to freedom of religion and the right to bodily integrity as enshrined in the US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights respectively. Finally, they contend that routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy, as natural infection often provides better immunity than a series of vaccinations, according to Mayo Clinic."
"
The debate topic is 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory.' The positive side argues that it is necessary to make child vaccination mandatory in order to prevent preventable diseases and save lives. Evidence shows that routine vaccinations have been effective at preventing death from serious diseases. For example, since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, there has been a 69% decrease in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age. In the twentieth century, deaths due to polio and smallpox were 16,316 and 29,004 in the United States respectively, but by 2012 each of these diseases had decreased by 99% because of vaccinations. WHO estimates that 3.5 to 5 million deaths are prevented annually by vaccinations and up to 1.5 million children die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination. Furthermore, when the rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur. This high rate of vaccination has been successful in eradicating diseases such as smallpox which had already killed an estimated 300 to 500 million people in the 20th century. Vaccination also helps protect others in the community, which was the focus of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905. Vaccine hesitancy has resulted in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases, making it all the more necessary for child vaccinations to be mandatory."
"
In this debate, the motion is that 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government'. The proponents of this motion argue that government regulation is necessary to ensure effective enforcement of privacy laws, protect freedom of speech, and guard against political abuses of power. On the other hand, the opponents argue that government regulation is ineffective, harms privacy, freedom of speech, and can lead to political abuses by the government. They also believe that government intervention in the affairs of private companies can be inefficient and create excess bureaucracy. To sum up the debate, government regulation of social media platforms is a contentious issue. Supporters argue that it is necessary to protect the public's right to privacy, freedom of expression, and guard against political abuses, while opponents believe it is ineffective, impinges on privacy, freedom of speech, and can lead to political abuses."
"
Topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government' 

Stance: Positive

The government should regulate social media platforms as it can protect the younger audiences, help deal with fake news, and aid in dealing with malicious users. Evidence supports this stance, such as Congress “sought to further First Amendment and e‑commerce interests on the Internet while also promoting the protection of minors”, EPIC and coalition of child advocacy, consumer, and privacy groups filed a complaint urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and penalize TikTok, companies are obligated to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health, the need for an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, transparency from platforms about content moderation decisions, a Gallup poll that found only 37 percent of people believing “news organizations generally get the facts straight”, fake content during the presidential campaign, the Chinese government taking full advantage of social media to release real-time pandemic information, legislation seeking to make social media platforms more transparent, the need to protect users from serious harm, the National Science Foundation to identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms, the Digital Services Act to require companies to more aggressively police their platforms, the dramatic story of the consulting agency Cambridge Analytica exploiting the private information of over 50 million Facebook users, the Pew Trust finding that 13 percent of Americans had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user, and the survey finding that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011."
"
Summarizing the given debate material, it is clear that while the USA is often viewed as a good place to live, there are many concerns that must be addressed. The USA has been found to have unfair health and education policies, a problematic and divisive political system, a negative culture, high taxation and costs of living, inequality and poverty, and safety concerns due to the prevalence of gun violence and racism. Evidence supporting each claim has been presented and includes such findings as white teachers being more likely to give constructive feedback on essays if they believed the student who wrote it was white, a large proportion of Americans reporting difficulty affording health care costs, political divisions between the two parties intensifying, a culture of working ourselves to death, higher prices for prescription drugs and childcare, higher poverty rates for children, the top 10% of households controlling more of the total wealth than in the past, and increased incidents of hate crimes against Asian Americans since the pandemic began. These concerns must be addressed in order for the USA to be considered a good place to live."
"
The debate topic is 'The USA is a good country to live in'. Proponents of this stance are in agreement that the USA has a great economy, health and education systems, environment, democratic rights, culture and people, and offers great opportunities for individuals. Evidence supporting the argument includes statistics about its high per capita income, employment rate, diversity programs and universities, natural resources and wonders, bill of rights and human rights, and a surge in job opportunities. Therefore, it is clear that the USA is an excellent country to live in, with its plethora of advantages."
"
Summary: The debate is about the topic of abandoning the vow of celibacy for priests in the Catholic church. Opponents of the debate argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, is a strong religious belief, makes the priests to be perceived as holy, is a choice made by priests, and religious experiences and traditions should be maintained. They provide evidence to support these claims, such as the writings of Eusebius of Caesarea, Paul VI's encyclical on celibacy, and the Council of Carthage decreeing that bishops, priests, and deacons abstain from conjugal relations. Supporters of the debate argue that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, and provide evidence of this, such as the report released by the church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia and the statement from the Archbishop of Vienna."
"
The topic for debate is 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned'. Supporters of the positive side argue that celibacy is outdated, too pressuring/difficult, unhealthy/unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Evidence presented in support of this argument includes Pope Paul III commuted the celibacy vow to one of conjugal fidelity in 1540; the lack of clear evidence of a general tradition or practice of celibacy before the 4th century; the removal of the requirement of clerical celibacy by Old Catholics in 1874; the contesting of the idea of celibacy from its beginnings; the routine ordination of married men to the priesthood in most Eastern Catholic Churches; records of nuns enduring hardship after the closure of the convent; the difficulty of suppressing urges and lack of someone to share life with; and the claims that celibacy violates Biblical teaching and causes depression. Furthermore, critics have argued that the pressure to remain celibate has led to promiscuity and sexual abuse, and prelate Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck proposed ending celibacy to address the priest shortage. Ultimately, celibacy is an unnatural act in nature, and all living organisms are meant to reproduce."
"
The opponents of the motion, 'We should abandon marriage', argued that marriage benefits children, is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons, makes people happy, makes the couple closer, and provides important financial benefits. Evidence supporting these claims include studies showing that children from homes with married parents did better in every category, showed decreased risks of delinquent behaviors, a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are more likely to attend college, have higher reading scores, and are more likely to receive gender-specific support from having a mother and father. Furthermore, marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Moreover, married people overall do better on virtually every indicator of health and well-being, and married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting. In addition, married people enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships, including their sex lives. Furthermore, marriage provides important financial benefits such as eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits, income splitting, and tax advantages when transferring money and assets."
"
The given debate topic is: 'We should abandon marriage'. This debate topic is supported by several claims and evidence. The first claim is that marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women, and supporting evidence for this claim includes CNN reporting on dowry-related abuse, female genital mutilation as a prerequisite to marriage, expectation that women be submissive to male family members, and that women often face unfair expectations and little reward when they enter a serious relationship. The second claim is that marriages are unstable, and evidence supporting this claim includes personal accounts of marriages not standing the test of time due to financial, parental and other stresses, UN statistics indicating a global increase in divorce rates, and research showing that many couples married before large rises in female employment expectations, leaving them in ill-suited marriages. The third claim is that marriages tie up people with unfair obligations, and supporting evidence for this includes laws requiring women to have male guardian permission to marry and criminal punishments for disobedience. Lastly, the fourth claim is that most of the advantages of marriage can be achieved by a monogamous relationship, and evidence supporting this claim includes the advantages of reduced risk for STDs, emotional intimacy, and having a partner that prioritizes time and personal investment. Overall, this debate suggests that marriage is often harmful and should be abandoned."

Summary:
This debate topic is 'We should abandon the use of school uniform'. Opponents of this topic argue that children can still express themselves using other means, school uniform reduces bullying, school uniforms create a sense of equality and unity, school uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning, and school uniforms saves costs. Evidence supporting the arguments includes examples of students expressing themselves, statistics from the Department of Education which found that uniforms reduce bullying, research on the sense of unity created by school uniforms, and research on how school uniforms save costs for families."
"
Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', this debate affirms that school uniforms are detrimental to students' learning, creativity, self-expression, and individuality. Proponents of this stance present evidence that rules for uniform requirement promote an environment of false beliefs that lack creativity and conformism. This is evidenced by the opinion of Senior Alyse Madsen who said ""Strict dress codes infringe on a student's self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity"" as well as Dr. Alan Hilfer's statement that this situation leads to students resenting uniforms. Furthermore, school uniforms are expensive, often uncomfortable, and sexist as exemplified by 95% of parents believing uniforms are too expensive and a research from the Children's Society finding the average cost of a school uniform is now £340. Moreover, school uniforms are oppressive to individuality as many types of clothes popular among female students are considered to be “sexually suggestive” and restrictive for girls. Additionally, an adolescent's transition into adulthood may be delayed as uniforms fail to equip students with the knowledge of how to make appropriate choices as adults. Ultimately, this debate material affirms that abandoning the use of school uniforms is beneficial to students as it encourages independent thinking, creativity, and self-expression."
"
In this debate, the topic is 'We should abolish capital punishment'. The opponents of this stance argue that the death penalty helps the victim/their family, is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, and prevents crimes. In support of these claims, Governor of South Carolina Henry McMaster pointed out that the death penalty can provide justice and closure for victims' families. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge and US Senator Tom Cotton maintained that capital punishment can help express the moral outrage of society and warn criminals to stop short of murder. Prime Minister Tony Blair opposed the death penalty regardless of the circumstances, while Human Rights Watch condemned them as crimes against humanity. The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights stated that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. Bolte was a proponent of using capital punishment as a deterrent against violent crime and Charles Stimson from the Heritage Foundation argued that the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives - general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. Armstrong Williams argued that the death penalty is necessary to hold murderers accountable and send a message to those considering committing heinous crimes, and David Muhlhausen and Hashem Dezhbakhsh have provided evidence of a deterrent effect of capital punishment."
"
In summary, the debate is about abolishing capital punishment. Supporters of the argument state that state-sanctioned killing is principally wrong, since it is the ultimate, irreversible denial of human rights and carries a high risk of executing an innocent person. They further argue that the death penalty harms the disenfranchised by being a waste of taxpayer funds and not being a deterrent for violent crime, and that it is irreversible since mistakes can never be unmade and it has been proven that states without the death penalty have lower murder rates."
"
In summary, it is proposed that we should abolish intellectual property rights. Opponents of this idea argue that intellectual property rights are essential for incentivizing creativity and innovation, which are fundamental in driving economic growth. Evidence from the WIPO treaty, the PRO-IP Act, UPOV and copyright scholars shows that IP laws facilitate the protection of innovations, providing creators with a tangible return on their investment of time and resources. Additionally, IP rights protect against stealing, with Operation In Our Sites, WIPO and the NIPRCC being key initiatives in ensuring that IP is protected. Ultimately, the right to intellectual property provides people and businesses with the chance to be compensated for their endeavours, thereby incentivizing the continued production of valuable works."
"
In this debate, the topic is 'We should abolish intellectual property rights', with proponents for this stance arguing that it prevents the continuous improvement of a service/product, restricts access to important information/products, is unfair, harms creativity/innovation, wastes money, and is ineffective. To support these claims, evidence has been presented such as Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property hampering the development of photography in England, Murray Rothbard's argument that intellectual property laws can hinder innovation, Richard Stallman's opinion that the term intellectual property should be rejected altogether, the increased duration and scope of intellectual property rights, the risk of users being held criminally liable for uploading copyrighted content, Professor Lessig's analysis of the tension between piracy and property, the General Assembly's recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples, the iniquity of the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights, natural rights arguments for intellectual property being weak, the concept of intellectual property not being libertarian, government not ordinarily enforcing monopolies, the expense of getting protection, copyright being a legal fiction created by the state, intellectual property rights limiting physical property rights, and criminal law being poorly suited for regulation of intellectual property law."
"
Given the topic 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', the debate is focused on the pros and cons of this proposition. The opposition argues that gun control is ineffective, gun ownership is a right, gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sport-shooting and gun ownership promotes self-protection. To support these claims, evidence is provided to show that criminals overwhelmingly obtain firearms through illegal channels and that background checks have had no effect on homicide rates. Additionally, it is shown that assault weapons bans have no significant effect on murder rates, that most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and that the U.S. Supreme Court has proclaimed the right to possess firearms. It is also argued that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sport-shooting, and that it promotes self-protection. The evidence provided for this claim includes a Pew Research report which showed that 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% for target or sport shooting, data from 2016 that showed that 10 million people used firearms for hunting, and a Gallup survey which found that 63% of gun owners own a firearm for personal safety or protection. Overall, the evidence provided supports the opponents' claims and clearly demonstrates why abolishing the right to keep and bear arms is not the best solution."
"
In the debate on whether we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms, those in favour of abolishing guns cite evidence showing that it would save lives. This includes statistics showing that firearms are a leading cause of death by homicide and suicide, as well as research showing that the legal purchase of a handgun is associated with an increased risk of violent death. Harvard professor David Hemenway also found that the more available guns are, the more homicides occur. This stance is further supported by evidence showing that gun ownership increases the risk of mass shootings and general gun violence, as the average gun owner is not trained to handle life-threatening situations, and that weapons are most often used in altercations that occur in the heat of the moment. Furthermore, the number of guns stolen during property crimes, as well as the number of guns found in the possession of state prison inmates, demonstrate that guns often fall into the wrong hands. Lastly, research shows that states with higher concentrations of guns have significantly more accidental gun deaths, and victims of these accidental shootings are more likely to live in households with a firearm. Overall, the evidence suggests that abolishing the right to keep and bear arms would lead to a decrease in firearm-related deaths, injuries and crimes."
"
This debate is about whether we should adopt an austerity regime. Supporters of this regime argue that it can improve public finances, while its opponents point out that it would have numerous negative impacts, such as cutting access to essential services, exacerbating recessions, being unfair to citizens, resulting in lower growth and job creation. Evidence shows that austerity policies in countries such as Greece, Spain, Argentina, Russia, and Turkey had harmful consequences, from an increase in child poverty and closure of children's centers, to a rise in homelessness, to people resorting to food banks in large numbers, to increased unemployment, particularly among women. In conclusion, austerity policies are not a solution to economic problems and can have severe negative consequences."
"
Summary: 
The topic for the debate is 'We should adopt an austerity regime'. Supporters of austerity argue that it improves economic measures, is important in the long term, increases stability, and is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts. It is also seen as essential in economically troubled times. Evidence from countries such as Canada, Latvia, Estonia, Greece, and Morocco demonstrates that austerity is associated with economic expansion, improved long-term economic performance, cost competitiveness, and macroeconomic stability. Furthermore, the World Bank has stated that if the debt-to-GDP ratio is greater than 77%, it can slow economic growth, and the U.S. is a prime example of austerity leading to a successful recovery."
"
In a debate over whether we should adopt atheism, the opposition has made three claims: first, that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion; second, that it lacks morality; and third, that people should be able to choose for themselves. The first claim has been supported with evidence including John Locke's views that atheism should not be tolerated, as well as numerous examples of religious discrimination, such as the boycott of The Golden Compass, criticism of atheism in Russia, and a ban on religious literature in Albania. The second claim is backed up by the views of evangelical theologian Douglas Wilson, who believes that belief is necessary to give a rational and coherent account of morality. Finally, the third claim is supported by evidence that individuals cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion, and that freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs should be subject only to certain limitations prescribed by law."
"
The debate topic is 'We should adopt atheism'. The positive stance in support of this topic is that Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it, it should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists, religions are immoral and people should not follow them, and science can adequately explain the universe. In support of this stance, Evidence 1 is Baggini arguing that atheists are better able to make moral evaluations as they are not restricted by religious imperatives. Evidence 2 is La Mettrie advocating that atheists are liberated from oppressive forces that stand in the way of progress. Evidence 3 is that atheists are not constrained by conflicting ideologies imposed by society. Evidence 4 is that atheists seek satisfaction from factual explanations rather than mythologies. Evidence 5 is that there is no need for atheists to fight over which religion is the supreme one. Evidence 6 is that Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away. Evidence 7 is the argument that belief in something inherently unobservable is irrational. Evidence 8 is that atheism is obligatory in the absence of evidence for God's existence. Evidence 9 is that religion confuses obedience with morality. Evidence 10 is that religion is a lie. Evidence 11 is that Christianity is particularly immoral with its unrealistic expectations and violent history. Evidence 12 is that some religions teach people to do horrible things. And Evidence 13 is that science can adequately explain the universe as exemplified by Stephen Weinberg."
"
The debate topic is 'We should adopt libertarianism'. The proponents argue that libertarianism will promote economic growth and increase individual freedom while its opponents argue that libertarianism harms economic growth, harms minorities and those who are worse off, is unjust and non-equal, and removes essential laws, infrastructure, and government services. Furthermore, they argue that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens. In summary, while libertarianism offers freedom to individuals, it ignores the social implications that are necessary for economic and social justice. The evidence supporting this includes the pejorative term vulgar libertarianism which is the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality, the critique of laws and regulations that lead to suppression of economic growth and hurt the public, the inconsistency of right-libertarianism and inalienable rights which allows and regards as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can, the application of these principles to the international context make a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale, and the difficulty in libertarianism's non-consensual limitations on freedom. Furthermore, there is empirical evidence to support that income inequality has increased with neoliberal policies, market-based solutions fail to address important social needs, and government action is necessary to protect human rights and reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"
In summary, Libertarianism has been proposed as an approach to increase economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness and fulfilment, as well as individual freedoms and liberties. Supporters of Libertarianism claim that it increases economic growth due to decreased taxation leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity. Furthermore, it increases freedom in the political system by protecting individual rights and property rights. Moreover, it increases happiness and fulfilment by allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives. Finally, it increases individual freedoms and liberties by allowing individuals to own and control property, and to take responsibility for their own lives."
"
In summary, the debate material centers on the topic of 'We should ban human cloning', with opponents arguing that cloning can be used for organ replication, to help those who can't otherwise have a child, to promote health, and to advance science and research. Evidence cited to support these claims includes a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, the ability to create customized organs that reduce the risk of rejection, the ability to improve the quality of life for those with medical conditions, the ability to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research, and the ability to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments. Furthermore, cloning can also help those struggling with infertility, provide a source of organs for those in need, help to study the genetic basis of infertility, and provide a source for stem cell research. Ultimately, cloning has a wide range of potential applications that could benefit society."
"
In conclusion, it is clear that human cloning should be banned due to a number of ethical, religious, unnatural, and safety-related concerns. The 1997 article in The New Republic by Kass, which discussed the wisdom of repugnance, articulated that repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. The National Council of Ethics of Portugal also published an opinion on the ethical implications of cloning which stated that it is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited. Furthermore, the Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and many religious ethicists have argued that it would create substantial issues of identity and individuality, as well as confusing the child resulting from cloning as to who his parents are. Additionally, cloning could result in long-term health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death, and can cause unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences. Therefore, for all these reasons, human cloning should be banned."
"
This debate focuses on whether we should ban private military companies. Those opposing the ban present four main arguments. The first is that private military companies can be financially beneficial, with evidence that they can result in cost savings for the government compared to using traditional military personnel, can provide more efficient services due to their quick response to changing circumstances, can provide access to specialized skills and expertise, and offer greater flexibility in terms of hiring and deploying personnel. The second argument is that private military companies are well-trained and better equipped, with evidence that they typically require their personnel to have high levels of training and experience, have access to state-of-the-art equipment, and invest in advanced technology. The third argument is that private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies cannot, or do not want, to do, with evidence that they have expertise in unconventional warfare and other specialized areas, can provide support services, and can carry out sensitive missions. The fourth and final argument is that private military companies can increase safety, with evidence that they can provide improved security in conflict zones, can provide more efficient use of resources, can carry out sensitive missions, and can provide support services."
"
Topic: We should ban private military companies
Stance: Positive 

Private military companies are controversial and have been accused of unethical and unlawful actions, as well as a lack of professionalism and loyalty to the hiring country. Furthermore, private military companies often prioritize profit over other considerations, potentially leading to a conflict of interest. Lastly, these companies may encourage conflict due to their financial incentives. 

Evidence supporting the claim that private military companies are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes includes a 2007 report by Human Rights Watch which found evidence of human rights violations committed by private military companies; a 2009 report by Amnesty International which found that the lack of accountability surrounding private military companies can lead to actions that violate human rights and commit crimes; a 2010 report by the Congressional Research Service which found evidence of unlawful killings committed by private military companies; a 2004 report by the United Nations which found evidence of private military companies using child soldiers in conflict zones; and a 2008 study published in the Journal of Business Ethics which found that private military companies can face a conflict of interest when serving both their client and the broader interests of society, leading to ethical violations. 

Evidence supporting the claim that private military companies are not professional includes a 2006 report by Human Rights Watch which found that private military companies often operate with limited accountability, making it difficult to hold them responsible for their actions; a 2009 report by Amnesty International which found that private military companies have been accused of violating international humanitarian law in conflict zones; a 2010 study published in the journal International Affairs which found that the chain of command for private military companies can be unclear, leading to confusion and decreased professionalism in their operations; a 2009 report by the Congressional Research Service which found that private military companies often operate with limited transparency, making it difficult to monitor their actions and ensure professional conduct; and a 2009 report by Amnesty International which found that private military companies have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, leading to increased risk and decreased professionalism in their operations. 

Evidence supporting the claim that private military companies cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country includes a 2012 report by the Congressional Research Service which found that private military companies can prioritize their contractual obligations to their client over their loyalty to the country they are operating in; a 2009 study published in the Journal of Military Ethics which found that private military companies can face a conflict of interest if they have loyalty to multiple countries; a 2008 report by the Project on Government Oversight which found that private military companies can prioritize their clients' interests over the interests of the country they are operating in; a 2007 report by Human Rights Watch which found that the lack of transparency surrounding private military companies can lead to actions that are not in the best interest of the hiring country; and a 2008 study published in the Journal of Business Ethics which found that private military companies can face a conflict of interest when serving both their client and the broader interests of society, potentially leading to a lack of trust in their actions. 

Evidence supporting the claim that private military companies main interest is profit includes a 2006 report by Human Rights Watch which found that private military companies often prioritize profit over other considerations, including ethical and legal considerations; a 2010 study published in the journal International Affairs which found that private military companies often operate with limited accountability, making it difficult to hold them responsible for actions taken in pursuit of profit; a 2009 report by Amnesty International which found that the high cost of private military services can incentivize companies to prioritize profit over other considerations; a 2008 report by the Project on Government Oversight which found that private military companies often operate with limited transparency, making it difficult to monitor their actions and ensure that they are not prioritizing profit over other considerations; and a 2006 report by the International Peace Institute which found that the private military industry is largely unregulated, allowing companies to prioritize profit over other considerations. 

Lastly, evidence supporting the claim that private military companies solicit engaging, or prolonging, conflict includes a 2008 report by the Project on Government Oversight which found that private military companies have a financial incentive to prolong conflicts; a 2006 report by the International Peace Institute which found that private military companies can encourage conflict by offering their services to clients who seek to engage in conflict; a 2010 study published in the journal International Affairs which found that private military companies profit from war; a 2009 report by Amnesty International which found that the presence of private military companies can increase the militarization of conflicts, potentially prolonging and escalating them; and a 2009 report by the Congressional Research Service which found that the lack of accountability surrounding private military companies can lead to actions that prolong and escalate conflicts. 

Overall, these arguments and evidence support the position that private military companies should be banned. The actions of these companies have been documented to be unethical, unprofessional, and prioritize profit over other considerations. Furthermore, they can encourage conflict by offering their services to those who seek to engage in conflict. Thus, banning private military companies would be beneficial for the protection of human rights and prevention of conflict."
"
The topic of this debate is 'We should ban the use of child actors'. Those against the ban argue that acting may be the child's dream, as evidenced by research that suggests that parents can influence a child's career aspirations, that children can be inspired by celebrity culture, and that some children have natural talent for acting. They further suggest that child performers achieve success and confidence as seen in the example of Ashwin Chitale winning a best child artist award. Moreover, they argue that child performers are necessary for certain roles as demonstrated by research that shows that casting children in certain roles can contribute to character development, increase audience engagement, and increase diversity in casting. Additionally, they suggest that child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation, as child labor laws should be followed. Finally, they argue that the parents should decide for their child, as research has demonstrated that parents have the right to autonomy and decision-making authority for their children, that they are guided by cultural and religious values, and that they are able to provide individualized attention and care for their children."
"
Given the topic 'We should ban the use of child actors', it is argued that child actors are vulnerable to exploitation and the loss of their childhood due to the lack of education, long working hours, lack of support, high levels of stress, and the pressure to perform. Studies have shown that these pressures can lead to developmental delays, emotional difficulties, social isolation, burnout, exhaustion, disinterest, physical abuse, and poor mental health, all of which can have long-term negative impacts on their well-being. Furthermore, child actors have a higher risk of facing problems later in life due to the stressful environment that they are subjected to. Thus, it is important to ban the use of child actors in order to protect them and ensure that they experience a healthy and safe childhood."

Topic: We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp

Stance: Opposing

Summary: The opponents of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp have presented three claims: first, closing the camp would harm national security due to the fact that the remaining detainee population is composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorists, with 17.5% confirmed to have reengaged in terrorist or insurgent activities. Furthermore, these detainees meet the criteria of a ""high-value enemy combatant"" and would pose a clear and continuing threat if released. Second, the camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives, as it provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world. Third, the camp is essential to gain intelligence, having been designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility."
"
In summary, this debate examines the need to close Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Supporters argue that detainees have the right to trial in US courts according to the Boumediene v. Bush case in the U.S. Supreme Court, and that the camp harms the US reputation and serves as a symbol of discrimination and injustice. Furthermore, it is argued that the camp is expensive and that personnel within the camp have committed crimes against prisoners, including physical abuse, torture, and unfair legal proceedings. The evidence provided to support these arguments, as well as the conclusion that Guantanamo Bay should be closed, is persuasive and justifies the claim."
"
In this debate, the motion is 'We should end affirmative action'. The opponents of this motion provide three claims in their argument, with evidence supporting each claim. The first claim is that affirmative action boosts diversity, with evidence showing that several studies have documented the gains in racial and gender equality as a result of affirmative action, that companies will struggle to meet diversity hiring goals without it, and that UC admission for minority students dropped after an affirmative action ban was imposed. The second claim is that affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past, with evidence showing that it has resulted in significant gains for minorities and women, that it helps to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination, and that it was endorsed by President Johnson in 1965. The third claim is that affirmative action reduces discrimination, with evidence showing that it levels the playing field and increases access to education for marginalized communities. In conclusion, the opponents of the motion believe that affirmative action is still necessary to combat existing discrimination and its effects on the marginalized communities."
"
The debate topic is 'We should end affirmative action'. Supporters of this stance argue that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice and reduces quality. Evidence supporting these claims include, among other things, Connerly's argument that people can achieve success without preferential treatment, studies from Princeton that claim ending affirmative action in university admissions would lead to 80% of placements currently offered to black and Latino students instead being given to Asian Americans, claims that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of those it's supposed to help, the fact that Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action, and arguments that affirmative action is a shallow solution that focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities. Additionally, opponents of affirmative action have argued that it is a form of 'reverse discrimination', and cite Supreme Court rulings in Sweden and the United States that have found affirmative action quotas to be discriminatory. Furthermore, Asian American students are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low, meaning even those with the highest test scores are not being given admission. Data from the University of Texas shows that, even when given admission, African-American students still have lower mean SAT scores and GPA's than their white and Asian American counterparts. Therefore, it can be argued that affirmative action is ineffective in providing minorities with equal opportunities, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces the quality of those admitted."
"
The debate topic is 'We should end mandatory retirement', with the stance being to end the policy. This stance is supported by several arguments and evidence. One argument is that mandatory retirement ages create opportunities for other workers. This is evidenced by a 2009 report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which found that such ages can increase job mobility, a 2010 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research which found that they can encourage older workers to retire, a 2012 report from the International Labour Organization which found that they can help boost employment for young people, a 2016 study from the World Economic Forum which found that they can promote intergenerational equity, and a 2019 study from the International Monetary Fund which found that they can stimulate economic growth. Another argument is that mandatory retirement age benefits those that are about to be retired. This is evidenced by a 2010 report from the Employee Benefit Research Institute which found that such ages can increase financial security for workers. Thus, this debate material provides several well-argued and well-persuaded points to suggest that mandatory retirement should be ended."
"
In summary, the topic of debate is ""We should end mandatory retirement"". The positive stance is that ending mandatory retirement has various advantages. Claim 1 is that a mandatory retirement age decreases institutional knowledge; evidence suggests that Air Traffic Controllers in the UK have no mandatory retirement age, and commercial airline pilots in the US have a mandatory retirement age of 65. Claim 2 is that a mandatory retirement age harms the economy; evidence shows that in the 1980s, mandatory retirement ages were abolished in a federal law, that they can decrease labor force participation and productivity, and that they can lead to an inefficient use of human capital. Claim 3 is that a mandatory retirement is not fair/discriminatory; evidence demonstrates that they can result in age discrimination, disregard individual circumstances, impair life satisfaction, and limit earning potential. Claim 4 is that a mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire; evidence supports this by showing that mandatory retirement can lead to decreased physical and cognitive function, decreased social connections, and increased feelings of loneliness. Finally, Claim 5 is that we should let everyone retire when they are ready; evidence suggests this can promote well-being, individual choice, intergenerational collaboration, active aging, and reduce the risk of poverty in old age."
"
Summary: 
The opponents of the motion 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons' argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. This argument is supported by the evidence that deterrence is a strategy that has been proven effective in preventing conflict and major military attacks for 70 years, as seen in the case of Ukraine, which was not protected by a nuclear umbrella, and suffered an invasion, while those countries that possess nuclear weapons remain safe from major frontal military attacks."
"
Summarizing the debate: 
The debate is about whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. The positive supporters argue that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands and provoke or escalate a disastrous military action. They cite evidence such as there being 2,000 metric tonnes of highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium which a terrorist could use to create a nuclear terrorism attack; recent propaganda from Isis claiming to obtain nuclear weapons within the year; the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons; accidents and errors leading to the use of nuclear weapons; Richard Nixon's depression as a potential factor that can influence nuclear weapons use; and the constellation of incidents around the Cuban Missile Crisis. All of these suggest that the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands is too high and should be eliminated."
"
In the debate of whether we should fight urbanization, the opponents argue that cities offer more opportunities, that urbanization benefits the economy, and that urbanization also benefits the environment. In terms of cities offering more opportunities, migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives. A study conducted in Zambia showed that when there were other viable investment opportunities in rural areas, the rates of rural-urban migration were lower. In Japan, during the 20th century, migration was characterized by urbanization as people moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. In terms of the economic benefits of urbanization, 12th century Western Europe saw a renewed focus on urbanization to stimulate economic growth. Manchester experienced an unplanned urbanization boom in the textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city. With the privatisation of agriculture, the urbanization of China's rural population, the development of rural industries and international investment, it was seen to bring higher productivity due to its positive externalities and economies of scale. In terms of its environmental benefits, biodiversity will increasingly be seen within the urban landscape. Urbanization also reduces the ecological footprint due to the same output being produced with fewer resources. Finally, urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies, making it a factor in the development of the green economy."
"
Summary: Urbanization has a number of negative consequences, which is why supporters of this topic believe we should fight urbanization. This includes economic and social disinvestment in rural areas, a rise in crime in urban areas, environmental degradation, and strain on resources in cities. Evidence shows that migration restrictions can benefit people in rural areas, that urbanization causes an increase in crime, pollution and resource depletion, and that urbanization leads to inadequate housing and health problems."
"
In the debate about whether we should introduce compulsory voting, opponents argue that abstaining from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote, and that citizens have a right not to vote. Furthermore, they argue that compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, and not everyone has the ability to go to vote, such as those who don't know basic facts about the Constitution or may be voting based on intentional disinformation. To support these claims, it has been suggested that abstention is a form of mild disapproval which can be used to indicate ambivalence about a measure or when someone has a certain position about an issue but it would not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. Furthermore, it has been argued that compulsory voting is a breach of civil liberties, can lead to banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising, and can skew election results by dampening the voice of the majority."
"
In the debate over whether we should introduce compulsory voting, those in favour argue that it increases representation, causes more people to become interested in politics, and that people have an obligation to vote. Evidence suggests that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement and significantly increases electoral support for leftist policy positions. It also prevents the political system from skewing towards the well off and well educated and increases the political education of the people. Additionally, compulsory voting increases the legitimacy of elected representatives and the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms. Lastly, people have fought for years for the right to vote, and those who can but don't take it for granted."
"
In the debate regarding the topic ""We should legalize cannabis"", the proponent side argues that cannabis should be made legal because of its potential medicinal benefits and the right of adults to make personal decisions regarding recreational use. However, the opponents of cannabis legalization put forward five main arguments. Firstly, they argue that cannabis harms the body, citing Dutch research which indicates an increase in THC content can result in impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger users, a 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health which shows that heavy smoking of cannabis changes blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke, and a British Lung Foundation study that smoking three cannabis joints has the same effect on airways linings as 20 cigarettes. Secondly, opponents claim that cannabis increases lack-of-judgement and accidents, with evidence showing that US drug enforcement commissioner Anslinger made this claim and a 2012 meta-analysis finding that acute cannabis use increased the risk of automobile crash. Furthermore, a 2020 study published in the American Journal of Public Health showed that the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent between 2000 to 2018. Thirdly, opponents argue that cannabis is a gateway-drug and addictive, citing a 2006 study by the Karolinska Institute which found that THC alters the opioid system, leading to increased abuse of other drugs, the Department of Justice's claim that cannabis has a high potential for abuse, and a study of 311 same-sex twins which found those that smoked cannabis before the age of 17 were 5 times more likely to move on to harder drugs. Fourthly, opponents argue that legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children, with evidence showing that despite $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005, 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain, and that Alaska's legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. Lastly, opponents argue that legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity, with evidence from California showing multiple massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza in the last few months."
"
The topic of the debate is 'We should legalize cannabis'. The stance is to support the positive side, where its proponents argue that legalization of cannabis is beneficial due to its comparatively lower harm than legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, its financial benefit, its potential to reduce black-market/criminal activity, its health benefits, and people's autonomy to do what they want to their own bodies. To support the argument, evidence includes a 2002 DAWN report, a New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group report, and Psychopharmacologist David Nutt's argument, which state that legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco are far more harmful than cannabis. Furthermore, marijuana legalization could save billions in government spending for prohibition enforcement, generate billions in tax revenues, reduce crime, and replace alcohol consumption. There is also evidence that cannabis has virtually no reports of fatal overdose in humans and is less harmful than certain legal drugs. Lastly, the drug's legalization could reduce black-market/criminal activity, and reduce drug-related violence, and people should have autonomy to do what they want to their own bodies, as supported by John Stuart Mill's harm principle."
"
The debate topic is: 'We should legalize prostitution'. Supporters of this topic argue that it would lead to less criminal activity, improved working conditions for those in the profession, and greater taxation revenues. Opponents of the topic counter that legalizing prostitution will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking, and will increase violence against women. They also contend that selling one's body is immoral.

To summarize, the debate revolves around whether or not prostitution should be legalized. Supporters of this topic believe it would lead to less criminal activity, improved working conditions, and increased taxation revenues. However, opponents argue that it would result in more sexually transmitted diseases, increased immoral behaviour such as pimping and human trafficking, and more violence against women. They also contend that it is immoral to sell one's body. The evidence for these claims is provided in the debate material, and includes a survey in Athens finding that 44 of 350 prostitutes were HIV positive, a study in Africa showing 84% of new HIV infections coming from encounters with prostitutes, reports of prostitution being a reservoir of STDs in developing countries, reports of increased human trafficking with legalization, Bob Herbert's statement about outside pimps controlling prostitutes, and Melissa Farley's argument that Nevada's high rape rate is linked to legal prostitution."
"
The debate topic is ""We should legalize prostitution"". The positive supporters of this stance argue that legalizing sex work boosts the economy, increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.), will allow to regulate those in the profession, and make the profession safer for women. Additionally, it is a valid choice over one's body, and can bring subjective well-being for those involved. This is supported by the evidence of historical records (e.g. David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard), scientific research (e.g. Alexandra Oliveira), legal frameworks (e.g. Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour) and public opinion polls (e.g. Dutch citizens). Furthermore, decriminalization or legalization could help to protect sex workers' rights, such as the right to work safely and free from discrimination, as well as the right to form professional associations or unions."
"
In the debate over whether sex selection should be legalized, its opponents argue that it can lead to gender imbalance, reaffirm gender stereotypes/biases, and create abortions/infanticide. The evidence they provide includes the fact that, since 1979, China's one-child policy has caused the largest number of missing women in any country, bioethicists consider it an ethical problem, and it can lead to social unrest and wars. Moreover, it is a result and an expression of cultural preference for sons, allowing prenatal discrimination to spread in China. Additionally, it can lead to the abortion of a female child if the parents know the gender, and even if not known it has resulted in female infanticide due to the son preference of parents. Furthermore, it is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions. All of this evidence supports the claim that sex selection should not be legalized."
"
This debate addresses the issue of whether we should legalize sex selection. Supporters of this idea assert that it is within the freedom of the parents to select the sex of the child, which allows for better family planning, makes the family more happy and complete, and prevents diseases in the child as well as abortions and infanticide. For instance, families may want a specific gender for their first-born, and this method allows them to achieve that goal. Additionally, Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) can be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, and the selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Lastly, sex selection eliminates the possibility of infanticide, where an unwanted sex of the baby is killed at birth. Overall, sex selection offers a variety of benefits that can improve the lives of many families."
"

In the debate over whether or not we should prohibit flag burning, opponents argue that it is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique and thus should be protected under the First Amendment. They point to cases such as the 1965 Tinker v. Des Moines case, where the Supreme Court ruled that students wearing armbands as a form of protest was a form of symbolic speech and thus was constitutionally protected. The court further ruled in 1984, in the case of Gregory Lee Johnson, that his protest of burning the American flag was sufficient enough to be seen as a form of protected expression. Furthermore, the Supreme Court held in 1989 that flag burning is protected by the First Amendment and thus can't be prohibited. Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority that flag desecration, like other forms of expression such as ethnic and religious epithets and vulgar repudiations of the draft, can't be prohibited simply because it is disagreeable to society."
"
In conclusion, The debate topic is ""We should prohibit flag burning"" and the positive supporters argue that flags are important symbols that should be respected and that flag burning is an inflammatory act. Evidence to support this argument includes Supreme Court Justice Warren’s opinion that laws against flag burning are constitutional, laws forbidding flag destruction or particular uses, and Hugo Black's opinion that flag burning is not protected speech. Additionally, some countries have ordinances forbidding publicly burning flags. This demonstrates that flag burning is an incendiary and offensive act that should be prohibited."
"
Summarizing, in the given debate topic of whether or not women should be prohibited from combat, its opponents have argued that there should be equality between men and women. This is because gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls, makes our communities safer and healthier, is good for the economy, and is a human right. Women can also create unique skills and strategies, prove to be an asset in combat, and can be just as capable in combat as men. Moreover, women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to and as long as they pass the tests. There is evidence to support all of these claims, including that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War, that they are less likely to become a disciplinary problem, and that there are certain combat positions in which they provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Ultimately, these opponents believe that women should not be prohibited from combat, and that if they meet the standards, they should be allowed to serve in whatever way they choose."
"
The debate topic is ""We should prohibit women in combat"". The debate stance is in support of the affirmative position that women should not serve in combat roles. This is because it is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density, making it harder for them to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. In addition, a yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units. Furthermore, the physical standards of the armed forces have been set to suit men, resulting in women attempting to over-stretch themselves in order to meet them. This has caused issues for women trying to pass physical tests, as well as a drop in unit morale due to distractions caused by the presence of women in direct combat. Finally, female soldiers are more likely to be captured in battle and are at a higher risk of sexual violence if they are taken prisoner. For these reasons, it is better for women to serve in safer roles in the military."
"
In the debate over whether we should subsidize journalism, opponents claim that government intervention carries the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. Evidence of this is shown through the Church of Scientology's complaint against Time Warner, the partisan reporting of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the anti-India bias observed in the BBC's reportage. They also argue that it is preferable to spend the money elsewhere, citing the federal government's lack of funds and how subsidies would decide winners and losers among the different forms of media. Lastly, they claim that journalism is like any other business and if it is not sustainable it should fail, pointing to the federal government's existing bailouts as a precedent."
"
The debate topic is 'We should subsidize journalism'. The positive stance argues that subsidizing journalism is important to make it viable, as it is essential to information-spreading and accountability. Additionally, subsidies can also increase the quality of journalism and help promote objectivity in reporting. The European Court of Human Rights highlighted the importance of journalistic sources, noting that protection of them is one of the basic conditions for press freedom, without which sources are deterred from assisting the press. This is further supported by the fact that digital media has made it increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information and the majority of Americans believe the traditional media are out of touch with what they want from their news. Similarly, Wikileaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism due to the lack of funding and resources, and the pandemic has made state subsidies even more important to secure the financial viability of media markets. Solutions journalism is an example of how media can provide an important feedback system to emerging challenges. Additionally, the Associated Press has become increasingly efficient in providing a vast quantity of accurate reporting to editors. Moreover, the Trilateral Commission found that the development of television journalism has contributed to the undermining of governmental authority. Finally, providing subsidies can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents, as well as helping to promote education in journalism to empower the public. "

Topic: We should subsidize space exploration

Stance: Opponents

Summary: Space exploration is a costly and ineffective use of money that should be spent on more pressing needs such as reducing poverty and crime or tackling global warming. Private companies like SpaceX have demonstrated they can accomplish feats in space, but they often rely on government contracts and subsidies to do so. Moreover, the money spent on space exploration is largely wasted as it has little scientific benefit and the costs of satellite technology and rockets are exorbitant. The money could be better spent on efforts that directly improve life on Earth, such as investing in universities, healthcare, and research to find cures for diseases."
"
The given topic for this debate is whether we should subsidize space exploration. Those who support the positive side of the debate argue that space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets; improve science/technology; is financially beneficial; is necessary for the future survival of humanity; and unravels information about the universe. Evidence provided include space colonies supplying clean energy necessary for human survival, being able to support habitats thousands of times larger than Earth, satellite imagery and climate data aiding agriculture, Gagarin’s 1961 flight facilitating biomedicine and materials science research, satellite broadband internet access driving down data cost, and space activities helping to understand the origin and evolution of the universe. These arguments suggest that space exploration could have significant positive impacts for humanity. Subsidizing it, then, would be beneficial to society."
"
The topic of the debate is whether we should subsidize vocational education. Opponents of this argument make four claims: that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes, is expensive, leads to an influx in those professions, and is not a good career choice. Evidence supporting these claims includes: a 2018 Urban Institute study that found that subsidizing vocational education may not provide a good return on investment; a 2020 National Bureau of Economic Research study that found that it can divert money from other important programs; a 2019 Government Accountability Office report that found that it may not adequately address workforce development needs; a 2020 National Science Board study that found that it may not ensure quality; a 2019 American Federation of Teachers report that found that it may have limited benefits for the economy; a 2018 Center for American Progress report that found that it can be expensive; a 2019 National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium study that found it can be challenging; a 2021 National Conference of State Legislatures study that found it can compete with other important priorities for funding and resources; a 2019 National Skills Coalition report that found it can reduce funding for other important programs; a 2020 National Center for Postsecondary Research study that found it can be limited by the ability to scale; a study that found that a subsidy program in Germany led to a significant increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs; a study that found the program increased the demand for skilled workers; a study that found government subsidies for vocational education in Switzerland led to a significant increase in enrollment in vocational programs; a 2018 National Skills Coalition study that found many vocational education programs prepare students for low-wage jobs; a 2014 National Center for Education and the Economy study that found many vocational education programs offer limited transferability of skills; an Education Trust 2016 report that found many vocational education programs do not provide adequate support for non-college bound students; and a 2019 American Federation of Teachers report that found many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement."
"
In the debate over whether or not we should subsidize vocational education, proponents of the positive stance argue that doing so can increase access for those with fewer resources, better fit many students' learning styles and career goals, provide a good career choice, and benefit the entire market and society. Evidence from the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education can increase access for low-income students and improve workforce development. Additionally, a report by the National Center for Education Research in 2020 showed that job opportunities can increase for those who may not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education. Vocational education provides hands-on, practical learning better fit the learning styles and interests of many students compared to traditional classroom-based education, and it can provide a more direct path to employment. It can also increase economic mobility, better align with local labor market needs, and decrease student debt. Furthermore, investments in vocational education can address workforce shortages, boost economic growth, increase workforce productivity, enhance social mobility, and promote workforce diversity. All of these are beneficial for the entire market and society."
