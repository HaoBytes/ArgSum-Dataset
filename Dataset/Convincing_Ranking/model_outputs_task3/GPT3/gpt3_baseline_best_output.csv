The debate topic is: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'. The opponents argue that assisted suicide should not be criminalized because it provides dignity to the person that wants to commit it, reduces suffering, allows individuals to have the freedom to choose to end their life, and benefits terminally ill patients. Evidence supporting these claims includes research from Dignity in Dying which shows that around 350 Britons have traveled to Switzerland to end their life due to a lack of protection from the law, criteria from the legal system concerning unbearable and hopeless suffering, and autonomy and quality-of-life-based arguments in favour of euthanasia. It is clear that the opponents to this debate believe that assisted suicide should not be criminalized."
"
In conclusion, this debate centers around the question of whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offence or not. The positive stance of the debate argues that assisted suicide should be a criminal offence due to its ability to solicit someone to die to their own benefit, the possibility of people getting better, the violation of a doctor's role, the right to self-harm/harm others, and the lack of clear judgement from people who are ill. Evidence was provided for each of these points, including examples such as the need for a patient to be an adult in a certain medical condition, the physician-assisted suicide not being performed for the sake of a patient's depression, and the lack of proof that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others."
"
This debate is about the topic of 'Homeschooling should be banned', with opponents arguing that it should not be banned. The primary arguments against a ban are that homeschooling is often the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students, can be personalized to the child's pace/needs, is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education, and provides a good learning environment with broader socialization than a typical classroom. Evidence to support these claims includes a Gallup poll showing a change in attitude from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001, research showing mainstream schools failing to meet the requirements of pupils with SEN, and Holt's statement that homeschooling is not an answer to badness of schools. Overall, opponents of a ban argue that parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children, and that homeschooling can provide an environment that meets the needs of the student."
"
Debate Script Summary: 
The debate is about the controversial topic of whether homeschooling should be banned or not. The affirmative side argues that homeschooling should be banned as it cannot be regulated or standardized, which puts vulnerable children at risk and prevents them from gaining essential social skills. They also point out that mainstream schools have higher educational quality and parents are not qualified as teachers to provide the depth and breadth of learning their children require. The evidence used to support their claims are: (1) Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized due to the lack of social safety nets and the increased chance of child abuse; (2) mainstream schools are essential for social skills and democratic values; (3) mainstream schools are of higher educational quality and; (4) parents are not qualified as teachers to provide the necessary depth and breadth of learning their children require."

The debate topic at hand is 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'. Proponents of the idea believe that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory in order to protect children against potentially deadly illnesses and provide public health benefits. However, opponents of the idea have three primary claims against making such vaccinations mandatory. 

The first claim is that routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous. This is supported by the example of Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, which was pulled from the market after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction). 

The second claim is that mandatory vaccinations contradict basic rights. Evidence supporting this claim is found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity.

The third claim is that routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy. Evidence to support this claim can be found in Mayo Clinic, which states that natural infection often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.

In conclusion, proponents and opponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations have well-founded arguments for their respective positions. However, with the availability of evidence to support the safety and necessity of routine vaccinations, proponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations are the ones with the stronger argument."
"
In conclusion, routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. This is because they are effective, save lives, and help to protect others from preventable diseases. Evidence supporting this claim includes the 69% drop in the rate of invasive pneumococcal disease in those of less than two years of age after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, and the 74% decrease in childhood deaths from measles due to the measles vaccine. Additionally, the pertussis vaccine has been effective at preventing illness, saving an estimated half a million lives in 2002, and preventing the biggest pertussis outbreak since 1955. Vaccine hesitancy has also contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases, with measles cases increasing by 30% in 2019. Therefore, in order to prevent virus/disease spreading, routine child vaccinations should be mandatory."
"
This debate is about whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. The opposition argues that regulation is ineffective, harms privacy, hinders freedom of speech and other democratic rights, is an intrusion into the affairs of private companies, and could lead to political abuses by the government. Evidence provided in support of these claims includes the lack of enforcement of the European Union's data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation; a survey of US adults revealing a lack of control over personal information; reports of Facebook restricting Vietnamese content following the passage of a cybersecurity law; US debate regarding government intervention in the market system; and political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 US and UK elections."
"
The debate topic is ‘Social media platforms should be regulated by the government’, and it is in support of the affirmative side. It is argued that social media regulation is essential to protect the younger audiences, to deal with fake news, to benefit society at large, to help with negative content, and to deal with malicious users. As evidence, a statement from Matt Lamb in a statement saying that the government must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation; Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu's question on whether Twitter has killed the First Amendment; a statement from Ofcom’s Chief Executive on the need for sensible, balanced rules; Pierre DeBois' remarks on enterprises' need to pay attention to how social media platforms impact the real world; and a survey finding that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011 are presented. From the evidence, it can be seen that the regulation of social media is important in order to protect audiences, to combat fake news, to benefit society, to tackle negative content, and to address malicious users."
"
This debate is about whether the United States of America is a good country to live in. The opponents of this topic argue that the US has unfair health and education policies, a problematic/divisive political system, a negative culture, high taxation/high costs of living, inequality/poverty, is unsafe, and is xenophobic/racist. Evidence presented to support these claims includes that in 2007 8.1 million children under 18 years old were without health insurance, Thomas Carothers and Andrew O’Donohue's study of polarization across nations indicate that polarization runs particularly deep in the US, cultural factors may be as important as health risks in the US, according to a study that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association, almost half of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security, the US' Gini coefficient is the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe in a survey and an experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names. These facts suggest that living in the US is not a good option."
"
In summary, the US is a great country to live in due to its excellent economy, healthcare and education systems, stunning nature and environment, democratic rights and freedoms, a unique culture, great people and powerful nation status, as well as a plethora of opportunities for individuals. Evidence from Caleb Silver with Investopedia states that the US controls the top spot in the rankings of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The advanced medical milieu that Americans enjoy has led to the world’s best cancer survival rates and lower mortality rates for heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, the US is home to an abundance of wildlife, protected by the National Park Service, as well as a bill of rights ensuring democratic rights and freedoms for all. The 'melting pot' of cultures has created an American culture which is now impacting the world. The US has also been ranked the world's most powerful country for the seventh time, and jobs in the USA are unrivaled. All these factors make the US a great country to live in."
"
The debate topic is 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned'. Proponents of this idea believe that celibacy should be abolished, while opponents argue that it should be retained. Opponents of the vow of celibacy argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, is a strong religious belief, makes the priests to be perceived as holy, is chosen by priests, and religious experiences and traditions should be maintained. Furthermore, they state that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts. To support their claims, opponents cite evidence such as that clerical celibacy is seen as a special gift from God and that a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests, and deacons should abstain from conjugal relations. Furthermore, they point out that celibacy became almost universal when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men and that a law had not been promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Additionally, they state that Siricius declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple and that priests have undergone psycho-sexual development training. Thus, opponents of the vow of celibacy present a strong case for why celibacy should be retained."
"
This debate topic is ""The vow of celibacy should be abandoned"". The positive argument states that celibacy is outdated, too pressuring, unhealthy and unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Supporting evidence includes Lakeland's belief that celibacy should become optional and that change is inevitable, Elizabeth Abbott's belief that suppressing urges and hiding sexual behaviour warps people, the fact that celibacy is an unnatural act for all living organisms, the connection between celibacy and the clergy sexual abuse scandals and Gerard's complaint about the York canons refusing to be ordained as priests. In conclusion, given all this evidence, it is clear that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned."
"
In the given debate, the opponents argue that we should not abandon marriage as it benefits children, it is important for people, makes them happy, makes the couple closer and provides important financial benefits. The evidence supporting this argument includes that children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused, have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, and are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager. Additionally, marriage is important for people either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons, as it is one of life's greatest blessings, helps to reduce mental and behavioral disorders, criminal activity, and substance abuse. Additionally, it provides people with happiness, makes them closer, and gives important financial benefits such as the higher standard deduction for a couple."
"
In conclusion, marriage should be abandoned because it preserves norms that are harmful to women, is unstable, ties people up with unfair obligations, and most of the advantages of marriage are achieved through a monogamous relationship. To begin, research has shown that the effects of marriage are worse for women than men and that women initiate a majority of divorces due to the negative effects. Additionally, the claim that ""half of marriages end in divorce"" was once true but even in its time, marriage meant an obligation for wives to obey their husbands and serve them. Finally, although marriage promises many benefits, a monogamous relationship is just as capable of fostering emotional intimacy and long-lasting relationships. Therefore, marriage should be abandoned in favor of a monogamous relationship for these reasons."
"
In this debate, we argue that school uniform should be abandoned. Evidence has been presented to show that children can still express themselves in other ways, which does not involve clothing regulations, and that free speech is guaranteed by the Constitution. On the contrary, school uniform reduces bullying, as research by the Schoolwear Association has shown, as well as creating a sense of equality and unity. Additionally, they encourage discipline and focus on learning by taking away the students’ focus from their attire and from their peers’ thoughts. Lastly, the cost savings are minimal, according to a national survey of 517 US school leaders. Thus, the evidence presented suggests that school uniform should not be imposed and should be abandoned."
"
In summary, this debate is about whether or not we should abandon the use of school uniforms. Supporters of this stance argue that school uniform can harm learning and creativity, restrict students' self-expression, be expensive, be uncomfortable or sexist and increase conformity or harm individuality. Senior Alyse Madsen said that strict dress codes infringe on a student's self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity. Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show that students often feel uniforms allow for comparison between their bodies and others. Research by the Children's Society showed that the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. According to a GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students. Furthermore, research has shown that allowing students to dress themselves can help with independent thinking and better prepare them for adulthood. All of these factors taken together make a strong argument for why we should abandon the use of school uniforms."
"
The debate topic being discussed is 'We should abolish capital punishment'. Those in favor of abolishing the death penalty argue that it does not bring closure to the victims’ families, is not a suitable punishment for the most heinous of crimes, and it does not serve as an effective deterrent. On the other hand, opponents of abolishing the death penalty argue that it can bring closure to the victims’ families, can be suitable for certain crimes, and can deter potential criminals. 

Evidence supporting those in favor of abolishing capital punishment includes that the United Nations Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights argues that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. Further, a study conducted by Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd found that executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. 

Evidence for the opponents of abolishing capital punishment includes an article written by Leslie Rutledge, JD, and Tom Cotton, JD, that argued capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. The article also noted that the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. It also provides an example of Daniel Lewis Lee, a member of a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution. 

In conclusion, the debate regarding whether we should abolish capital punishment is a complex one with strong arguments for both sides. Opponents argue that the death penalty can bring closure to victims’ families, is an appropriate punishment for severe crimes, and can be an effective deterrent. Supporters of abolishing the death penalty argue that the death penalty does not bring closure to the victims’ families, is not suitable for the most heinous of crimes, and it does not serve as an effective deterrent. Ultimately, this debate is one that must be resolved on a case-by-case basis."
"
This debate is about the abolishment of capital punishment, with the affirmative side claiming that state-sanctioned killing is wrong, that it harms the disenfranchised and that it is irreversible. To support their claims, they cite evidence that the death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner, that its financial cost is eight times greater than a non-death penalty case and that statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it. Furthermore, H. Lee Sarokin claims that deterrence does not play a part in the decision to commit murder, making capital punishment an unnecessary risk. Therefore, it is clear that capital punishment should be abolished."
"
The debate topic is 'We should abolish intellectual property rights'. The opponents' stance is that intellectual property rights should not be abolished as they incentivize creativity and innovation, investment in developing new products, protect against stealing, and allow people to be compensated for their innovations. As evidence, proponents cite incentives theories which view intellectual property as necessary for encouraging new creative works. Furthermore, a joint research project by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth. In addition, copyright preserves intellectual property like movies, music, and television shows. Lastly, exclusive rights to intellectual property allow the owners to benefit financially and pay associated research and development costs. Therefore, abolishing intellectual property rights would not be beneficial for creativity, innovation, or investment."
"
In this debate, we will be discussing whether we should abolish intellectual property rights. Those who support the abolition of intellectual property rights argue that they prevent the continuous improvement of a service or product, restrict access to important information or products, are unfair, harm creativity and innovation, waste money, and are ineffective. 
Evidence suggests that intellectual property monopolies can impede health (in the case of pharmaceutical patents), prevent progress, and benefit concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses. Users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable, and this conduct is so poorly defined. Additionally, Roderick T. Long has argued that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Petra Moser has also asserted that patent policies which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors may discourage innovation. Further, the costs of obtaining intellectual property rights can be expensive. Lastly, Tucker did not believe in intellectual property rights in the form of patents, on the grounds that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot rightfully be held as property. 
Based on this evidence, it appears that intellectual property rights have many potential drawbacks, and should be abolished to benefit the public."
"
This debate addresses the topic of whether we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. Opponents of the motion argue that gun control is ineffective, that gun ownership is a right, that gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting, and that it promotes self protection. To support the claim that gun control is ineffective, opponents cite a 2016 Lancet study that found that most state-level gun control laws did not reduce firearm death rates, and that of the 25 state laws studied, nine were associated with higher gun death rates. The opponents also note that gun ownership is a right and that it is held in nearly the same esteem as other rights laid out in the US Constitution, according to a survey conducted by Gallup. Further, they cite statistics showing that in 2016, 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges. Finally, they point to a survey by Gallup that found that most gun owners cited personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. On this basis, opponents argue that the right to keep and bear arms should not be abolished."
"
In this debate, the affirmative position proposes that the right to keep and bear arms should be abolished. The affirmative position is based on four main claims. Firstly, that banning guns would save lives, supported by evidence from Missouri, which showed a 25 percent increase in gun-related killings after the repeal of the state’s permit law. Secondly, that gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence, supported by research showing that for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership, there will be three to five more mass shootings per five years. Thirdly, that guns can fall into the wrong hands, supported by an example from Texas where a man with a domestic violence conviction was able to buy guns and carry out a massacre. Finally, that guns lead to accidental deaths, supported by a 2001 study that showed a correlation between gun ownership and unintentional firearm injuries. The affirmative position argues that these risks to human life make it necessary to abolish the right to keep and bear arms."
"
In this debate, the topic is 'We should adopt an austerity regime.' The proponents argue that austerity is necessary to maintain a healthy economy, while the opponents argue that it has several detrimental effects such as reducing access to essential services, extending recessions, creating more unemployment, reducing growth, and being unfair to citizens. Evidence to support the opponent's claims includes the Institute of Fiscal Studies’ estimation of a 0.4% cut to unprotected areas of social security, prisons, local government, and adult education; the financial press and many economists’ observations of slow recovery in several European countries; a significant association between IMF-required austerity and rising inequality as well as poverty levels; the OECD average slowing from 5% before the crisis to 2.5% after the crisis; and Alessandro Turrini’s finding that austerity policies may be responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation."
"
This debate is about whether we should adopt an austerity regime. Supporters of this stance argue that austerity has a number of economic and stability benefits. For example, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina has shown that fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions.' Further, according to Arellano (2008) model simulations, cutting government consumption may raise the default premium in the short run. Austerity can also increase stability by providing a buffer against external shocks as seen in the German model of adjustment, which compensates for the contraction of internal demand with increased external demand. Moreover, austerity can be used to reduce deficits and pay debts, as was seen in the US between 1920 and 1921, where the federal budget was cut by almost 50%, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. Finally, it can be used to stimulate growth during economically troubled times."
"
The debate is over the proposition that we should adopt atheism. Opponents argue that atheism discriminates against religious people/violates freedom of religion, atheism lacks morality, and people should choose for themselves whether atheism should be adopted. Evidence given for the first claim is that the Albanian Constitution of 1976 and the Penal Code of 1977 both imposed prison sentences for religious propaganda and production, distribution, or storage of religious literature. Evidence for the second claim is that Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life. Lastly, evidence for the third claim is from Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs as prescribed by law and as necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Opponents of the proposition are making the case that we should not adopt atheism because it discriminates against religious people, lacks morality, and people should have the right to choose for themselves whether they wish to adopt atheism."
"
Summary:
This debate focuses on the argument that people should adopt atheism. The proponents of this view suggest that atheism is beneficial to those who choose to adopt it since they are free from any confusions that may arise from religious texts. Additionally, atheism is obligatory due to a lack of evidence of God's existence. Moreover, religions may be immoral and advocate for practices that are unjust, such as the Bible teaching people to treat their slaves. Lastly, science can adequately explain the Universe and this might be one of the greatest contributions to civilization that scientists can make."
"
This debate is about whether we should adopt libertarianism, which is a philosophical view that advocates for individual liberty and limited government intervention. Proponents of libertarianism argue that it promotes economic growth, protects individual liberty, and ensures equal justice. However, opponents of libertarianism argue that it harms economic growth, harms minorities/those who are worse off, is unjust/non-equal, removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services, and does not protect the rights of citizens. 

The opponents of libertarianism present evidence to support their claims, including that right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, leading to monopolies and stifled innovation. Furthermore, James P. Sterba argued that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises requires the redistribution of wealth in order to improve economic health. Economist Joseph Stiglitz also argues that market failures can result in unequal outcomes, requiring government intervention to address. In addition, environmentalists argue that markets fail to address important social needs and that government action is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, libertarians cannot protect the rights of citizens, as this is the role of the government. 

In conclusion, while proponents of libertarianism may argue that it promotes individual liberty and economic growth, the evidence provided by opponents suggests that it is not an effective system for addressing social issues, protecting the rights of citizens, and ensuring economic stability."
"
In this debate, we will argue that we should adopt libertarianism as a system of governance. This stance is supported by evidence that libertarianism increases economic growth, increases freedom in the political system, increases happiness/fulfillment, and increases individual freedom/liberties. For example, Americans for Limited Government argue that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity. Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. Sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness. Lastly, economist Murray Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle is based on the premise that either a group of people can own another group of people, or no single person has full ownership over one's self. Ultimately, the only alternative is self-ownership, which is both axiomatic and universal. Therefore, libertarianism increases economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfillment, and individual freedom/liberties."
"
In summary, this debate is about whether or not we should ban human cloning. The opponents of this motion are arguing that cloning should not be banned because it can be used for organ replication, to help those who can’t otherwise have a child, to promote health, and to promote science and research. Evidence to support these arguments includes a study from the Journal of the American Medical Association which found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases; a study from the New England Journal of Medicine which found that cloning can help to reduce the transmission of genetic diseases; a study from the Fertility and Sterility journal which found that cloning could be used to better understand the processes of reproduction; and a study from the Journal of Evolutionary Biology which found that cloning can help to better understand the process of evolution."
"
In this debate, we are discussing the issue of whether we should ban human cloning. Supporters of the ban argue that cloning is not understood enough yet, that it is unethical/anti-religious, that it is unnatural, and that it is unsafe. As evidence, they cite Kass's argument that a society which tolerates cloning has forgotten how to shudder and has said yes to converting procreation into manufacture. They also point to the Holy See's position that cloning for research purposes is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one. They further cite Richard McCormick's view that cloning disrupts the familial order by removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, as well as a report by the Council of Europe which highlights the potential for abuse of cloning technology. Taken together, these arguments provide strong support for banning human cloning."
"
In the debate, opponents of the motion to ban private military companies have presented four main arguments and evidence supporting those arguments. First, it is claimed that hiring private military companies is financially beneficial; this is supported by a study in International Affairs that found it can reduce bureaucracy and speed up decision-making. Second, it is argued that they are well-trained and better equipped than regular armies; this is evidenced by a 2007 Senate Armed Services Committee report that showed private military companies are able to quickly respond to changing circumstances. Third, it is argued that private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that the army cannot, or do not want, to do; this is supported by a RAND Corporation report that showed that they can take on non-core tasks, allowing the army to focus on its primary mission. Finally, it is argued that private military companies increase safety; this is evidenced by a report by the Heritage Foundation in 2010 that showed that they can provide support services, such as logistics and communications, freeing up regular army personnel to focus on other tasks."
"
Given the topic 'We should ban private military companies', its positive supporters argue that private military companies are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes, are not professional, cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country, main interest is profit and solicit engaging, or prolonging, conflict. Evidence supporting this argument includes reports by the Congressional Research Service in 2010 and 2009, Amnesty International in 2009, Human Rights Watch in 2007, the International Peace Institute in 2006, and the Congressional Research Service in 2009, which found evidence of unlawful killings, poorly trained personnel, lack of transparency, unregulated industry, and lack of accountability leading to prolonging and escalating conflicts, respectively. Therefore, private military companies should be banned to ensure the safety of civilians, loyalty to the hiring country, and to reduce the profit-oriented nature of military operations."
"
This debate discusses the issue of whether we should ban the use of child actors. Those opposing the ban argue that acting may be the child's dream, as supported by a report by the American Psychological Association in 2010 which found that acting can provide a way for children and young people to express their emotions and can contribute to their desire to pursue a career in the performing arts. Furthermore, child performers can achieve success and confidence, as seen in the case of Ashwin Chitale who won the best child artist award. Child performers are also necessary for roles, according to a report by the Actors Equity Association in 2014, which found that casting children in certain roles can increase audience engagement and make the production more appealing to a wider audience. The opponents of the ban also believe that child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation, evidenced by the fact that one challenge for the cast and crew was filming around a child actor, meaning that the show had to obey child labor laws. Lastly, the opponents argue that the parents should decide for their child, supported by a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2018 which found that parents have legal protection for their right to make decisions for their children, and that this protection should be upheld."
"
This debate is about whether or not we should ban the use of child actors. Supporters of the motion argue that child performers are at risk of exploitation, experience a loss of innocence and childhood, have high levels of pressure and stress, and are likely to experience long-term negative effects on their personal, professional, and academic lives. Evidence presented includes a study published in the Journal of Adolescence in 2018 which found that child performers may experience long-term negative effects, a study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014 which found that child performers may be at risk of human trafficking due to their vulnerability, a study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014 which found that child performers may experience a loss of innocence and childhood, and a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2016 which found that child performers may experience burnout due to high levels of pressure and stress. In addition, an example was given of an actor, Herbert, who experienced a lack of identity after he had lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty. Given the evidence presented, it is clear that banning the use of child actors is a necessary step to protect the welfare of the children involved."
"
This debate is about whether we should close Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp. The opposition believes that closing the camp would harm national security, it is better for prisoners than the alternatives, and is essential to gain intelligence. The evidence to support the claim that closing the camp would harm national security is that 17.5 percent of former Guantanamo detainees have reengaged in terrorist or insurgent activities, with 111 of those detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven transferred during the Obama administration. Additionally, an estimated 12.7 percent of all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. 

The evidence to support the claim that Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is better for prisoners than the alternatives is that it is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the world's population.

The evidence to support the claim that the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is essential to gain intelligence is that key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'. 

Given the evidence presented, it is clear that closing Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp could have serious implications for national security, the safety of prisoners, and the ability to gain important intelligence. Therefore, the opposition believes that the camp should not be closed."
"
In the debate on the closing of Guantanamo Bay detention camp, the positive supporters claim that the detainees have the right to trial in US courts, as the US Supreme Court has ruled that prisoners held for more than two years may challenge their captivity in US courts. They also argue that the detention camp harms the US image and serves as a recruiting tool for terrorists, due to its tarnished reputation of injustice and oppression. Additionally, the detention camp is extremely expensive, with its cost estimated to be $2.7 million per prisoner, and personnel commit crimes against the prisoners, including physical abuse and torture. Finally, unjust treatment and tactics are used in the camp, such as depriving detainees of sleep, shackling them in painful positions and forcing them to drink large amounts of water. All of these arguments, as evidenced by the given evidence, serve to demonstrate that Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed."
"
This debate is centered around whether or not we should end affirmative action. Proponents of the motion believe that it should be ended, while opponents argue that it is beneficial for diversity, necessary to compensate for the past, and effective at reducing discrimination. To support these claims, opponents cite the case of Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, in which the APALC argued that Asian students 'benefited from exposure to a diverse student body.' In addition, historian Roger Wilkins has argued that Blacks have had a long history of discrimination and oppression that should be taken into account, as opposed to expecting Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians, which is unrealistic. Finally, the example of Wesolowski supporting affirmative action for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001 is used to illustrate how affirmative action can reduce discrimination against women and aboriginals. 

In conclusion, it is clear that there are several arguments in favor of affirmative action, demonstrating that it is beneficial to diversity, necessary to combat discrimination, and necessary to compensate for the injustices of the past."

This debate topic is whether we should end affirmative action. Those who support this stance argue that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Evidence 1, related to the first claim, is a case where Harvard University is being sued for capping the number of admissions for Asian American students, which is celebrated on the backs of minorities. Evidence 1, related to the second claim, shows that privileged African Americans are gaining professional upward mobility, while the less-skilled and less-educated African Americans fall behind. Evidence 1, related to the third claim, is the same as for the first, showing that Harvard University is being sued for capping the number of admissions for Asian American students. Evidence 1, related to the fourth claim, is also the same as for the first, with Harvard University being sued for capping the number of admissions for Asian American students. Lastly, Evidence 1, related to the fifth claim, is data from the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, which reveals large differences in mean SAT scores and mean high-school grade-point averages across different races. Overall, the evidence presented is convincing that affirmative action should be ended."
"
The debate revolves around the topic of whether we should end mandatory retirement. Those who oppose the idea contend that mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers, as it allows younger workers to enter the workforce and contribute to economic activity, as shown in a study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019. Furthermore, mandatory retirement ages can increase financial security for workers, as they can receive pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a specified age, as evidenced by a report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in 2010."
"
The debate topic is 'We should end mandatory retirement'. The positive stance is that mandatory retirement is detrimental and should be abolished. Claim_1 states that a mandatory retirement age decreases institutional knowledge, evidenced by the example of commercial airline pilots in the United States, whose retirement age was increased from 60 to 65 in 2007. Claim_2 argues that a mandatory retirement age harms the economy, as it limits labor market flexibility and employers' ability to respond to changing economic conditions, according to a study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019. Claim_3 posits that a mandatory retirement is not fair or equitable, as it promotes intergenerational inequity, reducing the diversity of skills and experiences available in the workplace and limiting opportunities for intergenerational collaboration, according to a study by the World Economic Forum in 2016. Claim_4 states that mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, evidenced by a study published in The Gerontologist which found that mandatory retirement can lead to decreased social connections and increased feelings of loneliness. Lastly, Claim_5 is that we should let everyone retire when they are ready, as it can reduce the risk of poverty in old age, according to a study by the World Economic Forum in 2016. Therefore, mandatory retirement should be abolished, as it harms institutional knowledge, the economy, social equity, quality of life, and financial security."
"    - Evidence 2: Countries with nuclear weapons are seen as more powerful and can therefore deter aggression from other nations.

Debate Summary:
The debate surrounds the topic of whether or not we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Those who oppose this stance assert that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. They back this up with evidence that deterrence has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years, and that countries with nuclear weapons are seen as more powerful and can therefore deter aggression from other nations."
"
In this debate, we are discussing whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Those who support this position argue that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands, as evidenced by cases of theft and loss of nuclear materials that are sometimes never recovered. It is also argued that nuclear weapons can provoke or escalate a disastrous military action, as demonstrated by the constellation of incidents around the Cuban Missile Crisis. These events suggest that when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences will lead to a major crisis, and that luck was the only thing that saved us from a disastrous outcome during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Therefore, the supporters of this position believe that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons."
"
In this debate, we are discussing the merits and drawbacks of urbanization. On the one hand, opponents of the motion argue that cities offer more opportunities, as people from rural areas move to larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Urbanization also has the potential to benefit the economy, as it could lead to more efficient economies, technological developments, diversity of products and occupations, and greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility. Lastly, it could also benefit the environment, as urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. On the other hand, those who fight urbanization believe that it can lead to the overcrowding of cities, displacement of people, and destruction of rural areas. They argue that the advantages of urbanization are outweighed by its negative effects on the environment, economy, and society."
"
In this debate, the topic of discussion is ‘We should fight urbanization’. It is argued that restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically and socially, that urbanization causes crime, harms the environment, and is causing a strain on the cities' resources. Evidence supporting this position includes findings from a study in India which showed that protection of natural resources eliminated causes of rural to urban migration, and surveys which revealed that urbanization and coastal development contributed to increased degradation of the marine environment. Additionally, the rapid process of urbanization had the consequence of creating irregular neighborhoods. Therefore, it is clear that the impacts of urbanization need to be countered through appropriate regulations and measures."
"
In the debate about whether compulsory voting should be introduced or not, the opponents of the topic argue that abstaining from a vote is a way of reflecting one's preferences, citizens have a right not to vote, compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, and not everyone has the ability to go to vote. This is evidenced by Herbert Spencer noting that abstaining from a vote would be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, Minchin’s statement that compulsory voting is a breach of civil liberties, the fact that uninformed or random votes can skew election results and decrease civic engagement, and a poll showing that many Americans lack basic knowledge of the Constitution and may be voting based on intentional disinformation. Ultimately, these arguments suggest that compulsory voting should not be introduced."
"
This debate is on whether or not we should introduce compulsory voting. Supporters of the affirmative side argue that it will lead to greater representation, increased interest in politics, and fulfill a citizen's obligation to vote. Evidence supporting these claims includes the fact that compulsory voting will mean that candidates will have to address the needs of all the voters, leading to fairer representation. It will also increase the legitimacy of elected representatives, as they will be elected by the majority of the people. In countries like Thailand, voting is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution that citizens must exercise."
"
This debate is about whether we should legalize cannabis or not. The proponents argue that it has medical and therapeutic benefits and should therefore be made legal while the opponents argue that cannabis harms the body, increases lack-of-judgement/accidents, is a gateway-drug/addictive, can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children, and will boost the black-market/criminal activity. To support their argument, the opponents have presented evidence such as the fact that smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes, that there has been an increase in crash deaths involving cannabis and alcohol, a study that found early cannabis smokers were five times more likely to move on to harder drugs, and illegal cannabis busts in California. Overall, the opponents argue that we should not legalize cannabis."
"
The debate topic is 'We should legalize cannabis'. This debate is in favor of legalizing cannabis. It has been argued that legalizing cannabis is beneficial due to its comparative low level of health risk compared to other legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, its potential to provide financial savings, its possible medical and therapeutic applications, and its ability to reduce criminal activity and illicit drug use. Supporters also suggest that individuals should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies, as long as it does not cause harm to others. 

To support this argument, evidence has been presented that cannabis poses fewer health risks than certain legal drugs, and that its legalization could result in financial savings and a reduction in criminal activity. Further, it has been argued that individuals have the right to do whatever they want with their own bodies, so long as it does not cause harm to others. 

In conclusion, legalizing cannabis could provide a number of benefits, both economically and socially. Therefore, we should legalize cannabis."
"
In the debate on the topic 'We should legalize prostitution', it is argued that such legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, more immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking, and increase violence against women. It is also claimed that selling one's body is immoral. To back up these claims, evidence has been presented showing that in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population. Additionally, Maxwell (2000) and other researchers have found substantial evidence of a link between prostitution and drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes. Giobbe (1993) also found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence. Some feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client, thus reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client. 

To conclude, opponents of legalizing prostitution argue that this would lead to an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, immoral behaviour, violence against women, and would be immoral itself due to the power imbalance and exploitation it can involve. All of these arguments have been supported with evidence."
"
In the debate about whether we should legalize prostitution, the affirmative side takes the stance that legalizing prostitution would boost the economy, increase sex workers' benefits, allow for better regulation of the profession, make it safer for women, and be an empowering and valid choice for those in the profession. 

Evidence to support the affirmative stance includes the fact that one of Seattle's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, believed that prostitution could be a functional part of the economy; the Ministry of Justice of 2003 held a public discussion on legalizing prostitution as an official occupation; Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman acknowledged that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex; China launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan; and Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, holds that prostitution is not bad if done with consent."
"
This debate is on whether we should legalize sex selection. Proponents of this claim argue that it could provide a way for couples to plan their families and reduce gender discrimination. However, opponents argue that legalizing sex selection can lead to gender imbalance, reaffirm gender stereotypes/biases and create abortions/infanticide. Evidence shows that son preference has resulted in around 140 million women being ‘missing’ from society due to gender-biased sex selection. This form of discrimination has been found to have a damaging effect on societies. Additionally, opponents have expressed ethical and moral concerns over parents deliberately choosing the sex of their baby. It has also been found that sex-selective abortions were associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions. Thus, the evidence suggests that legalizing sex selection could have serious social, ethical and moral implications."
"
The debate is about whether we should legalize sex selection. Proponents of this view argue that it should be legalized because it is within the rights of parents to select the sex of their child, it allows for better family planning, makes the family happier and more complete, prevents diseases in the child, and will prevent abortions and infanticide. Evidence supporting these claims shows that it will enable couples to have an adequate number of children, gives parents effective control over the number of children they want, provides parents the opportunity to have the gender of their choice, gives them the chance to select embryos that do not have a genetic disorder, and finally, prevents the intentional killing of baby girls due to gender preference."
"
In this debate, we will be discussing whether we should prohibit flag burning. Opponents to this view argue that flag burning is an effective tool of expression, protest and critique, and is justified due to freedom of expression. The first claim is supported by evidence which states that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment and individuals have the right to make their speech as effective as possible. The second claim is also supported by evidence which states that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive. Thus, these claims are used to support the argument that flag burning should not be prohibited."
"
In this debate, we will discuss whether we should prohibit flag burning. The affirmative team stands in support of the idea that we should prohibit flag burning. Our first claim is that flags are important symbols that should be respected. This is evidenced by the fact that just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. This shows that the flag is an important symbol that should be respected and held to a higher standard. Our second claim is that flag burning is an inflammatory act. This is evidenced by the ordinance in Hong Kong, which states that a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration. Thus, it is clear that flag burning is an inflammatory act that should be prohibited."
"
Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', the opposition's stance is that women should be allowed to serve in combat as long as they pass the tests. Their argument consists of six main points and associated evidence to support the claim. The first point is that there should be equality between men and women in health, labor, and other areas. This is supported by evidence that fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and life expectancy for women is increasing in almost every country. Women are also engaging in economic activities beyond the home in countries of all income levels. The second point is that women are an asset in combat as warfare is changing to become more high-tech, making physical strength less important. The third point is that women can create unique skills and strategies. This is evidenced by the fact that in World War II, female snipers roamed the front lines and killed Germans with advanced telescopic rifles. The fourth point is that women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat as men. Evidence for this is provided by the creation of the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death in 1917, which was the first to go over the top and successfully seize a trench line. The fifth point is that women should be able to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. The sixth point is that women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests as having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly. Therefore, based on the argument and evidence provided, women should be allowed to serve in combat as long as they pass the tests."
"
This debate is on whether we should prohibit women in combat or not. The positive side of the debate claims that men are better suited for combat roles than women due to their physical differences. This is evidenced by the US Army's recent decision to consider reversing gender neutral physical tests because women were overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. Additionally, mixed gender teams in close combat roles could have far reaching and grave consequences, according to the Ministry of Defence. Furthermore, the Israeli Defence Force has said that less than 4 percent of women are in combat positions and that they are concentrated in combat-support. Finally, women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men, and as such are likely to be less consistent and dependable than their male counterparts in tough situations."
"
In the debate about whether we should subsidize journalism, the opponents argue that government intervention carries the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity, which is unacceptable, and it is preferable to spend the money elsewhere, given the current context of multiple forms of print, broadcast and digital communication. Furthermore, they state that journalism is just like any other business and should not be bailed out by the federal government as they are already facing financial difficulty. Overall, opponents to subsidizing journalism believe that the federal government should not interfere in the market and that journalism should face the same risks and consequences as any other business."
"
This debate is about whether we should subsidize journalism. The positive stance for this debate is that subsidies are necessary for the viability of journalism, it is important for information-spreading and accountability, it increases the quality of journalism, and it increases objectivity in reporting. Evidence provided in support of this argument includes that when news media lost a sizable percentage of their advertising revenues in the pandemic, state subsidies became more important than ever in securing the financial viability of media markets. Additionally, a 2011 report from the Oxford School for the Study of Journalism and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism stated that Mainstream media is the lifeblood of topical social media conversations in the UK. Furthermore, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents, thereby facilitating democratic decision-making. Finally, peace journalism can help to expose violent group's attempts to fix and naturalise meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence. In conclusion, we should subsidize journalism in order to ensure its financial viability, promote information-spreading and accountability, increase the quality of journalism, and increase objectivity in reporting."
"
The debate is about whether we should subsidize space exploration or not. Those opposing this idea have several points of argument. Firstly, they argue that space exploration can be carried out by the private sector. This is evidenced by the partnership between NASA and several for-profit companies, like Virgin Galactic and SpaceX. Secondly, space exploration is expensive and the money spent could be put to better use. Thirdly, it is ineffective, as it produces a large amount of pollution. Lastly, there are more important issues to fund than space exploration. Evidence for this is that the annual budget for NASA could provide 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, 1.87 million people with health care, or fund NASA for one year."
"
In this debate, we discuss the topic, “We should subsidize space exploration.” The supporters of this argument posit that space exploration can lead to colonizing the resources/lands of other planets, improve science and technology, be financially beneficial, necessary for the future survival of humanity, and unravel information about the universe. As evidence, it was stated that colonizing our solar system would need a broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties. Furthermore, space exploration after Gagarin’s 1961 flight, facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science. Satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040. We will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. Additionally, space exploration can lead to increasing knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity. Therefore, it is suggested that space exploration should be subsidized."
"
The debate topic is 'We should subsidize vocational education'. The affirmative side argues that subsidizing vocational education provides access to opportunities for the workforce, helps to fill in-demand roles in the economy, and leads to better outcomes for workers. The opponents of this idea argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes, is expensive, leads to an influx in those professions, and is not a good career choice. 

Evidence supporting the opponents' arguments includes a report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 which found that subsidizing vocational education may have limited benefits for the economy, as many programs may not provide the skills and knowledge that workers need to succeed in the 21st century; a study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 which found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be limited by the ability to scale, as many programs may not have the resources or infrastructure to serve large numbers of students; a study which analyzed the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany and found that the subsidies led to an increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs; and a report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 which found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience. 

In conclusion, there are legitimate arguments against subsidizing vocational education. However, proponents of vocational education believe that the benefits of subsidizing these programs outweigh the risks, as access to these programs helps to create a more diverse and skilled workforce, and ultimately helps to create better outcomes for workers."
"
The debate topic is 'We should subsidize vocational education'. The positive stance argues that subsidizing vocational education is beneficial in promoting economic mobility, in fitting the learning styles of many students, providing a quicker route to employment, and promoting workforce diversity. A study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education can increase economic mobility, particularly for individuals who may not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education or who face barriers to employment. Furthermore, a report by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that vocational education programs often offer customized learning experiences tailored to the individual needs and interests of students, which can better fit the learning styles of many students compared to traditional academic programs. Additionally, a report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that individuals with vocational education often have shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education. Finally, a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that vocational education programs can promote workforce diversity by providing training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by increasing the representation of diverse individuals in the workforce."
