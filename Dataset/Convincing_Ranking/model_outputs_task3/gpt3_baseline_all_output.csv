Topic: Assisted Suicide Should be a Criminal Offence
Stance: Opposing 

The opponents of the claim that assisted suicide should be a criminal offence are arguing that it gives the person dignity, reduces suffering, provides freedom of choice and allows the terminally ill to benefit. They point to the work of Dignity in Dying, an organisation which campaigns for the right of terminally ill, mentally competent adults to access an assisted death subject to strict rules and safeguards, as well as the findings of a qualitative study which showed the majority of people wanted to be able to choose a medically assisted death. Other evidence cited is the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee, which found the bill to be founded on the principle of personal autonomy, and the examples of Washington, Oregon and Canada, where court rulings and legislation have provided a legal framework for assisted dying. The opponents also point to the cases of terminally ill patients such as Jeanette Hall and Sir Terry Pratchett, who sought assistance in ending their lives before their illness got too severe. The arguments in favour of assisted suicide rely on the ethical, medical and legal considerations, such as autonomy and quality of life, which have been weighed up in jurisdictions which have legalised the practice."
"
The debate is on the topic of 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'. Those who argue for this stance provide evidence that assisted suicide can be used to solicit someone to die for their own benefit, that it should not be allowed as many people can still get better, that it violates the doctor's role, that people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others, and that people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. The evidence used to support the arguments include that the patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated' with a long-term history with the doctor, that physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent, that the organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, that the State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, that Dr. Lynda Young, MD, stated her opposition when she said, 'Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer', that assisted suicide is illegal in New Zealand, that in the cases of Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and that any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted of assisting suicide or attempting to do so, that in 1994, a suit was filed in New York claiming that the anti-assisted suicide statute was a violation of equal protection and liberty guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out, and that the Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others. It is clear that assisted suicide should be a criminal offence because it can be used to solicit someone to die for their own benefit, people can still get better, it violates the doctor's role, people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others, and people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help."
"
In summary, the topic of the debate is 'Homeschooling should be banned'. Opponents of this topic have presented five claims and their respective evidence to support these claims. Claim 1 asserts that homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students, which is supported by evidence such as Eastern York Schools and Lebanon School District providing special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services as well as a shift in public attitude towards home education from 1973 to 2001. Claim 2 argues that homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs, which is supported by evidence such as actor Ryan Gosling's positive experience with homeschooling, research showing mainstream schools failing to meet the requirements of special needs students, Sherry Bushnell and her husband's National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, and the opportunity to personalise the curriculum for the child's interests, needs, ability, and learning style. Claim 3 suggests that mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying, which is supported by John Holt's argument against schools as the answer to badness and the desire of parents to protect their children from violence, drugs and alcohol, and psychological abuse. Claim 4 states that parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children, which is supported by Franklin's views on public schools, the growing number of parents taking direct responsibility for their children's education, and the desire of parents to have a deeper understanding of their children's education progress and to give their children liberty to explore their own family's culture. Finally, Claim 5 claims that the home is a good learning environment, which is supported by research that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers, and the desire of parents to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give them “a more active learning environment.” Therefore, opponents of the motion 'Homeschooling should be banned' present a series of well-argued and well-persuaded claims and evidence to support their argument."
"
The debate material pertains to the topic of whether or not homeschooling should be banned. Those arguing in favor of the ban assert that homeschools cannot be regulated or standardized, that mainstream schools are essential for the development of social skills, that mainstream schools offer higher educational quality, and that parents are not qualified to serve as teachers. These claims are supported by evidence such as the contrasting forms of home education, the lack of regulation in some states that could lead to abuse, the importance of schools as a social safety net, the necessity of oversight to ensure a quality education, the experiences that homeschooled children miss out on, and the fact that parents must have the time and energy to devote to homeschooling in order to ensure a quality education. Those arguing against the ban state that homeschooling can be done effectively, and that parents should have the right to determine how to educate their children."
"
The debate topic is 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'. The proposition is that mandatory routine child vaccinations should be required to ensure children's health. The opponents of this proposition argue that routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous, contradict basic rights and are not necessary to keep children healthy. To support these claims, the opponents have provided evidence such as the CDC reporting that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, the manufacturer of Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, pulling the product from the market due to a higher instance of intussusception, the First Amendment of the US Constitution stating 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion', the interference with the human right of bodily integrity, and Mayo Clinic stating that natural infection often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations."
"
The topic of debate is whether 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'. This is a positive stance, arguing that they should be mandatory as routine child vaccinations are effective, saves lives, necessary to protect others and should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading, and to prevent children from suffering from preventable diseases. Evidence presented shows that two to three million deaths are prevented each year worldwide by vaccination, and an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if all recommended vaccines were used; in the twentieth century, 16,316 deaths from polio and 29,004 deaths from smallpox yearly in the United States compared to none in 2012; a 99% decrease in the rate of diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, and Hib because of vaccinations; a 500 cases of polio in 2014 compared to 350,000 cases in 1988; a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age; 33,000 lives and 14 million infections are saved when full vaccination is applied; vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year; childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018; a 74% decrease in childhood deaths from measles; a 92% rate of vaccination needed to prevent outbreaks of measles; and vaccination campaigns have eradicated smallpox and nearly eradicated polio, and Haemophilus influenzae infections have decreased by over 99%. In conclusion, routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent the suffering of children from preventable diseases, save lives, and protect others."
"
The debate is about whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. The opposition argues that social media regulation is ineffective, harms privacy, restricts freedom of speech and other democratic rights, and could lead to political abuses. They also point out that the government should not interfere in the affairs of private companies. Evidence supporting these claims includes findings from the Online Harms White Paper, the California Senate Bill No. 1001, the G.D.P.R. and research by the Open Rights Group, the Index on Censorship, the Department of Homeland Security, the Pew Research Center, and the UN Human Rights. Additionally, government intervention in the market system can be disruptive and it could be used for political purposes such as to suppress voting and political participation. Therefore, the opponents conclude that social media regulation by the government should not be enforced."
"
The topic of the debate is: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government'. Proponents of this stance believe that the government should take measures to regulate social media, as it would help to protect younger audiences, tackle the issue of fake news, benefit society as a whole, and deal with negative content and malicious users. To protect younger audiences, the DCMS announced the Bill would be strengthened so that all providers who published or placed pornographic content on their services would need to prevent children from accessing that content, and EPIC and coalition of child advocacy, consumer, and privacy groups have filed a complaint to the FTC to investigate and penalize TikTok for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. To deal with fake news, the European Union reached a deal to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content, and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. To benefit society, legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) seek to make social media platforms more transparent and outlaw so-called dark patterns. To deal with negative content, the National Science Foundation is attempting to identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material. And to deal with malicious users, companies are cracking down on flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda, and other illegal material."
"
In summary, the opponents of the claim that the US is a good country to live in present a series of arguments that outline the negative aspects of living in the US. These claims include unfair health and education policies, a problematic and divisive political system, a negative culture, high taxation and costs of living, inequality and poverty, and a high rate of gun violence and racism. Evidence to support these claims includes, for example, reports of difficulty affording health care costs among lower-income adults and Black and Hispanic adults, an increase in the number of Americans who feel the country is now more divided than before the outbreak, and the US's high rate of gun violence and its history of deportations and racial discrimination. These claims present an argument that the US is not a good country to live in."
"
Summarizing the debate material: The USA is a good country to live in because of its strong economy, high standard of living, world-class health and education systems, beautiful environment and nature, rich culture, democratic rights, and powerful position. It also offers great opportunities for individuals in terms of employment, internships, and career opportunities. Evidence supporting these claims includes the high per capita income, the leading role in medical research and innovation, and the impressive job growth over the last few months."
"
The debate material is discussing the stance that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned. Those in opposition to this argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, it is a strong religious belief, it makes the priests to be perceived as holy, priests choose to be celibates, religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, and removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts. Evidence for each of the claims includes:  Evidence 1: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it; Evidence 2: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God; Evidence 3: Garry Wills argues that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church; Evidence 4: Supporters of clerical celibacy answer that God only calls men to the priesthood if they are capable; Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God; Evidence 6: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem'; Evidence 7: Sacerdotalis caelibatus is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI; Evidence 8: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law; Evidence 9: Supporters of celibacy claim that Roman Catholic priests suffering sexual temptations are not likely to turn immediately to a teenage boy; Evidence 10: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest; Evidence 11: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift; Evidence 12: Theresia, Sr. Agnes, Sr. Elisabeth and Sr. Klara took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty; Evidence 13: Philippe Delhaye wrote that during the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage; Evidence 14: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church; Evidence 15: Among the early Church statements on the topic of sexual continence and celibacy are the Directa and Cum in unum decretals of Pope Siricius; Evidence 16: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy; Evidence 17: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition; Evidence 18: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church; Evidence 19: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals. These are the main arguments for why the vow of celibacy should be maintained, which are supported by evidence, and should be taken into consideration when deciding whether or not the vow should be abandoned."
"
Summarized Argument: The topic for debate is the abandonment of the vow of celibacy. Positive supporters argue that celibacy is outdated, too pressuring/difficult, unhealthy/unnatural, and leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Historical evidence shows that celibacy is an optional practice, rather than required dogma, and the discussion to make it optional has been open for debate since 2009. It is also argued that celibacy brings out horrible things in people and leads to loneliness, depression, and unhealthy behaviour. It is further argued that it reduces the number of people wanting to become priests and violates Biblical teachings."
"
In summary, the debate over whether we should abandon marriage focuses on five claims: Marriage benefits children, it is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons, it makes people happy, it makes couples closer, and it provides important financial benefits. Opponents of abandoning marriage offer evidence to support their claims, such as studies showing that children from married families tend to have higher reading scores and are more likely to attend college, that marriage is more than a physical union and mirrors the love between God and His Church, and that marriage creates a tax advantage for couples and is free from inheritance tax when one partner dies."
"
In summary, the topic being discussed is whether we should abandon marriage. Supporters of this point of view argue that marriage preserves harmful norms for women, is often unstable, ties people up with unfair obligations, and that most of its advantages can be achieved through monogamous relationships. Evidence to support these claims includes that one in three girls in Zimbabwe are married by their eighteenth birthday due to discriminatory norms, Paul Dolan's findings that unmarried women tend to be happier, healthier, and live longer, that women initiate most divorces due to negative effects of marriage, that money and children can cause stress in marriage, that divorce rates are increasing globally and in the US due to expectations changing, that in Qatar women must have permission from their husbands to work or travel, and that intimacy and emotional stability can be found through monogamy."
"
Summary: The debate is about whether we should abandon the use of school uniform or not. Its opponents argue that children can still express themselves using other means, that school uniform reduces bullying, creates a sense of equality/unity, encourages discipline or focus on learning, and saves costs. Evidence supporting these claims include a former student's opinion that uniforms do not stop students from being themselves, statistics showing that schools with strict uniform policies experience fewer bullying incidents, a survey showing that 83% of teachers believed that uniforms can prevent bullying, and research showing that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel."
"
In summary, school uniform has been a hotly debated issue for many years. The proponents of abandoning the use of school uniform present a number of arguments against it. They argue that school uniform harms learning and creativity, stifles self-expression, is expensive, often uncomfortable and sexist, and increases conformity, or harms individuality. Examples include the false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same, school uniforms send messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, and that forcing teenagers to wear uniforms may lead to them resenting it. They also cite evidence that money is not actually saved, 95% of parents think school uniforms cost too much, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment, and it may lead to situations of comparison between students. Finally, they point to the fact that uniforms can be restrictive for girls, and that wearing them delays an adolescent's transition into adulthood."
"
In this debate, the opponents of abolishing capital punishment present various arguments that show that it has benefits in providing closure for victims’ families and justice for heinous crimes. This is backed by evidence from Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), and Prime Minister Tony Blair, who stated that they are against the death penalty but accept it in cases of severe crimes, which are described as extrajudicial killings and crimes against humanity by the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. The opponents also argue that the death penalty can help prevent crimes, which is supported by evidence from Bolte, Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, and David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, who argue that it is the most effective way of deterring criminals from committing heinous crimes, as well as Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, who have provided a study that shows executions have a strong deterrent effect."
"
This debate is centered around the topic 'We should abolish capital punishment.' The affirmative stance of this debate is that capital punishment should be abolished due to its ineffectiveness as a deterrence, its irreversible nature, and its disproportional impact on the disenfranchised. Evidence has shown that the death penalty has been proven to be the ultimate, irrevocable denial of human rights, with the risk of executing an innocent person never being able to be eliminated. Furthermore, polls have indicated that capital punishment does not prevent crime and it has been found that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it. Additionally, the death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and its cost for defense is much higher than that of non-death penalty cases, and this diverts resources from other important cases. Finally, it is argued that fear of the death penalty does not cause a substantial amount of people to hesitate from committing murder, since persons who commit or contemplate such crimes do not often plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Thus, given the irreversible and ineffectual nature of capital punishment, it should be abolished."
"
Summary: The debate topic of 'We should abolish intellectual property rights' is being argued from both sides. Opponents of this stance point out that intellectual property rights incentivize creativity and innovation, investment in developing new products, and protect against stealing. Supporters point out that people, or businesses, should be able to be compensated for their innovations and should be able to benefit from the property they have created. Evidence has been provided to support both sides, such as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), which states that effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries. Other evidence such as Operation In Our Sites, initiated by the NIPRCC, has been provided to show that without intellectual property protections, such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced."
"
The debate material is on the topic 'We should abolish intellectual property rights'. The supporters of this position argue that intellectual property rights prevent the continuous improvement of a service/product, restrict access to important information/products, are unfair, harm creativity/innovation, waste money and are ineffective. Evidence is provided to support each claim, such as in the case of restricting access, users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable themselves and Professor Lessig's analysis of the tension between the concepts of piracy and property in the intellectual property realm. Additionally, evidence is provided to support that intellectual property harms creativity/innovation, such as Petra Moser's assertion that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation and Richard Stallman's argument that the term intellectual property is designed to confuse people. Lastly, evidence is provided to show that intellectual property rights waste money, such as Bhagwati's claim that the WTO's agenda was forced onto it by the pharmaceutical and software industries, and Boldrin and Levine's argument that monopoly creates many social costs."
"
The debate over whether the right to keep and bear arms should be abolished is a contentious one, with proponents arguing that gun control is ineffective, gun ownership is a right protected by the Second Amendment to the Constitution, gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sport-shooting, and gun ownership promotes self protection. Opponents counter that, according to a 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, only 10.1% of criminals obtain their firearms through a retail source, a 2018 study found that comprehensive background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California, and a study in Applied Economics Letters found that ""assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level"". Additionally, in 2010 the Court strengthened Second Amendment protections in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 567 F.3d 856, and in 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. Furthermore, according to a Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting. Additionally, a May 9, 2013 survey found that 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun. Finally, a Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. Ultimately, the right to keep and bear arms is a right that is both protected by the US Constitution and is seen as essential to personal safety and hunting/sport shooting, making abolishing the right difficult to achieve."
"
In conclusion, The right to keep and bear arms should be abolished. Evidence supports this stance by showing that banning guns would save lives, gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence, guns can fall into the wrong hands, and guns lead to accidental deaths. For instance, in 2015, assaults with a firearm were 6.8 times more common in states that had the most guns, compared to the least, and data from Harvard School of Public Health shows that states with higher gun ownership levels have higher rates of homicide. Moreover, a June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand.” A Secret Service analysis of 24 mass shootings in 2019 revealed that at least 10 (42%) involved illegally possessed guns, and a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report found that 37.4% of state prison inmates obtained the gun from a family member or friend. Accidental gun deaths, particularly to those under 25 years old, are a real issue, as 209 children have already died by gunshot in 2022 alone. Therefore, it is clear that abolishing the right to keep and bear arms would be beneficial in terms of saving lives and reducing gun violence."

Topic: We should adopt an austerity regime

The debate surrounding the topic of whether we should adopt an austerity regime is one that is sure to continue for a long time. One of the main opponents of the austerity regime is that it cuts access to essential services, resulting in an increase in poverty and an increase in reliance on charities for food and other basic needs. Additionally, austerity policies have been known to extend economic recessions, and can lead to an increase in inequality, as the benefits of lower interest rates tend to disproportionately benefit large corporations, and not the average consumer. Furthermore, austerity policies lead to a decrease in growth and job creation, furthering exacerbating the economic and social issues that are already prevalent."
"
Topic: We should adopt an austerity regime. 

The supporters of the austerity regime argue that it is essential for improving economic measures, long-term performance, stability, and for reducing budget deficits or paying debts. Evidence such as Latvia showing fast growth of 5.1% in the past 12 months at Q1 2012, a rise in bond yields in the cases of Greece, Spain and Ireland, a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation in Greece, Alberto Alesina's research showing the benefits of expansionary austerity, falling deficits in Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden, Morocco's economic stability, steady growth and low inflation rates, and the US's successful implementation of the austerity measures in the 1920s all support the claim that austerity is important."
"
The debate topic is 'We should adopt atheism'. Its opponents argue that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion, lacks morality, and people should choose for themselves whether to adopt it. As Evidence 1, John Locke argued that the denial of God's existence would lead to chaos, and Evidence 4 states that the Albanian Constitution of 1976 imposed prison sentences for religious propaganda. Evidence 1 from Douglas Wilson states that belief in God is necessary for morality, and Evidence 3 from the European Court of Human Rights states that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. Finally, Evidence 3 from the Freedom to Manifest One's Religion or Beliefs states that people should be free to choose for themselves whether to adopt atheism. Therefore, it can be concluded that while atheism does have its opponents, people should be free to choose for themselves whether or not to adopt it."
"
In conclusion, the debate presented the topic of 'We should adopt atheism' which was supported by arguments that atheism is beneficial to those who adopt it, as it provides freedom from conflicting ideologies and no need to blindly follow religious doctrines. It was also argued that atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists, as there is no evidence to do so and it is irrational to believe in something not observable. It was further argued that religions are immoral and should not be followed, as they can lead to people being obedient rather than moral, and they can encourage violence. Lastly, it was argued that science can adequately explain the Universe and atheism can offer intellectual fulfilment to those who accept it."
"
In conclusion, the debate is about whether we should adopt libertarianism as an ideology. Proponents of libertarianism argue that it promotes individual freedom and economic growth. However, opponents argue that libertarianism harms economic growth, minorities, and is unjust and non-equal. They also argue that it removes essential laws and infrastructure and that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens. Evidence presented to support these claims included examples of market failures, the morality of requiring the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, and the importance of government action to protect the environment and human rights."
"
In summary, supporters of libertarianism argue that it should be adopted because it increases economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfilment, and individual freedom/liberties. In terms of economic growth, it is argued that elements of libertarianism and green politics can be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits, free-market roads are safer, more efficient, and more cost-effective, and reduced taxation leads to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity. For political freedom, it is argued that by limiting the role of government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests, that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems, and that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. As for happiness/fulfilment, it is argued that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests, and that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. Finally, with regards to individual freedom/liberties, it is argued that individuals are better able to make their own decisions, that protection of property rights is essential, and that freedom of speech and expression are crucial for protecting individual freedom."
"
The debate topic is 'We should ban human cloning.' Opponents of this argument argue that human cloning can be used for organ replication, helping those who can't otherwise have a child, promoting health and science/research. Evidence supporting these claims includes studies from various medical and scientific journals that demonstrate the potential benefits of cloning, such as reducing the risk of organ rejection, slowing the progression of certain diseases, and helping to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. In addition, cloning can be used to study the development of embryos, create genetically modified organisms, and study the genetic makeup of extinct species. All of these benefits demonstrate the potential of human cloning, making it difficult to justify a ban."
"
Summary:
The debate revolves around the topic of whether we should ban human cloning or not. Supporters of the ban argue that cloning is not understood enough yet, is unethical/anti-religious, unnatural and unsafe. Evidence supporting this argument includes Richard Kass' article ""The Wisdom of Repugnance"" which states that modern ethical discourse fails to provide moral guidance and that cloning could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters; the United Nations General Assembly, the Danish Council of Ethics, and UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights all condemning the reproductive cloning of humans; Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist, arguing that cloning goes against human dignity; and various studies showing that cloning can result in genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, and unintended health problems."
"
The topic of this debate is 'We should ban private military companies'. The stance of the opponents is that private military companies should not be banned because they are financially beneficial, better trained and equipped, can supplement regular armies, and increase safety. In support of this stance, evidence has been provided that private military companies can result in cost savings compared to traditional military personnel due to their ability to quickly respond to changing circumstances and provide access to specialized skills and expertise. Furthermore, private military companies typically require their personnel to have high levels of training and experience, often exceeding the requirements for traditional military personnel. They can also provide support services, such as logistics and communications, and carry out sensitive missions such as covert operations, freeing up regular army personnel to focus on other tasks. Private military companies also often invest in advanced technology, allowing them to carry out their operations with greater safety and effectiveness. All these reasons suggest that private military companies should not be banned."
"
Given the topic: 'We should ban private military companies', its positive supporters argue that private military companies are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes, are not professional, cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country, prioritize profit, and solicit engaging, or prolonging, conflict. Evidence supporting these claims include reports by the Project on Government Oversight, Amnesty International, the Congressional Research Service, the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, and the International Peace Institute. These reports have found evidence of criminal activities committed by private military companies, the lack of accountability leading to actions that violate human rights and commit crimes, unlawful killings, using child soldiers, a conflict of interest leading to ethical violations, limited accountability making it difficult to hold them responsible, the chain of command for private military companies being unclear, limited transparency making it difficult to monitor their actions and ensure professional conduct, the hiring of poorly trained personnel, private military companies prioritizing their contractual obligations to their clients, a conflict of interest when serving both their client and the broader interests of society, the lack of transparency leading to actions that are not in the best interest of the hiring country, private military companies often prioritizing profit over other considerations, the high cost of private military services incentivizing companies to prioritize profit, private military companies having a financial incentive to prolong conflicts, offering services to clients who seek to engage in conflict, profiting from war, and the presence of private military companies increasing the militarization of conflicts."
"
In a debate over the topic 'We should ban the use of child actors', the opponent argues that acting may be the child's dream, and that child performers can achieve success and confidence. They also point out that some roles can only be performed by children, and suggest that child performers should not be banned as long as there is adequate supervision and regulation. Finally, they argue that the decision should be left to the parents as they are the primary source of values for children and best equipped to make decisions for their well-being. To support this argument, research from a variety of sources has been presented, including the Journal of Youth and Adolescence, the Journal of Popular Culture, the Drama Teachers Association of America, the American Psychological Association, the Screen Actors Guild, the National Association of Theatre Owners, the Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism, the Actors Equity Association, the Journal of Media Psychology, the Heritage Foundation, the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, the United Nations, the Journal of Family Psychology, and the American Academy of Pediatrics."
"
The debate topic is 'We should ban the use of child actors'. It is argued that this should be done as it can harm their education, lead to exploitation, and a loss of childhood, all of which can have a detrimental effect on the performer's life later in adulthood. To support these claims, evidence such as the American Academy of Pediatrics 2009 report, which found that child performers may experience developmental delays and emotional difficulties, as well as a study published in the Journal of Adolescence in 2012 which found that they may be subject to labor violations, physical abuse, and sexual exploitation, was cited. It was further suggested that child performers often experience high levels of pressure and stress which can lead to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. The career of a child actor can also create a lack of identity, especially when transitioning to adulthood, which can be devastating. For these reasons, it is clear why we should ban the use of child actors."

Summary:
The debate is about whether we should close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Opponents of this motion argue that closing the camp would harm national security, given that there are 80 hardened and unrepentant terrorists among the detainees, and 17.5% of all detainees have been confirmed to re-engage in terrorism or insurgency. Moreover, Guantanamo Bay is a secure location and provides better treatment and medical care than most other maximum-security prisons in the world. Lastly, it is an important intelligence asset and is the single greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror. Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility."
"
Summary: The topic of this debate is whether the United States should close its Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Supporters of this argument cite evidence from the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that detainees held at the camp have the right to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts. Supporters further argue that the detention camp has harmed the U.S. image, reputation, and institutions, and has become a symbol of discrimination and injustice. It has also been proven to be a costly endeavor, with costs ranging from $6 billion to $13 million per prisoner. Lastly, the use of torture and unjust tactics on detainees, such as sexual humiliation, water boarding, and cruel isolation, have been reported, further damaging the reputation of the United States as a global leader on human rights."
"
The debate is about the topic 'We should end affirmative action'. The stance for this debate is that affirmative action should not be ended, since it helps to boost diversity, compensate for the past and reduce discrimination. Evidence for this position includes Ed Wingenbach's assertion that affirmative action is important for access to power in persistently White institutions, UC's improved admissions record for minority students since 1997, the refutation of Sander's paper on mismatching, the Supreme Court rulings Grutter v Bollinger and Gratz v Bollinger that upheld the importance of diversity, and the submission of the APALC to the Supreme Court in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin that Asian students benefit from exposure to a diverse student body. Evidence to show that affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past includes Elkins' views from the late 1960s, the Houston Chronicle's opinion column about academically unqualified minority students, Wesolowski's 2001 statement that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals, and Roger Wilkins' observation about the 375-year history of Blacks on the continent, which includes 245 years of slavery and 100 years of legalized discrimination. Furthermore, evidence that affirmative action reduces discrimination includes the range of goals to bridge inequalities in employment and pay, increase access to education, enrich state and institutional leadership, and redress apparent past wrongs, such as Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987) upholding a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance'."
"
This debate is about whether we should end affirmative action or not. Supporters of ending affirmative action argue that it diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Evidence supporting these claims includes examples from Arizona voters who passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107, privileged African Americans gaining professional upward mobility through affirmative action and equal opportunity sanctions in education and employment, stifling the ability of minority groups to advance in society, devaluing the accomplishments of people who are chosen based on the social group to which they belong rather than their qualifications, Harvard University capping the number of admissions for Asian American students and marking them down on “personality trait” testing, affirmative action focusing on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities, affirmative action being a shallow solution to a much deeper issue, and BIPOC students not being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in college due to affirmative action. Opponents of affirmative action, such as the Supreme Court in Sweden, also claim that it is a form of reverse discrimination and George Hardin claims it is a form of racism. All of this evidence proves that affirmative action should be ended."
"
Topic: We should end mandatory retirement.
Stance: Opponents
Summary: Opponents of ending mandatory retirement argue that a mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers by freeing up job openings for younger workers and promoting intergenerational equity. They also argue that mandatory retirement ages can increase financial security for workers, as they can receive pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a specified age. Evidence to support this argument includes a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2010, a report by the International Labour Organization in 2012, a study by the World Economic Forum in 2016, a study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019, and a report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in 2010."
"
In summary, the debate is about the pros and cons of having a mandatory retirement age. The positive side argues that a mandatory retirement age decreases institutional knowledge, harms the economy, is unfair and discriminatory, reduces the quality of life of those forced to retire, and should be replaced with the ability to retire when ready. Supporting this argument are a number of evidence, such as the fact that there is no mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers in the UK, or the reports by OECD, ILO, World Economic Forum and Government Accountability Office that highlight the economic implications of mandatory retirement ages. Furthermore, the American Association of Retired Persons and Harvard Business Review have reported the potential age discrimination and decreased sense of purpose, respectively, while the World Health Organization, National Bureau of Economic Research and International Labour Organization have all found that allowing people to retire when ready can promote well-being, increase financial security, maintain skills and experience, and reduce the risk of poverty in old age."
"
Summary:
The opponents of the proposition that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. To support this claim, they provide evidence that deterrence is a strategy that has been successful in maintaining peace for almost 70 years, and that the invasion of Ukraine did not signify the failure of nuclear deterrence, as Ukraine was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. This evidence suggests that possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia have served as a boundary for conflict between them, ensuring that the West does not intervene in Ukraine and Moscow keeps their territory safe."
"
The topic of the debate is 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons.' The stance is in support of this statement, arguing that nuclear weapons should be abolished due to the risks of them falling into the wrong hands, as well as the potential to escalate to disastrous military action. Evidence supporting this stance includes Deepti Choubey's statement that there are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that could be used by terrorists, as well as Jonathan Herbach's warning that nuclear materials are not going away and more states are interested in developing them. Additionally, the threat of nuclear terrorism posed by ISIS and the risk of accidents, errors, irresponsible leadership, and hackers can lead to the use of nuclear weapons are all valid points. Ariel Conn's point that the threat of nuclear warfare is never the top priority further emphasizes the risk posed by nuclear weapons, as well as Max Tegmark and David Stanley's simulation of a nuclear attack that would cause 91 million casualties and the terrifying incident of lost contact with 50 missiles, respectively. Finally, Anthony Aguirre's reminder of the constellation of incidents surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis highlights how quickly tensions can escalate, and how lucky we were to survive the crisis. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that nuclear weapons should be abolished in order to minimize the risk of a devastating attack or terrorist activity."
"
The debate topic is ""We should fight urbanization"" and its opponents argue that cities offer more opportunities, urbanization benefits the economy, and urbanization benefits the environment. In support of this stance, evidence suggests that deficient urban planning, a potential for job creation, investment opportunities, and industrialization are all benefits of urbanization. Moreover, a study conducted by Bates and Bennett concluded that rural communities with other viable investment opportunities had lower rates of rural-urban migration. Furthermore, cities can lead to economic growth and provide greater efficiency of agriculture, and technological development which in turn reduces the ecological footprint. Finally, biodiversity can be improved through urbanization as well as environment-friendly equipment and machines that will create a green economy."
"
Summary:
The topic of the debate is 'We should fight urbanization'. Supporters of the positive side argue that restrictions on migration would benefit people in rural areas economically and socially, urbanization causes crime, harms the environment, and is causing a strain on cities' resources. Evidence for this includes Venezuela's rural areas seeing economic disinvestment and governmental neglect due to oil wealth being discovered; protection of natural resources eliminates the causes of rural to urban migration in India; a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems in New Zealand; increased criminal activities in Bopal and Ghuma; urbanization contributing to coastal waters being polluted; and urbanization creating slums in cities due to local governments not being able to manage urbanization."
"
Given the topic of whether or not we should introduce compulsory voting, those opposing it have presented four arguments. The first argument is that abstention from voting is a form of expressing one's preference, and is a way to exercise one's right to vote. The second argument is that citizens have a right not to vote, and that compulsory voting is a breach of civil liberties. The third argument is that compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, which leads to the influence of money and spending on political campaigns. The fourth argument is that not everyone has the ability to go to vote due to a lack of knowledge or resources. Evidence has been provided for each of these claims, suggesting that compulsory voting is not necessarily a good idea."
"
In this debate, the topic being discussed is whether we should introduce compulsory voting. The positive side of this argument is in favour of introducing compulsory voting, based on three claims. The first claim is that compulsory voting increases representation, which is supported by evidence showing that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement, and increases electoral support for leftist policy positions. Additionally, it ensures that candidates have to address the needs of all voters, instead of skewing the political system towards the wealthy and well-educated. The second claim is that compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics, and evidence from the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory support this claim. The third claim is that people have an obligation to vote, which is supported by evidence from the European Court of Human Rights ruling that only attendance at a polling station is compulsory, and the fact that voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory. 

Overall, this debate concludes that introducing compulsory voting is a positive step that would lead to increased representation, political education and civic engagement."
"
This debate is about whether we should legalize cannabis. The stance of those who oppose cannabis legalization is that cannabis harms the body, increases lack-of-judgement and accidents, is a gateway drug that leads to addiction, is easily accessed by children, and will boost the black-market and criminal activity. Evidence to support their stance includes a Dutch study showing increased THC content increases impaired psychomotor skills, a National Institutes of Health study in Baltimore finding heavy, chronic cannabis smoking changes blood proteins linked to heart disease, a British Lung Foundation study finding smoking three cannabis joints causes the same damage as 20 cigarettes, Anslinger claiming cannabis causes people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally, a meta-analysis finding cannabis increases the risk of an automobile crash, a study published in the American Journal of Public Health finding that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol have more than doubled, a study by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden where teenage rats given THC took larger doses of heroin, and a study with 311 same sex twins showing those who smoked cannabis before age 17 were five times more likely to move on to harder drugs. Finally, evidence for their stance includes the Monitoring the Future Survey finding that 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain, Alaska's experiment with legalization leading to teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths, and California's recent massive illegal cannabis busts."
"
The debate topic is 'We should legalize cannabis' and the stance is that it should be legalized. The first claim is that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal, which is supported by evidence such as a 2002 DAWN report, a 2001 New Mexico Drug Policy Advisory Group report, the statements of psychopharmacologist David Nutt and an argument that making cannabis legally available would reduce crime by shrinking the illicit market and by potentially reducing alcohol consumption. The second claim is that cannabis is financially beneficial, supported by evidence such as the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit report, a Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya report, and an argument that the removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act could save billions and generate billions in tax revenues. The third claim is that cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief, supported by evidence such as a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine's findings, and a letter from congressmen to the FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach. The fourth claim is that if cannabis was legalized it could be regulated, supported by evidence such as British Crime Survey statistics and an explanation of how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control from Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel. The fifth claim is that legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity, supported by evidence such as a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Connecticut Law Revision Commission, and the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime. The sixth claim is that people should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies, which is supported by the philosophy of John Stuart Mill, who argued that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society. 

Overall, this debate material argues that legalizing cannabis should be considered for a variety of reasons, such as the fact that alcohol and tobacco, which are more harmful than cannabis, remain legal, and that cannabis is financially beneficial and provides health and pain relief benefits. Additionally, legalizing cannabis could help reduce black-market/criminal activity and allow individuals to do whatever they want to their own bodies."
"
The topic of the debate is ""We should legalize prostitution"". The stance taken in the debate is against the legalization of prostitution, as its opponents are providing arguments and evidence to prove why prostitution should not be legalized. 

One of the arguments presented against the legalization of prostitution is that it will lead to an increase in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. This is supported by Evidence 1 which states that a survey in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; and by Evidence 2 which states that in Africa, encounters with prostitutes produce 84% of new HIV infections in adult males. Moreover, Evidence 3 states that registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes; and Evidence 4 states that some studies of prostitution in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population. 

The second argument is that legalizing prostitution will lead to an increase in immoral behaviour such as pimping, organized crime and trafficking. This is supported by Evidence 1 which states that the legalisation of prostitution will result in an increase in human trafficking and crime; and by Evidence 2 which states that many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps, and Evidence 3 which states that the United Nations reported that 79% of human trafficking is for prostitution. Moreover, Evidence 4 states that in the Netherlands, two Labour Party councillors found that a large number of prostitutes were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs; and Evidence 5 states that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime.

The third argument is that legalizing prostitution will lead to an increase in violence against women. This is supported by Evidence 1 which states that physical violence against prostitutes is extremely high, particularly among female sex workers; and by Evidence 2 which states that in a study of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, 70% of them had traumatizing experiences of physical violence, 40% of which were involved in prostitution; and by Evidence 3 which states that a survey of female sex workers in Leeds, England, and Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland, revealed that 47% had been victims of crime, including rape and robbery, while 36% had received threatening texts, telephone calls or emails. Additionally, Evidence 4 states that 11% had been raped and 22% had experienced an attempted rape; and Evidence 5 states that research has found substantial evidence that there is a correlation between pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence.

Finally, the fourth argument is that selling one's body is immoral. This is supported by Evidence 1 which states that some feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client, putting her in a subordinate position."
"
Debate Summary:
The topic of this debate is 'We should legalize prostitution'. Supporters of the topic argue that legalizing prostitution would boost the economy, increase sex workers' benefits, allow the profession to be regulated, make it safer for women, and give them the right to choose their bodies. Examples of evidence include a court ruling in Amsterdam, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard in Seattle, The World Charter for Prostitutes Rights, Alexandra Oliveira's ethnographical research, The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour, a study from 1995 in two brothels, and Mariska Majoor's views. Decriminalizing sex work would also grant the same rights to sex workers as other self-employed people, provide them with social benefits, and help to make prostitution safer for all involved. All in all, legalizing prostitution would offer sex workers increased rights and safety, and reduce social stigma."
"
Given the topic 'We should legalize sex selection', opponents argue that sex selection can lead to gender imbalance, reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases and can create abortions/infanticide. Evidence in support of these claims shows that bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society. This gender imbalance can lead to social unrest and wars, as well as discriminatory behaviour against women in countries such as China and India. There, sex selection has led to a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio and a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences. Evidence also shows that son preference has resulted in neglect of girls and in some cases female infanticide, as well as sex-selective abortions. Opponents argue that sex selection should not be legalized due to its ethical and moral implications and its potential for reinforcing gender biases and stereotypes."
"
Summary: The debate topic is whether we should legalize sex selection, with positive supporters arguing that it is within the parents' freedom to select the sex of the child, it allows for better family planning, makes the family more happy and complete, and prevents diseases in the child as well as abortions or infanticide. Evidence presented includes that it helps fulfill the wishes of a desired gender, allows for smart shopping, can prevent gender-specific diseases from being passed onto a baby, provides the opportunity of raising the desired number of children, gives parents effective control over the number of children they want, and can prevent infanticide and abortions due to the preference for a certain gender."
"
The debate topic is 'We should prohibit flag burning'. Those opposed to this stance argue that flag burning is an effective tool of expression and protest, and is justified due to the freedom of expression as granted in the First Amendment of the US Constitution. This was supported by the US Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in 1989 in favor of Gregory Johnson, who was charged with desecrating an American flag. The court found that Johnson's act of burning the flag was protected speech under the First Amendment, and the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, it can be argued that prohibiting flag burning would go against the right to freedom of expression."
"
In the given debate, the topic is 'We should prohibit flag burning'. The positive supporters of the claim believe that flags are important symbols that should be respected and that flag burning is an inflammatory act. To support the claim, they provide evidence such as Chief Justice Warren's opinion that First Amendment does not protect all things labeled 'symbolic speech', the 1983 Turkish flag law and the 2003 incident of Khalid leading a protest march and burning the American flag, which are all examples of flag desecration being considered an offensive gesture. In addition, the ordinance in Hong Kong prohibits using flags in advertisements or trademarks and publicly burning them. It is clear that prohibiting flag burning is necessary to protect the sanctity of national flags."
"
This debate addresses the topic of prohibiting women in combat. The opponents of this stance argue that women should be allowed in combat due to gender equality, women's impact on the economy, their skills in combat, unique strategies, capabilities in combat, and the ability to pass tests. They also point out that allowing women in combat has been seen to be beneficial for unit cohesion, security risks, discipline, and efficiency. With evidence from a variety of studies, wars, and organizations, it is clear that allowing women to choose to serve in combat is a necessary move in order to have the best possible forces for the job."
"
The debate is about whether women should be allowed to serve in combat roles. Proponents of this stance argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women due to their greater physical strength and ability to sustain physical fitness. This is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine and a yearlong Marine Corps study which found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units. Additionally, women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers which combat roles require. Women are also prone to distractions which can impact the functioning of the military, and lowering of physical standards to allow women in combat roles could damage the quality of the military. Instead, it is argued that women should serve in safer roles such as those in the Second World War which included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics, and nurses. Women should also be excluded from combat roles due to the warrior culture among men which equates women with weakness, and the risk of capture which may be accompanied by rape."
"
In a debate about whether the government should subsidize journalism, the opponents argue that government intervention has the risk of inserting bias/harming objectivity (Evidence 1: Increased governmental controlling of journalists' media access freedom of expression can lead to the need of finding new and less controlled ways of expression; Evidence 2: The Public Journalism Network explains that journalism and democracy work best when news, information and ideas flow freely; Evidence 4: Political endorsements create more opportunities to construe favoritism in reporting, and can create a perceived conflict of interest; Evidence 5: It’s just wrong. If government funds, government will regulate. Freedom of the press has to include freedom for the press to fail), it is preferable to spend the money elsewhere (Evidence 1: Postal subsidies from our nation’s early founding are irrelevant. We had one communication medium then, newspapers. In today’s world of multiple forms of print, broadcast and digital communication, federal subsidies would decide winners and losers, protecting inefficient companies and creating huge obstacles for entrepreneurs) and journalism is like every other business and if it is not sustainable it should fail (Evidence 1: The federal government can’t afford to bail out newspapers. The taxpayers can’t afford to bail out undeserving media companies and journalism can’t afford to be dependent on a debt-burdened government). The opponents of subsidizing journalism cite Evidence that increased government control of media access and freedom of expression leads to reduced objectivity, point out that it is preferable to spend the money elsewhere, and argue that journalism should fail if it is not sustainable like any other business."
"
In the debate about whether we should subsidize journalism, its supporters argue that a subsidy is necessary to make it viable, to spread information and accountability, to increase the quality of journalism, and to increase objectivity in reporting. Evidence presented to support this includes a 1996 European Court of Human Rights ruling that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom. It has become increasingly difficult to find reliable information amongst the massive amount of digital journalism available. According to a Zogby International survey, 70% of Americans consider journalism important to maintaining community quality of life, while 67% think traditional media are out of touch. The Associated Press is an example of an efficient, factual reporting source that editors can use. A 1975 Trilateral Commission study found that the media had become an important source of national power, suggesting the development of television journalism had weakened governmental authority. Solutions journalism can present citizens with a more complete view of issues and may help to increase the impact of investigative reporting. Journalism education can help to empower members of the public and the UK mainstream media is still important in topical social media conversations. Subsidies can also help to promote quality journalism, such as the IFJ's Ethical Journalism Initiative, and to improve economic literacy in the media. They can also help to promote a media-plural Europe, where different ideas, opinions and debates are presented to voters, especially in the era of fake news. Finally, peace journalism can help to expose attempts to fix and naturalise violent meaning by presenting anomalous local perspectives."
"

The topic for this debate is 'We should subsidize space exploration'. The proponent argues that space exploration should be subsidized while opponents claim that it can be carried by the private sector, is expensive, ineffective and that there are more important issues to fund. In support of the proponent, evidence shows that the private sector has made significant progress in space travel, with companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin achieving key feats, and NASA turning to the private sector to develop the spacecraft for their Artemis mission. Moreover, the private sector and partnerships have the potential to rapidly expand space exploration, with the benefit of satellite technology already being experienced. Conversely, opponents suggest that space exploration is expensive, with rockets costing $10,000 per pound to put into orbit and a reputed cost of $20 million per head for space tourists. In addition, they argue that the money spent on space exploration could be better used elsewhere, such as to alleviate poverty or to fund other important issues. Therefore, it is clear that both proponents and opponents have compelling arguments, and it is up to the debaters to decide whether space exploration should be subsidized or not."
"
Summary: The topic of the debate is 'We should subsidize space exploration'. Proponents of this argument make the claims that space exploration can help colonize resources/lands of other planets, improve science/technology, be financially beneficial, and is necessary for the future survival of humanity. Moreover, space exploration can unravel information about the universe. Evidence in favor of these claims includes that space colonies can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche, satellite imagery and climate data can help sectors like agriculture, space exploration can create jobs and jumpstart businesses, and space robotics can gather scientifically valuable data. All these claims are put forward to suggest that subsidizing space exploration can offer humanity significant benefits."
"
In the debate about whether we should subsidize vocational education, the opposition argues that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes, is expensive, leads to an influx in those professions, and is not a good career choice. Evidence supporting the claim that subsidizing vocational education diverts money includes a 2016 report by the Education Trust which found that this could disadvantage low-income students, a 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research which found that it could divert money from other important programs, and a 2019 report by the Government Accountability Office which found that it may not adequately address workforce development needs. Evidence supporting the claim that subsidizing vocational education is expensive includes a 2018 report by the Center for American Progress which found that it requires significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty, and a 2021 study by the National Conference of State Legislatures which found that it can compete with other important priorities for funding and resources. Evidence supporting the claim that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions includes a study that analyzed the effects of a program in Germany which found that the program increased the demand for skilled workers in the relevant trades, and a study that analyzed the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany which found that the subsidies led to a significant increase in enrollment and employment in those fields. Lastly, evidence supporting the claim that vocational education is not a good career choice includes a 2018 study by the National Skills Coalition which found that many vocational education programs prepare students for low-wage jobs, and a 2019 report by the American Federation of Teachers which found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement."
"
The debate topic is 'We should subsidize vocational education'. The stance is positive and there are four claims with evidence to support it. Claim_1 states that subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources. Evidence shows that it can improve workforce development for those with barriers to employment, increase job opportunities for individuals who may not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education, increase enrollment for underrepresented groups, and better align with local labor market needs. Claim_2 is that vocational education better fits many students. Evidence indicates that these programs are designed to meet current workforce needs, have lower dropout rates, provide a more direct path to employment, have a career-focused curriculum, and offer customized learning experiences. Claim_3 states that vocational education is a good career choice. Evidence shows that individuals with vocational education have higher earning potential, a shorter time to employment, and lower student debt. Finally, Claim_4 argues that vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society. Evidence shows that it can address workforce shortages, increase workforce productivity, enhance social mobility, promote workforce diversity, and support local economies. In conclusion, the evidence supports the stance that subsidizing vocational education is a good choice, as it can benefit those with fewer resources, better fit the needs and interests of many students, be a good career choice, and be beneficial for the entire market/society."
