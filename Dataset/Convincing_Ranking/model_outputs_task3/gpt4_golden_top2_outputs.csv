"Opponents argue that assisted suicide gives dignity to the person who chooses it. They substantiate this claim with the prevalence of the term dignity in organizations and laws advocating for assisted suicide, such as Dignitas in Europe and the American Death with Dignity Acts. Furthermore, campaigns like Dignity in Dying advocate for law changes to allow terminally ill, mentally competent adults to opt for an assisted death within strict rules and safeguards. Secondly, opponents assert that assisted suicide reduces suffering. They present evidence of certain regions where euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if certain criteria are met, which include the patient's unbearable and hopeless suffering and the absence of reasonable alternatives. Moreover, studies show that just having the option for assisted suicide brings peace of mind to patients and reduces their suffering. Thirdly, they argue that people should have the freedom to choose to end their lives. This is backed by the practice of physician-assisted suicide (PAD) wherein a competent, suffering patient requests the means to end their life. They also reference the Netherlands, where euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide have been legalized since 2002, demonstrating the exercise of this freedom. Lastly, they argue that the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide, citing instances of individuals like Pratchett who wished to die by assisted suicide before their diseases reached a critical point. Additionally, they point to the experiences of countries where euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are permitted, suggesting that these practices may be acceptable in certain situations."
"Proponents contend that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role. They back this claim with instances where organizations have warned against doctors becoming agents of a patient's death, and laws like in New York that criminalize physician-assisted suicide. Secondly, they argue that people do not have the right to self-harm or harm others. They substantiate this by referencing Supreme Court rulings that upheld the prohibition of assisted suicide as it is not a fundamental liberty interest protected under the Constitution. Thirdly, they maintain that people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help, suggesting the potential for a 'slippery slope' if assisted suicide or euthanasia is permitted. They reference critiques of the Netherlands' practices, indicating the potential for non-voluntary euthanasia of vulnerable groups if the current restrictions are loosened."
"They argue that homeschooling is often the best option for exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students. This is substantiated with the services provided by agencies like Eastern York Schools to district home-schooled students and examples of families choosing homeschooling due to unique circumstances, like living in isolated rural locations or traveling extensively. Secondly, they posit that homeschooling can be personalized to the child's pace and needs. They cite examples of successful individuals like Gosling, who credit homeschooling for their sense of autonomy. Furthermore, homeschooling allows for an adaptable education based on the child's interests, abilities, and learning style, leading to increased engagement and personal development. Thirdly, they argue against mainstream schools due to the prevalent violence and bullying. They support this claim by citing the motive of homeschoolers to protect their children from violence, drugs, and psychological abuse in traditional schools. Fourthly, they maintain that parents should be allowed to choose their children's education. They back this with examples of parents wanting a deeper understanding"
"The advocates of banning homeschooling present compelling arguments. They argue that homeschooling lacks standardization and regulation, citing Vyckie Garrison's account of homeschooling her children amidst life-threatening pregnancies and limited regulation in Nebraska. They argue that without sufficient regulation, homeschooling can potentially allow instances of child abuse to go unnoticed and essential services, such as adequate nutrition and vaccinations, provided by public schools to be missed. Further, they stress the importance of mainstream schools in developing social skills. They highlight that homeschooled children often miss out on experiences like work experience opportunities, sports leagues, and recognition and reward systems. They quote Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet who underscores the importance of community values, social values, democratic values, and tolerance, which children can gain from mainstream schools. The proponents also question the educational quality of homeschooling. They cite the National Education Association's opposition to homeschooling and the European Court of Human Rights upholding a German ban on homeschooling, stating that the right to education calls for regulation by the state. Lastly, they question parents' qualifications to teach, warning of the potential for a one-sided point of view and the immense responsibility of meeting all of a child's educational needs. They cite Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich who wrote about the potential dangers of homeschooling in terms of limiting children's exposure to diverse viewpoints."
"Opponents of mandatory child vaccinations argue about the potential dangers and side effects of these vaccines. They point to examples such as the Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, that was withdrawn from the market due to its potential contribution to bowel obstruction. They also mention that the CDC acknowledges a link between the chickenpox vaccine and pneumonia, and a small possibility exists that the flu vaccine could lead to Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome. Further, they argue that mandatory vaccination infringes on basic rights, citing the First Amendment of the US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They contend that mandatory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity and private life."
"Supporters of mandatory child vaccinations argue that these vaccines are effective. They provide evidence such as the substantial decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and the dramatic reduction in polio cases worldwide, thanks to vaccination programs. They stress that child vaccinations save lives, referring to an estimate that full vaccination of all US children born in a year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections. They also cite the World Health Organization (WHO), which estimates that vaccination prevents millions of deaths per year. Moreover, supporters emphasize the necessity of routine child vaccinations to protect others. They cite instances such as a measles outbreak in the U.S. in 2005 due to an unvaccinated teenager and a 2012 outbreak of pertussis due to low herd immunity in 49 US states. They assert that mandatory vaccinations are crucial to prevent virus/disease spreading, citing the eradication of deadly diseases like smallpox and the efficacy of vaccines like the pertussis vaccine. Finally, they argue that children should not have to suffer from preventable diseases. They reference the fact that vaccine-preventable diseases cause millions of childhood deaths each year and that vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths, to the extent that the World Health Organization characterizes it as one of the top ten global health threats."
"The opponents of the topic argue that government regulation of social media platforms is ineffective, detrimental to privacy, inhibits freedom of speech, and potentially leads to political abuses. They underline that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), enacted in 2018, failed to effectively discipline prominent platforms like Facebook and Google regarding their data-collection practices. Citing the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) inability to prevent unlawful data transfer of 87 million user records, they question the efficacy of such regulations. Additionally, they believe these regulations compromise user privacy, referencing a Pew Research Center survey where a majority of respondents felt their personal information was out of their control and at risk. They argue that such regulation suppresses freedom of speech and could jeopardize democratic rights, as evidenced by Vietnam's cybersecurity law and its negative impact on activists and journalists. They further caution against government intervention in private entities, citing potential inefficiencies and disruptions. Lastly, they warn of potential political abuse, pointing out instances of misleading political advertisements."
"The proponents of the topic argue that government regulation of social media platforms is crucial for protecting younger audiences, combating fake news, benefiting society at large, dealing with negative content, and managing malicious users. They stress the importance of statutory regulators to safeguard young users from harmful content, highlighted by the tragic case of Molly Russell, a British teenager exposed to distressing content on Instagram. They underline the need for regulation to combat misinformation, noting a widespread belief in the public that major news organizations frequently produce false information. They emphasize the societal benefits of such regulation, referencing potential legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union aimed at enhancing transparency and combating manipulative techniques. They stress the role of regulation in managing negative content, such as hate speech and terrorist propaganda. Finally, they cite the need for regulation to prevent unauthorized access to accounts, which affected 60 million cases in 2011."
"The opponents of the topic argue that the US has unfair health and education policies, a problematic political system, a negative culture, high living costs, high inequality levels, safety issues, and is xenophobic or racist. They assert that the healthcare system is disproportionately unaffordable for Black and Hispanic adults, and that racial bias persists in education. They contend that the political system is divisive, as revealed by the 2020 presidential election. They criticize the culture for being disrespectful and self-centered. They bemoan the high taxation and living costs, especially in cities like Manhattan where middle-income families struggle to make ends meet. They highlight the stark wealth disparity, with the top 10% of Americans owning nearly 70% of the wealth, and the persisting homelessness problem. They express concerns about safety due to the high fear of violent crime among the public. Lastly, they mention instances of racism and xenophobia, citing hate crimes against Asian Americans and arguments of white supremacy in school curriculum."
"Supporters of the notion that the USA is a good country to live in often point to several factors that make it a desirable destination for living. First, the high standard of living and robust economy of the USA are key factors in this regard. The per capita income in the country, as of 2015, was $56,300, one of the highest globally, highlighting the robustness of its economy. Moreover, an analysis by Joseph Sullivan for the National Review demonstrated the U.S.'s superior economic growth between 2016 and 2019 compared to other developed nations. Second, the strength of the U.S.'s education and health systems is also a significant draw. U.S. universities have a sterling reputation globally, with 40 out of the top 100 universities located in the U.S in a 2014 survey. Additionally, the U.S. surpasses the OECD average for adults aged 25-64 who have completed upper secondary education. Third, the U.S.'s environment and nature are widely admired. The country is home to a vast array of natural wonders, from sprawling canyons and towering sand dunes to huge glaciers and picturesque valleys. Fourth, democratic rights and freedoms are an integral part of American life. The American Declaration of Independence is a landmark document in the history of human rights, and the First Amendment guarantees the right to gather in peaceful public protest. Fifth, U.S. culture and its people have a significant global impact, drawing influences from every region of the world. Sixth, the U.S. stands as a powerful global entity, consistently ranked as the world's most powerful country by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and U.S. News & World Report. Finally, the U.S. offers exceptional opportunities for individuals, notably in terms of career prospects. The country is home to many of the world's biggest companies, offering unparalleled career opportunities and impressive job growth."
"Opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy point to various religious and personal factors. Firstly, they argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus more closely on God, a perspective supported by teachings from Paul in the Bible. This commitment is further bolstered by God's grace, providing sustenance to live a celibate life dedicated to God. Secondly, celibacy is regarded as a strong religious belief. It has been held in high esteem from the church's beginnings and is considered a spiritual marriage with Christ. Thirdly, celibacy enhances the perception of priests as holy. They argue that a priest's choice of celibate life is based on a divine love that feeds their dedication to celibacy. Fourthly, it is important to note that priests consciously choose to lead celibate lives. Various individuals have taken vows of celibacy, obedience, and poverty in front of religious authorities, indicating their willingness to live this way. Fifthly, they believe religious experiences and traditions should be preserved, as they are a testament to the long-standing value of celibacy within the Church. Finally, they argue that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, with the Archbishop of Vienna and the Catholic Church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia suggesting a possible link between celibacy and sex abuse scandals."
"the supporters argue that this vow is outdated, too difficult, unnatural, a potential cause of inappropriate sexual behavior, and it discourages people from becoming priests. They illustrate the claim that celibacy is outdated using evidence such as Pope Paul III's commutation of the vow of celibacy to conjugal fidelity in 1540 and scholars like George T. Dennis SJ and Peter Fink SJ who assert that there's no clear evidence of a tradition or obligation of priestly celibacy before the fourth century. They support the claim that celibacy is difficult with personal experiences such as Jimmy O'Brien's remark about sexual chemistry making celibacy a tough lifestyle, and historic accounts of nuns experiencing hardships following their vow of celibacy. On the unnatural nature of celibacy, they cite the argument that all living organisms are meant to reproduce, and Ford's suggestion that the conflict between celibacy and longing for intimacy contributed to Nouwen's depression. They bolster the argument that celibacy leads to wrong sexual behavior by citing the alarming number of allegations of sexual abuse against Catholic priests and deacons in the US in 2004, and instances of priests like Urbain Grandier breaking their vows of celibacy. Lastly, they argue that celibacy discourages people from becoming priests, with evidence such as Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck's support for the ordination of women and ending clerical celibacy to address priest shortage, and Gerard's complaint about York canons refusing ordination to avoid celibacy."
"Opponents argue that marriage benefits children, is important for religious or traditional reasons, brings happiness, strengthens couple bonding, and provides financial benefits. They point out that marriage benefits children, providing evidence such as the roles of mothers and fathers in a child's development, and a 2010 CDC study showing that children from homes with married parents fare better in all categories. They assert that marriage is important traditionally or religiously, with evidence of the adverse effects of father absence on children and the concept of marriage mirroring our Creator's unconditional love. They cite studies indicating that married people are generally happier than their unmarried counterparts and Pew's data that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness and satisfaction. In terms of relationship strengthening, they cite a survey indicating that married adults are more satisfied and trusting in their relationship than cohabiting adults and feel closer to their spouses than to any other adult. Lastly, they argue that marriage provides financial benefits, citing the advantages of joint income and eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits."
"Proponents argue that marriage perpetuates harmful norms for women, is unstable, enforces unfair obligations, and that most advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship. They argue that marriage preserves harmful norms for women, providing evidence of expectations for women to be submissive to male family members, and the occurrence of female genital mutilation as a prerequisite to marriage. They support the claim that marriages are unstable with evidence such as the upward trend in global divorce rates since the 1970s and the finding that changes in women's employment expectations have possibly influenced divorce rates. They argue that marriage enforces unfair obligations, providing examples like Qatar's laws that require women to have male guardian permission to marry and the inequality within laws governing marital relations. Lastly, they argue that the advantages of marriage can be achieved by a monogamous relationship, citing the dominance of monogamy in many societies today and the stability that a single-partner relationship offers."
"Opponents of abandoning school uniforms put forth a range of arguments in their favor. They argue that school uniforms do not inhibit self-expression, evidenced by a former Hershey High School student's op-ed and research by Andrea Dashiell, which found that 54% of eighth graders still felt expressive despite a uniform policy. Moreover, they argue that uniforms help reduce bullying, citing evidence from the Department of Education and a study commissioned by Trutex, both highlighting the role of uniforms in reducing bullying. Furthermore, proponents of school uniforms believe that they foster a sense of equality and unity among students. This is supported by a study in Texas which found that students wearing uniforms reported stronger perceptions of belonging to their school community. They also argue that uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning. This is emphasized by the sentiment of educators like Natasha Irshad who stated that uniforms minimize distractions, allowing students to concentrate more on their studies. Lastly, they maintain that uniforms are cost-effective. An NY Post article showed that the average American family could save up to $150 per child on back-to-school clothing, which over a 12-year career could amount to a savings of $1800. A similar observation was made in a UK study comparing the costs of school uniforms and non-school outfits."
"Supporters of abandoning school uniforms argue that uniforms stifle learning and creativity. They reference views of experts like Tara Maginnis and student Alyse Madsen, both highlighting the repressive and creativity-hindering effects of uniforms. They also believe that uniforms harm self-expression, pointing to a study carried out at Arizona State University and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which both underline students' rights to self-expression. Moreover, they contend that school uniforms are expensive, with the Children‚Äôs Society estimating the average cost of a school uniform to be ¬£340. They also argue that school uniforms can be uncomfortable and even discriminatory, citing a GLSEN study and Laura Bates's perspective on dress codes and sexism. Finally, they argue that uniforms encourage conformity at the expense of individuality, with research showing that personal choice in clothing encourages independent thinking and better prepares children for adulthood. This argument is underscored by the experience of a 17-year-old student who felt her sense of individuality was diminished by a uniform policy."
"Opponents of abolishing capital punishment argue that it brings justice and closure for victims' families. This is exemplified by the statements of South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster and Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge who believe capital punishment provides closure and is warranted for heinous crimes. They also argue that capital punishment is appropriate for severe crimes, supported by the stances of the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Human Rights Watch. Furthermore, they maintain that capital punishment acts as a deterrent against crime. David Muhlhausen of the Heritage Foundation, and a study by Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd both argue that the death penalty indeed deters crime, with the latter claiming that each execution results in, on average, eighteen fewer murders."
"Supporters of abolishing capital punishment argue that it is principally wrong, harms the disenfranchised, and is irreversible. They claim that the death penalty is applied unjustly, often dependent on factors like wealth, the skill of attorneys, race, and location of the crime. They point to evidence such as the fact that over 156 people have been released from death rows due to innocence since 1973, highlighting the risk of wrongful execution. These supporters also argue that the death penalty harms the disenfranchised, asserting that the high costs associated with death penalty cases divert resources from other areas. They cite a 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts which found that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. Finally, they claim that the death penalty is irreversible, which is especially concerning given it doesn't necessarily deter crime. Freelance author Emmaline Soken-Huberty argues that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent, pointing out that the murder rate in states without the death penalty is much lower."
"Opponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that these rights incentivize creativity and innovation, incentivize investment in developing new products, protect against stealing, and allow owners to be compensated for their efforts. They highlight the goal of intellectual property protection in promoting the development of new products, as expressed by UPOV and Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy. They further assert that without intellectual property protections, there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organizations to produce intangible assets. The Business Software Alliance's 2011 piracy study supports this view, as it showed public opinion favoring payment to innovators. Finally, they contend that intellectual property rights protect against stealing, and are essential for ensuring owners of such properties benefit financially from their creations. Senator Leahy and the NIPRCC have both highlighted the importance of protecting intellectual property rights for this purpose."
"Supporters of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that these rights prevent the continuous improvement of products/services, restrict access to important information/products, are unfair, harm creativity/innovation, waste money, and are ineffective. They cite the case of Fox Talbot in the 19th century, whose insistence on his intellectual property rights was viewed as hampering the development of photography in England. They also argue that intellectual property rights restrict access to crucial information and products, as observed by Professor Lessig, who analyzes the tension between concepts of piracy and property. They believe that these rights are unfair and can actually harm creativity and innovation, again using the Fox Talbot example and Murray Rothbard's argument. Furthermore, they claim that intellectual property rights waste money, arguing that gaining protection can be expensive. They also assert that these rights are ineffective, with some arguing that intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state."
"Opponents of this stance maintain that gun control is ineffective, presenting evidence such as a 2016 Bureau of Justice Statistics study that found only 10.1% of criminals obtained firearms from legal sources, while a separate study in Applied Economics Letters suggested that gun restrictions did not significantly impact murder rates. They also assert gun ownership as a fundamental right, citing the U.S. Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which upheld an individual's right to possess firearms, as well as Professor Nelson Lund's assertion that self-defense is a 'basic natural right.' Furthermore, opponents argue that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports-shooting, referencing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's data that nearly half of all hunters also participate in target shooting. Lastly, the opponents argue that gun ownership promotes self-protection, with a Gallup survey indicating that 63% of gun owners cite personal safety as their primary reason for owning a firearm."
"Proponents for abolishing the right to keep and bear arms argue that such a measure would save lives. They cite a study from the American Journal of Public Health which associated legal handgun purchases with an increased risk of violent death, as well as Harvard professor David Hemenway's research linking greater gun availability to higher homicide rates in developed countries. Proponents also argue that gun ownership increases the risk of mass shootings and general gun violence, with evidence including a 1993 study in The New England Journal of Medicine that associated guns kept at home with an increased risk of homicide. Furthermore, they contend that guns can fall into the wrong hands, citing instances like the Sutherland Springs massacre where the shooter, despite a domestic violence conviction, was able to purchase guns. Lastly, the proponents emphasize that guns can lead to accidental deaths, especially among those under 25 years old."
"Opponents argue that austerity cuts access to essential services, with evidence including reports of significant budget cuts to local authority budgets and welfare for children and families in the UK. They also contend that austerity exacerbates recessions, citing instances where austerity measures have had contractionary effects on economies such as Argentina, Russia, and Turkey. They assert that austerity is unfair to citizens, pointing to a UN report that described levels of child poverty in the UK as a 'social calamity and an economic disaster.' Further, opponents argue that austerity results in lower economic growth, citing Greece's economic struggles following an austerity program imposed by the EU and ECB. Finally, they claim that austerity policies lead to lower job creation, referring to the high unemployment rates in countries such as Greece and Spain following the implementation of austerity measures."
"Proponents for adopting an austerity regime put forth the following arguments: First, they state that austerity improves economic measures. Evidence is presented through the cases of Latvia and Estonia, and Canada, where an economic rebound or sustained growth was observed following austerity measures. Secondly, supporters argue that austerity is important in the long term. They believe that reducing budget deficits boosts investors' confidence, resulting in an improved economic performance in the long run. They refer to reports from the EU Commission and certain economists as evidence. Thirdly, they assert that austerity increases stability. This is supported by examples of countries like Morocco, where austerity measures and pro-market reforms have led to economic stability, steady growth, and a gradual decrease in unemployment. Fourth, austerity is posited as necessary to reduce deficits or repay debts. This is substantiated by a World Bank study, indicating that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period, it impairs economic growth, and that austerity helps avoid a sovereign debt crisis. Finally, supporters argue that an austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times. They point to examples such as the global economic downturn of 2008, and the successful austerity model in the US between 1920 and 1921, where the federal budget was drastically cut and debt reduced, leading to economic recovery."
"Opponents of the adoption of atheism put forth these arguments: First, they state that atheism discriminates against religious people and infringes upon freedom of religion. They refer to John Locke's assertion that atheism could undermine social order and lead to chaos, and criticism towards the film 'The Golden Compass' as potential encouragement of atheism among children. Secondly, they argue that the choice to adopt atheism should be a personal one. This is supported by Liddle's argument that choosing to believe in God or not is a matter of personal preference with no scientific proof either way, and a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights stating that one cannot be forced to exhibit views or behaviors associated with a specific religion."
"Proponents for the adoption of atheism argue the following: First, they claim that atheism is beneficial to those who adopt it. They present Baggini's and La Mettrie's arguments suggesting that atheism provides a superior basis for ethics and liberation from various forms of oppression. Secondly, supporters argue that atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists. They reference Michael Scriven's and a metaphysically courageous atheist's arguments stating that atheism is justified in the absence of evidence for God's existence. Thirdly, they assert that religions are immoral and should not be followed. They argue that religion confuses obedience with morality, as true morality involves considering the consequences of actions, and state that religion is immoral as it is based on untruths. Finally, supporters claim that science can adequately explain the Universe. They provide evidence suggesting that atheists or agnostics are often more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths, and posit that the atheism offered by scientific naturalism perspective can find moral truth, objective value, and goodness."
"The critics argue that libertarianism can lead to detrimental effects such as economic decline, harm to minorities, unjust societal structures, the removal of vital laws and services, and weakening the government's role in protecting citizen rights. Firstly, the critics present the example of Northern Rock's ¬£27 billion failure, linked to libertarian economic philosophy, and the works of Steven Teles and Brink Lindsey, critiquing laws and regulations derived from poor policymaking, arguing they potentially suppress economic growth and exacerbate inequality. Secondly, citing thinkers like Robert Nozick and James P. Sterba, the critics highlight libertarianism's potential harm to minorities and those who are worse off. Nozick's potential acceptance of consensual enslavement contracts in a purely libertarian society, and Sterba's ethical arguments emphasizing the prioritization of the liberty of the poor, form part of this critique. The third argument questions the justice and equality of libertarianism. Critics utilize examples of market failures leading to unequal outcomes, like those outlined by economist Joseph Stiglitz, and historical occurrences like slavery to illustrate the potential injustices of libertarianism. Critics' fourth contention highlights the risk of losing essential laws, infrastructure, and government services under libertarianism. They underline libertarian's support for legalizing so-called 'victimless crimes' and focus on protecting natural rights, which may lead to the stripping of vital government services. Lastly, the critics highlight the essential role of government in protecting citizen rights. They cite evidence from Human Rights Watch emphasizing the government's role in safeguarding basic human rights and reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change underscoring the necessity of governmental action in environmental protection."
"Supporters argue that it increases economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfillment, and individual liberties. First, proponents cite the works of Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins, who suggest a combination of libertarianism and green politics can produce both economic and environmental benefits. They also argue that reduced taxation, a key principle of libertarianism, can lead to increased financial freedom and economic prosperity. Secondly, supporters argue that reducing government intervention leads to increased individual freedom. They reference studies by the Cato Institute and economists like Milton Friedman to assert that countries with less government intervention have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth. Thirdly, the proponents argue that libertarianism increases happiness and fulfillment. They cite psychologists like Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and philosophers like Ayn Rand, who argue that individuals are happiest when they are free to make their own decisions and pursue their interests. Finally, the supporters argue that libertarianism enhances individual liberties. They reference Sunstein and Thaler, who assert that people should generally be free to opt out of undesirable arrangements, and Rothbard, who argues in favor of the self-ownership principle as a universal ethic."
"We stand against the notion of banning human cloning. We believe that human cloning has the potential to bring significant benefits to our society. To begin with, our first argument is that cloning can be a lifesaver, serving as a powerful tool for organ replication. According to the World Health Organization, many people die while waiting for a suitable organ for transplantation. Cloning can alleviate this by creating personalized organs that are specific to an individual's needs, reducing the risk of rejection, and improving the success rate of transplantation. Secondly, human cloning can be a beacon of hope for those unable to have a child. Studies from the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics and the Journal of Medical Ethics demonstrate how cloning can assist couples struggling with infertility, providing them with the opportunity to have a child genetically related to them. Furthermore, human cloning promotes health and advances science. Cloning could be used to produce stem cells that can treat various diseases, as evidenced by a study in the Nature journal. Legislation like New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two have already recognized the scientific importance of cloning for stem cell research. We should not halt this progression of scientific discovery."
"Despite the arguments put forth, we stand firm that human cloning should be banned. Our first point is, cloning is not fully understood yet. As Kass writes, a society that tolerates cloning risks losing its ethical and moral fabric, turning procreation into an act of mere manufacture. Moreover, cloning goes against our moral and religious principles. Pope John Paul II and The National Council of Ethics of Portugal, among others, have unequivocally stated that the process of human cloning, involving manipulation and destruction of human embryos, is unacceptable. In addition, cloning is inherently unnatural. It fundamentally disrupts the familial order and the natural process of procreation. Cloning is not an act of love between two people; it is an act of cell manipulation for self-interest. Finally, cloning is unsafe. The FDA warns of the risks associated with sexually transmitted diseases in the cloning process. Plus, research in Nature Reviews Genetics reports the low success rate and potential health problems in cloned animals."
"We firmly oppose the banning of private military companies. Our first point is the financial benefit. Research published in the Defense and Security Analysis journal and a report by the Congressional Research Service, show that private military companies can provide more cost-effective services than traditional military personnel. Secondly, these companies often provide specialized training and have access to advanced technology. This means they are better equipped to respond to modern warfare techniques and threats, adding a valuable layer of defense. Thirdly, these companies can supplement regular armies, providing access to specialized skills and expertise not always available within traditional military structures. They can also offload non-core tasks from the regular army, allowing them to focus on their primary mission. Lastly, private military companies can enhance safety. Reports by the Heritage Foundation suggest that these companies provide essential support services, improve resource use efficiency, and thereby contribute to a safer operational environment."
"We stand firm in our belief that private military companies should be banned. Our reasons are manifold. Firstly, these companies have shown a tendency to commit unethical practices and human rights violations. The United Nations report in 2004 highlighted their usage of child soldiers in conflict zones, and the Congressional Research Service in 2010 noted unlawful civilian killings perpetrated by these companies. Secondly, there is a significant issue regarding the lack of professionalism and accountability within these firms. Amnesty International in 2009 and Human Rights Watch in 2006 have provided evidence of poor training standards and a lack of accountability within these companies. Moreover, the loyalty of private military companies is not guaranteed, with conflicts of interest arising from serving multiple nations. A Journal of Military Ethics study in 2009 and a Congressional Research Service report in 2012 have highlighted these concerns. Further, their primary interest seems to be profit, as shown by the 2010 International Affairs study, leading to questionable ethical practices as found by the 2006 Human Rights Watch report. Lastly, these companies have a vested interest in prolonging conflict for their financial gain, as highlighted by the Project on Government Oversight report in 2008 and the Congressional Research Service report in 2009."
"We firmly oppose the banning of child actors. It is not uncommon for acting to be a child's dream. The Drama Teachers Association of America in 2011 and the American Psychological Association in 2010 have highlighted how acting can be a channel for children to express their emotions and exhibit their talents. Children are also essential for certain roles, adding to the diversity in casting as pointed out by the National Association of Theatre Owners in 2013, and having played an important role in the development of drama throughout history. Furthermore, as long as there is adequate supervision and regulation, child actors should be allowed to work. It's not unheard of to film around a child actor, following child labor laws, as seen in numerous TV and film productions. Lastly, it should be the parents' decision whether their child works as an actor. The Journal of Family Psychology in 2013 affirms the importance of parents' roles in providing individualized attention and care for their children's development and well-being."
"We stand by the belief that the use of child actors should be banned. Their education is often compromised due to their work schedules, as found by the Journal of Education and Practice in 2013. The American Psychological Association in 2017 also found a correlation between the acting profession and high stress levels in child actors. Child actors are also vulnerable to exploitation. Studies published in the Journal of Adolescence in 2012 and the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014, highlighted labor violations and the risk of human trafficking in the industry. These children also risk losing their childhood as they are exposed to unhealthy working conditions, as highlighted by the 2016 UNICEF report. In addition, these young performers often experience intense pressure, leading to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, as noted by studies in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence and the Journal of Pediatrics in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Lastly, many child actors face issues in their adult life due to the stress of their careers, as shown by the troubled adult lives of many former child actors. The lack of a stable identity after their careers end can lead to profound issues, as demonstrated by the case of Herbert and other similar instances."
"Opponents to the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp argue primarily on three fronts. Firstly, they maintain that closing the camp could threaten national security. Evidence from the National Intelligence director suggests that a considerable number (17.5%) of former detainees who were transferred to other countries reengaged in terrorist or insurgent activities. Moreover, among the remaining 80 detainees, most are hardened terrorists, suggesting their transfer could pose security risks. Secondly, opponents argue that the camp is more beneficial for detainees compared to alternative facilities. They cite the state-of-the-art nature of the facility, its compliance with the Geneva Convention, and the high standard of treatment provided to detainees, exceeding that of most maximum-security prisons worldwide. The camp is also notably away from population centers, thus ensuring maximum security and minimising escape risks. Lastly, they highlight the essential role the camp plays in intelligence gathering. Guantanamo Bay, initially chosen for its strategic advantages, has evolved into an intelligence center, crucial for understanding the operation of terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. The ability to bring terrorists into this center presents an unprecedented opportunity to protect the nation through the collection of vital intelligence."
"Supporters of closing Guantanamo Bay detention camp primarily argue that detainees should have the right to trial in U.S. courts. They refer to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of Boumediene v. Bush, which granted detainees the right to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts. The camp is also viewed as damaging the U.S. image and reputation, being seen as a disregard for the rule of law and a recruiting tool for terrorists. Guantanamo Bay is further perceived as a symbol of injustice and discrimination, making it a target for global criticism. Supporters point out that the camp has been a center of abuse and disregard for the rule of law. They also emphasize the significant costs associated with the camp. With an annual cost of $540 million and around $13 million per prisoner, critics argue that the camp is unduly expensive. Allegations of crimes against prisoners and unjust treatment and tactics used at the camp provide additional reasons for closure. Evidence of abuse, torture, and unfair legal processes make the camp a contentious issue, with some viewing it as a violation of human rights."
"Opponents of ending affirmative action argue that it increases diversity, compensates for the past, and reduces discrimination. Diversity in schools, colleges, and workplaces has been demonstrated to increase due to affirmative action, with one study showing a significant decline in the admission of students of color to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban. They also posit that affirmative action is necessary to correct past discrimination, with the policy defined as a means to rectify past or present discrimination and prevent future occurrences. This stance is supported by President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 endorsement of affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation. Finally, opponents argue that affirmative action reduces discrimination. Evidence from Johnson v. Transportation Agency upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' in traditionally segregated job categories. The National Organization for Women (NOW) also pointed out that affirmative action levels the playing field, allowing people of color and women to compete more equitably in education and business."
"Proponents claim that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities. They argue that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of those it aims to help, as it may create a perception that they achieved success not due to their abilities but because of their minority status. This is supported by evidence such as views of opponents like George Sher, who argues that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of individuals chosen based on their social group rather than their qualifications. The proponents further contend that affirmative action is ineffective, as evidenced by the passage of a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action (Proposition 107) by Arizona voters in 2010. Moreover, they highlight the discrepancies within minority groups, where privileged African Americans gain upward mobility through affirmative action while the less-skilled and less-educated counterparts are left behind. Another significant claim raised by supporters of ending affirmative action is that it is unjust, particularly to Asian-American students. The ongoing lawsuit by Students for Fair Admissions Inc. against Harvard University alleges that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students, suggesting a bias in the admission process. Furthermore, they argue that affirmative action is a form of performative activism, as it seems more concerned about appearances rather than ensuring marginalized communities have equal opportunities.The stance against affirmative action is also premised on the belief that it perpetuates prejudice and is a form of reverse discrimination. This belief is supported by the ruling of Gratz v. Bollinger, where certain policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial or gender quotas, were ruled as unconstitutional. Lastly, ending affirmative action supporters argue it reduces quality. Citing Clint Bolick and data from the University of Texas, they point out that less-qualified minorities are often given preference over more-qualified non-minorities due to race-based affirmative action programs. They argue these programs mask the deeper systemic issues in education and training, ultimately doing a disservice to those they aim to assist."
"The opponents argue that mandatory retirement creates opportunities for younger workers. The International Labour Organization's 2012 report highlights that mandatory retirement ages can boost employment opportunities for young people, a claim supported by a 2016 study by the World Economic Forum asserting that it promotes intergenerational equity."
"Supporters of ending mandatory retirement contend that it decreases institutional knowledge. By citing policies like the UK's lack of a mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers, they highlight that this policy can harm the economy by impeding workforce diversity and decreasing labor force participation, as indicated by the World Economic Forum and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Proponents further argue that mandatory retirement is unfair and discriminatory, often resulting in age discrimination. They point to a report by the American Association of Retired Persons and a study by the International Labour Organization, which indicate that mandatory retirement disregards individual circumstances such as health, financial status, and personal preferences. There is also a concern about the reduction in the quality of life for those forced to retire, as evidenced by research indicating health declines and decreased economic well-being following mandatory retirement. Supporters conclude with the argument that people should retire when they are ready, a move that promotes active aging and individual well-being, as evidenced by the American Association of Retired Persons and the World Health Organization."
"In the topic of 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', those opposing the argument posit that nuclear weapons are crucial for deterrence and protection. They substantiate this stance with evidence that highlights how the strategy of deterrence has been effective in maintaining peace for nearly 70 years. An example provided is the invasion of Ukraine, which, they argue, was not a failure of nuclear deterrence, as Ukraine was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. Instead, the instance is used to point out that countries without deterrence protection are more susceptible to such a fate, while those under its protection are safe from major, frontal military attacks."
"Supporters of the abolition of nuclear weapons argue that these weapons pose significant risks, such as falling into the wrong hands. They cite recent propaganda from ISIS claiming they could acquire nuclear weapons within a year. They also reference the possibility of accidents, human errors, irresponsible leadership, nuclear terrorism, hacking of the nuclear chain of command, or a combination of these factors. Additionally, they argue that nuclear weapons could provoke or escalate disastrous military action, providing evidence of potential casualty estimates from a hypothetical Soviet nuclear attack during the Cold War. They further underline Russia's recent threats to use nuclear weapons during the ongoing Ukraine conflict."
"Those against this viewpoint argue that urbanization offers more opportunities, benefits the economy, and even the environment. They put forward evidence that migration to urban areas is generally motivated by the promise of a better life, and that urbanization leads to increased economic opportunities. As an example, they refer to China's urbanization policies that encouraged privatization of agriculture, rural industrial development, and international investment. They also assert that urbanization has positive effects on economic growth, bringing technological advancements and diversifying products and occupations. On the environmental front, they claim that urbanization drives the development of green technologies and leads to higher productivity with lower ecological footprint due to economies of scale and positive externalities."
"Proponents make several claims, starting with the notion that restrictions on migration would economically and socially benefit people in rural areas. They provide evidence from Venezuela, where urbanization has led to significant rural depopulation and abandonment, resulting in the country becoming a net food importer despite its rich arable lands. In contrast, the protection of natural resources in rural India limited the drivers of rural to urban migration. The proponents also argue that urbanization results in increased crime rates. They point to the increased urban crime rates observed in MƒÅori communities and Bopal & Ghuma due to rapid urbanization and population growth. Further, they contend that urbanization harms the environment by polluting water supplies and increasing emissions of harmful pollutants such as sulfur dioxide. Finally, supporters argue that urbanization strains city resources, leading to poor living conditions, inadequate housing, and the creation of slums, backed by evidence from a UNESCO report and academic studies."
"The opponents argue that abstaining from a vote also reflects personal preferences. They cite evidence suggesting that abstention can indicate ambivalence, mild disapproval, or even a lack of adequate information about the issue at hand. They also argue that citizens have the right not to vote, a standpoint backed by U.S. legal scholars who see compulsory voting as a compelled speech act, violating freedom of speech. Opponents also believe that compulsory voting may lead to uninformed or random voting, as less informed voters are more susceptible to the influence of sensational advertising, potentially leading to misleading campaign tactics."
"Supporters of compulsory voting assert that it increases representation. They emphasize that with mandatory voting, politicians must address the needs of all voters, not just those who are more likely to vote voluntarily. They also argue that compulsory voting can stimulate greater interest in politics, as citizens are likely to pay more attention to political issues if they are obligated to vote. Moreover, supporters believe that citizens have an obligation to vote, noting that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms according to the European Court of Human Rights."
"Opponents argue that cannabis harms the body, pointing to a 2008 study from the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre that shows heavy cannabis smoking alters blood proteins linked to heart disease and stroke. They also reference Dutch research indicating that increased THC content may impair psychomotor skills, particularly in younger or inexperienced smokers. They argue that cannabis usage increases lack of judgement and can lead to accidents. Evidence for this includes a report showing that between 2000 to 2018, the percentage of fatal car crashes involving cannabis rose from 9% to 21.5%. Opponents also fear that cannabis is a gateway drug and can be addictive, citing the National Institute on Drug Abuse's explanation that THC triggers dopamine release, leading to a desire for repeated usage and potential addiction. Additionally, a 2006 study from the Karolinska Institute showed THC-altered opioid systems in rats, leading to more heroin usage. Lastly, they express concern that legalized cannabis could easily fall into the hands of underage teenagers or children. They cite the example of Alaska, where legalization in the 1970s resulted in the state's teens using cannabis at twice the national average, leading to its re-criminalization in 1990."
"Proponents argue that legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, which are more harmful, remain legal. They point to a 2002 DAWN report which showed that legal drugs caused more than half a million deaths a year. Proponents also argue that cannabis can be financially beneficial. They argue that its legalization could save billions in government spending on prohibition enforcement and generate billions more in annual tax revenues. Advocates for legalization also believe cannabis to be safe, with some therapeutic benefits. They argue that legalizing cannabis could result in regulated use and distribution. Finally, they claim that legalization could reduce black-market activity and criminal behavior, arguing that decriminalization would significantly decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black-market cannabis sales and trafficking."
"Opponents of this stance put forth three main arguments. Firstly, they argue that legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases. They back this up with studies showing an increase in HIV cases among prostitutes in Athens and the role of prostitution in maintaining STDs in the general population in places like Kenya. Secondly, they assert that legalization will promote immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking. They substantiate this with a report revealing a rise in organized crime and violence in Amsterdam's sex trade post-legalization, and research indicating a strong connection between prostitution, drug use, and non-drug crimes. Lastly, they contend that the legalization of sex work will escalate violence against women. Critics highlight Sweden's experience, where the proposition of legislation led to warnings of an increase in violence, along with feminist views emphasizing the perceived exploitation and reinforcement of patriarchal dominance involved in prostitution."
"Proponents of legalizing prostitution present several arguments. They maintain that legalization can boost the economy, pointing to historical examples where prostitution was deemed a functional part of the economy in places like Seattle. They also argue that legalization will increase sex workers' benefits, such as safety, health, and human rights, and cite advocacy from the Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour for more equitable regulations. Further, they argue that legalization will make the profession safer for women and improve regulation. This is supported by evidence from Dutch and Las Vegas policies that favored harm reduction and acknowledged the pragmatic benefits of a regulated sex trade. They also advocate that sex work is a valid personal choice and underscore the normalization and potential benefits of prostitution as seen in several studies."
"Critics of this proposition argue that sex selection can lead to gender imbalance, citing the skewed gender ratios in India and China due to a preference for boys. They also argue that sex selection reaffirms gender biases, with evidence from China showing son preference in strictly traditional families and rural areas even in the face of modernization and improved women's status. Lastly, they point out that sex selection can lead to abortions and infanticide, evidenced by the neglect and infanticide of girls resulting from China's one-child policy and son preference, which have been further exacerbated by improved sex-selection technology."
"Supporters of this stance argue for five key points. Firstly, they believe that it falls within the parents' freedoms to select the gender of their child. This is based on the evidence that most people harbor a slight preference for their baby's gender, and without gender selection, the desired gender is left to chance. Secondly, proponents argue that sex selection allows for better family planning. They cite that in countries with birth limitations, gender selection offers parents control over the number of children they want, particularly if they desire a specific gender for their first-born. The third argument is that sex selection contributes to family happiness and completeness. This is supported by the fact that adoption allows families with gender preferences a legal way to choose their offspring's gender. Furthermore, it's believed that parents who have the opportunity to choose their child's gender will feel more fulfilled, potentially leading to a happier family environment. Fourth, supporters suggest that sex selection can help prevent diseases in children. This is particularly relevant for diseases linked to a particular sex, where gender selection can prevent transmission of these conditions. Finally, proponents argue that sex selection could prevent abortions or infanticide, based on the evidence that gender preference can sometimes lead to the horrific act of infanticide if a child of the undesired sex is born. Sex selection could mitigate this risk."
"Opponents of this stance argue on two primary points. Firstly, they argue that flag burning is an effective tool of expression, protest, or critique. This viewpoint stems from past instances, such as the case of Gregory Lee Johnson in 1984, whose act of flag burning was deemed a form of protected expression under the First Amendment. Secondly, opponents argue that flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression. They reference court rulings, such as that of Justice William Brennan, who concluded that flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment."
"Supporters of the prohibition of flag burning put forward two main arguments. Firstly, they maintain that flags are important symbols that should be respected. They reference the historical precedence of laws against flag burning and the flag's symbolic significance, which they believe should be respected and not desecrated. Secondly, they argue that flag burning is an inflammatory act, deserving to be outlawed. They cite instances like Khalid's protest in 2003 as examples of flag burning being used to incite negativity and anti-patriotic sentiments."
"Opponents to the prohibition of women in combat argue firstly, that women and men should be equal in all respects, citing the European Union's legislative history of promoting equality between genders, and women's increased life expectancy and labor participation as evidence of progress towards equality. They assert that women are an asset in combat, citing historical examples of women successfully participating in combat roles since the Revolutionary War and studies suggesting women are not more susceptible to combat-related mental health issues than men. Further, they contend that women bring unique skills and strategies to combat, and argue that women's diverse perspectives and problem-solving abilities have proven to enhance team performance in combat situations. They cite the first two female Ranger School graduates, an Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters, and female SOE agents from World War II who performed dangerous missions with remarkable skill as examples. Moreover, they argue that women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat as men, offering historical examples of women's exceptional bravery and ability in combat, such as Maria Bochkareva's leadership of the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death in World War I, and the fact that female soldiers have fought and died in combat despite being officially barred from combat duties. In addition, they claim that women should be allowed to serve in combat if they choose to do so, arguing that women have already been unofficially serving and excelling on the battlefield. They argue that prohibitions against women serving in combat are sexist, and that women who meet the required fitness standards should be allowed to serve in combat roles, with the UK's Physical Employment Standards as an example of a gender-free fitness assessment."
"Supporters of the prohibition argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women, citing biological differences in size, bone mass, muscle density, and the ability to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. They argue that women are not able to overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers as men can, suggesting that only a small fraction of women possess the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units. Furthermore, they claim that women in combat can distract men or harm the function of the military, arguing that cultural norms about men's protective feelings towards women can cause issues in mixed-gender combat teams. They also suggest that women should serve in safer, non-combat roles, citing historical examples of women serving successfully in such roles during World War II. Lastly, they express concern about the safety and treatment of female soldiers if captured, arguing that women are less able to resist interrogation and stress, and referencing instances of female soldiers being captured and assaulted in previous wars."
Opponents of subsidizing journalism argue that government intervention could result in biased reporting or harm the objectivity of the media. They cite instances where political endorsements have been seen to create favoritism in reporting and create perceived conflicts of interest. They also reference complaints against Time Warner by the Church of Scientology that argue that subsidizing journalism could provide a safe harbor for biased journalism.
"Those advocating for the subsidization of journalism argue that this would ensure the viability, quality, and accountability of the sector. They cite the vast influx of digital information, often unverified, from blogs and comments on news stories that make it difficult to sift through information and hence, reinforce the need for professional journalism. The phenomenon of organizations like WikiLeaks filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism, they argue, is a reactionary move to decreasing funds and resources for such reporting. Supporters underscore the role of journalism in spreading accurate information and holding powers accountable, pointing to how the Associated Press has provided factual reporting on state and national events to meet the escalating demand for news. Furthermore, they highlight the increased usage of non-institutionalized, transnational information during reporting and research work, facilitated by further technological development within the internet realm. The advocates also maintain that subsidies can bolster the quality of journalism, with the International Federation of Journalists' (IFJ) Ethical Journalism Initiative in 2008 exemplifying efforts to defend standards and raise awareness about the importance of quality journalism. They also posit that subsidies can facilitate media plurality in the EU, thus encouraging democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news."
"Those opposing the subsidization of space exploration posit that the private sector, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, has demonstrated their ability to carry out successful space missions, negating the need for state-funded initiatives. They point out how SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic have accomplished feats in space travel, previously the domain of nations, such as transporting astronauts to the International Space Station and delivering cargo to low Earth orbit. Critics also underscore the high costs associated with space exploration, citing the Tsiolkovsky equation which illustrates the vast amounts of propellant needed to lift mass into orbit. Moreover, they mention the substantial costs of space travel, including the $500 to $700 million cost every time the space shuttle flies. Space exploration is argued to be scientifically useless, with the shuttle, space station, and moon/mars missions cited as examples. They even quote Bill Nye as calling space exploration a waste of time. Critics also argue that there are more pressing issues to fund than space exploration, such as poverty, and the potential dangers and resource waste associated with space missions."
"Supporters of the subsidization of space exploration argue that it paves the way for colonizing the resources and lands of other planets, with space colonies being capable of providing clean energy and new homelands for our species. They also assert that it aids in the advancement of science and technology, pointing to the significant research conducted during manned space missions, and the beneficial applications of satellite imagery and climate data in sectors like agriculture. Advocates also state that space exploration is financially beneficial, with Morgan Stanley projecting the global space industry to generate revenue of more than $1 trillion by 2040. Satellite broadband, in particular, is seen as a significant opportunity, providing internet access to under-served parts of the world and supporting the growing demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and more. They also argue that space exploration is crucial for the future survival of humanity. The development of sustainable technologies for off-world outposts is seen as instrumental for both space exploration and preserving Earth's wellbeing. Moreover, innovations from space exploration have found commercial applications, contributing to sustainability efforts. Finally, they underscore how space exploration allows us to unravel information about the universe, offering valuable data about the solar system and contributing to our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe, galaxies"
"Opponents argue a range of points. First, they contend that subsidizing vocational education diverts funds from more essential causes. They cite a 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which argues that such subsidies could detract from early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education programs. Their second argument revolves around the high cost of subsidizing vocational education. According to a 2018 report by the Center for American Progress, such programs often require significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty. Thirdly, they argue that subsidies can cause an influx in those professions, potentially saturating the market. A German study demonstrated that vocational education subsidies led to a surge in vocational program enrollments, thereby increasing the supply of skilled workers in relevant trades. Lastly, opponents suggest that vocational education is not a desirable career choice. Reports from the National Center for Education and the Economy and the American Federation of Teachers point out that vocational education programs often lack skill transferability and opportunities for career advancement, respectively."
"Proponents for subsidizing vocational education argue that such subsidies promote those with fewer resources. The National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that these subsidies improve workforce development, especially for individuals facing employment barriers. Secondly, proponents argue that vocational education better fits many students. A Georgetown University study in 2020 concluded that vocational education provides a more direct employment path, meeting current workforce needs and offering relevant education. They further argue that vocational education is a good career choice. Citing a 2022 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, supporters highlight high demand for skilled workers in industries like healthcare and technology, where vocational education can provide necessary training. Finally, supporters maintain that vocational education benefits the entire market and society. They cite a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, which found that vocational education can fill in-demand jobs, thereby benefiting the entire market and society. A report by the National Skills Coalition similarly argues that investing in vocational education can enhance social mobility by providing access to in-demand field training."
