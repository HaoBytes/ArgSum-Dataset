"The debate centers on whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offense or not. Opponents of the criminalization of assisted suicide present several arguments to support their position. Firstly, they argue that assisted suicide gives dignity to the person who wants to commit it. They cite evidence that the concept of dignity suits the intuitions that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death. Secondly, opponents argue that assisted suicide reduces suffering. They provide examples of countries where assisted suicide is legal and report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally. Thirdly, opponents argue that people should have the freedom to choose to end their life. They cite examples of countries such as the Netherlands where euthanasia, including physician-assisted suicide, is legal. Lastly, opponents argue that the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide. They provide evidence that a majority of adults believe that doctor-assisted suicide should be legal for terminally ill patients who request it. Overall, opponents of the criminalization of assisted suicide present a strong case based on the principles of dignity, reduced suffering, freedom, and benefit to the terminally ill."
"The debate topic is whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offense. The supporters of this stance have presented five claims with supporting evidence. Firstly, they argue that assisted suicide can be solicited for personal benefit, as it is only allowed for those in a state of constant and unbearable suffering. Secondly, they argue that people can still get better and therefore assisted suicide should not be allowed. Thirdly, they claim that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role as a healer and is too dangerous to make doctors agents of a patient's death. Fourthly, they argue that people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others, citing cases and statutes where assisted suicide remains illegal. Finally, they argue that people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help, and that allowing assisted suicide could lead to the acceptance of non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia."
"The opponents of banning homeschooling argue that it is often the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional, religious, ill, and disabled students. Homeschooling can be personalized to the child's pace and needs, allowing for a deeper understanding of their education progress and liberty to explore their own family's culture. Additionally, mainstream schools have a lot of violence and bullying, and parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children. The home is also a good learning environment, where students can have a more active learning experience and enjoy a broader socialization than in a typical classroom. Therefore, homeschooling should not be banned."
"The debate topic is 'Homeschooling should be banned'. Those who support the ban argue for four claims. Firstly, they argue that homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized, as evidenced by the lack of regulation in some states leading to shoddy homeschooling and potential abuse. Secondly, mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills and provide experiences such as work opportunities, sports leagues, and recognition that homeschooling cannot offer. Thirdly, mainstream schools are of higher educational quality, as the state's regulation ensures it. Fourthly, parents are not qualified as teachers and may shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse, give students a one-sided point of view, and require the parent to take on additional roles as teacher and administrator, leading to stress and fatigue. Overall, supporters of the ban on homeschooling believe that it is not a viable option for providing a quality education and may lead to potential harm to children."
"The opponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations argue that they should not be mandatory because they are dangerous and have side effects. They support this claim by citing specific examples, such as the pneumonia caused by the chickenpox vaccine and the rare possibility of Guillain-Barré Syndrome associated with the flu vaccine. Additionally, they argue that mandatory vaccinations infringe upon basic rights, such as the First Amendment of the US Constitution and the right to bodily integrity. Finally, they contend that routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy, as natural infection can provide more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations according to Mayo Clinic."
"The topic of debate is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. Those in support of mandatory vaccinations put forth the following arguments:

Firstly, routine child vaccinations are effective in preventing diseases. The evidence suggests that vaccinations have prevented millions of deaths each year worldwide, and diseases such as polio, smallpox, and diphtheria have been eliminated in the United States due to vaccinations. Additionally, vaccines have decreased the incidence of diseases like pneumococcal disease and measles by significant percentages.

Secondly, child vaccination saves lives. Vaccinations are estimated to prevent 3.5-5 million deaths per year worldwide and could save thousands of lives if all children in the US were fully vaccinated. Studies have shown that childhood immunization has prevented millions of illnesses, hospitalizations, and early deaths.

Thirdly, routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others. When the rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of diseases like measles typically no longer occur. Failure to vaccinate can lead to outbreaks that affect both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Additionally, compulsory vaccination can be seen as necessary for the public good, as shown by a landmark ruling of the US Supreme Court in 1905.

Fourthly, mandatory routine child vaccinations can prevent virus/disease spreading. Vaccination during pregnancy and among caregivers can reduce the risk of passing infections to infants, and vaccines like pertussis are effective in preventing illness. When vaccination rates are high, the incidence of outbreaks and deaths due to vaccine-preventable diseases decreases.

Lastly, children should not suffer from preventable diseases. Diseases like measles and Haemophilus influenzae can cause serious illness and even death, and vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality. Vaccine hesitancy has led to disease outbreaks and contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases worldwide.

Overall, the evidence suggests that mandatory routine child vaccinations are necessary to prevent diseases, save lives, and protect the public good."
"The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. Opponents argue against this proposition with the following claims and supporting evidence. 

Firstly, opponents argue that social media regulation is not effective. They cite examples of failed regulation such as the FTC's failure to enforce its order to protect user privacy resulting in the transfer of user data, and TikTok's violation of children's privacy laws despite paying a fine. 

Secondly, opponents argue that social media regulation harms privacy, citing examples such as the use of social media monitoring software by the government to track individuals and the DHS collecting personal information from social media to screen immigrants arriving in the US. They also argue that intervening with or removing content can lead to censorship and violate freedom of expression and privacy rights. 

Thirdly, opponents argue that social media regulation harms freedom of speech and other democratic rights, warning that regulations could threaten freedom of expression and citing examples of regulations that have jeopardized human rights. They argue that intervening with or removing content can easily lead to censorship and limit freedom of expression. 

Opponents also argue that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, citing examples of excess bureaucracy and inefficiency created by government intervention in public goods and merit goods. They argue that government intervention in the market system can cause disruptions and extend recessions or depressions. 

Lastly, opponents argue that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government. They cite examples of social media being used as an information weapon during the US 2016 election and political advertisements targeting minority communities to suppress voting and political participation. They argue that political regulation to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation is neither desirable nor feasible as any process developed to address the problem cannot be made immune to political co-optation. 

Overall, opponents argue that social media regulation by the government is not effective and can harm privacy, freedom of speech, and democratic rights. They caution against government intervention in private companies and warn against the potential political abuses that can result from social media regulation."
"The debate topic is about whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. Supporters argue that social media regulation is necessary to protect younger audiences and prevent the spread of fake news, negative content, and malicious users. Social media platforms have been found to violate the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and cause poor mental health among youth. The spread of disinformation and fake news has resulted in a lack of trust in news organizations and manipulated opinions. Pending legislation seeks to make social media platforms more transparent and outlaw manipulative techniques. Social media regulation can also help to deal with negative content and malicious users who exploit private information. Overall, social media regulation is required to protect the public and restore trust in the tech industry."
"Opponents argue that the USA is not a good country to live in due to various reasons. They claim that the US has unfair health and education policies, citing studies that show white supremacy in the school curriculum and difficulty in affording healthcare costs. Additionally, they argue that the US has a problematic and divisive political system, with increasing disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on several issues. They also point out that the US has a negative culture, where hustle culture glorifies overworking and people prioritize their social status over the dignity of others. The opponents also claim that the US has high taxation and costs of living, with families living below the poverty line taxed at a higher rate than those making more money. Furthermore, the US is unequal, with high levels of poverty and wealth concentration among the top 10% of households. Opponents argue that the US is also unsafe, with high rates of gun deaths and concerns over violent crime. Lastly, opponents claim that the US is xenophobic and racist, with racial slurs and jokes directed towards Asian Americans and daily racialized trauma experienced by middle-class Blacks in predominantly white environments."
The proponents of the topic 
"The opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy argue that it allows priests to focus on God and their spiritual life, citing evidence such as the writings of Eusebius of Caesarea and Pope Paul VI. They also argue that celibacy is a strong religious belief with a long history in the Church, as evidenced by canon law and early Christian theologians like Origen. Furthermore, they assert that celibacy makes priests appear holy and that it is a choice that they willingly make, as supported by Paul's writings. They also argue that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained and that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, as evidenced by reports linking celibacy to instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church."
"The debate topic is whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned. The supporters of abandoning celibacy present several arguments. Firstly, they argue that celibacy is outdated, as evidenced by the fact that the requirement of clerical celibacy has been removed in some instances in history. Secondly, celibacy is too pressuring and difficult, as priests and nuns who are forced to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behavior have been known to suffer. Thirdly, celibacy is unhealthy and unnatural, as it violates Biblical teachings and goes against the natural drive to reproduce. Fourthly, celibacy can lead to wrong sexual behavior, as seen in the sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church. Finally, celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests, as some may not want to take the vow of celibacy. Overall, the supporters of abandoning celibacy argue that it is an outdated and problematic practice."
The opponents of the topic 
"The proponents of abandoning marriage argue that it preserves harmful norms for women, ties people up with unfair obligations, and marriages are generally unstable. They claim that women are expected to be submissive to male family members and obey their husbands, which can result in violence or even death for not meeting these expectations. They also argue that marriages are unstable due to financial strain, having children, and changing societal expectations. Moreover, they believe that laws governing marital relations and wedding vows perpetuate women's subservience. Finally, they assert that monogamous relationships achieve most of the advantages of marriage, such as fostering emotional intimacy and reducing the risk of contracting STDs. Overall, they argue that abandoning marriage is necessary for creating more equitable and fulfilling relationships."
"The opponents of the proposition argue that school uniforms should not be abandoned. They support their argument with five claims. First, they claim that children can still express themselves using other means, such as buttons or jewelry, as uniforms do not silence voices. Second, they argue that school uniforms reduce bullying, as uniforms make it harder for bullies to identify their targets. Third, they believe that school uniforms create a sense of equality and unity, as they promote unity and equality and boost school pride and spirit. Fourth, school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning, as students in uniforms are more focused in their academics, which also helps to minimize disciplinary problems. Finally, they argue that school uniforms save costs, as the cost of a year's worth of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is less than the cost of non-school outfits. The opponents provide evidence to support their claims, such as research findings, surveys, and statistics."
"The debate topic is on whether schools should abandon the use of school uniforms. Supporters of the stance that school uniforms should be abandoned put forward several arguments to support their position. Firstly, they argue that school uniforms harm learning and creativity. They argue that uniforms send the message that conformity is more important than creativity, and students are not allowed to express themselves. Secondly, they argue that school uniforms harm students' self-expression, which goes against the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Studies have also shown that students from schools without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools that forced students to wear uniforms. Thirdly, supporters of this stance argue that school uniforms are expensive, with the average cost of a school uniform being £340, and 95 percent of parents thinking that school uniforms cost too much. Fourthly, school uniforms are often uncomfortable and sexist, especially for female students, and they contribute to building a culture that is hostile to girls. Lastly, supporters argue that school uniforms increase conformity and harm individuality, which does not prepare students for adulthood. Overall, supporters of the stance that school uniforms should be abandoned believe that uniforms are detrimental to students' development and freedom of expression."
"The opponents of abolishing capital punishment argue that it helps the victims and their families find closure and justice, as well as serving as a deterrent for potential murderers. They believe that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes. The evidence presented includes statements from Henry McMaster, the Governor of South Carolina, and Leslie Rutledge, the Attorney General of Arkansas, emphasizing the importance of the death penalty in providing closure and deterring crime. Additionally, Charles Stimson, the Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, argues that the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. Furthermore, studies from researchers such as Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd demonstrate that capital punishment deters murder rates and provides a significant benefit to society."
"The proponents of abolishing capital punishment make several arguments. First, they argue that state-sanctioned killing is fundamentally wrong, as it violates human rights and can never be undone. This is supported by evidence that the death penalty is often applied unfairly and arbitrarily, with people of color and those with lower incomes more likely to be sentenced to death. Additionally, mistakes can be made, with innocent people being sentenced to death. Second, they argue that the death penalty harms the disenfranchised, as it diverts resources away from other programs that could better increase public safety, health, and welfare. Moreover, it has no public safety benefit and is not a deterrent to crime, as evidenced by the fact that murder rates are often higher in states that have the death penalty. Finally, they argue that the death penalty is irreversible, as there is no way to undo the harm it causes. Overall, the proponents of abolishing capital punishment believe that it is a cruel, ineffective, and ultimately unjust practice that should be abolished."
"The opponents argue against the abolition of intellectual property rights and present four main claims. Firstly, they claim that intellectual property rights incentivize creativity and innovation, citing evidence such as the WIPO treaty, which emphasizes the protection of intellectual property rights as crucial for economic growth. Secondly, they claim that intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products, with economists arguing that without such protections, there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organizations to produce intangible assets. Thirdly, they argue that intellectual property rights protect against stealing, with IPR treating intellectual property as a real property subject to analogous protections. Lastly, they claim that people or businesses own their innovations and should be compensated for their endeavors, with intellectual property rights providing a financial incentive for the creation and investment in intellectual property. The opponents conclude that intellectual property rights should not be abolished."
"The proponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that these rights hinder the progress and innovation of services and products. They claim that intellectual property restricts access to important information and products and is unfair. Additionally, they argue that these rights harm creativity and innovation and waste money, as they are ineffective. Evidence supporting these claims includes examples such as the increased duration of copyrights, the poorly defined conduct that could lead to criminal liability, and the negative impact on indigenous peoples' rights. Other evidence includes criticisms that these rights limit freedom of speech and press, discourage research and development, and do not align with libertarian principles. The proponents suggest that the concept of intellectual property is a legal fiction created by the state and that there are better alternatives to encourage innovation and progress."
"The opponents of abolishing the right to keep and bear arms make the following arguments: 
Firstly, gun control is ineffective as criminals tend to obtain their firearms through illegal channels, and state and federal laws do not deter them. Additionally, studies have shown that most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates. 
Secondly, gun ownership is a right that stems from the natural right to self-defense and the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. The Supreme Court has also repeatedly affirmed the individual's right to possess firearms for self-defense. 
Thirdly, gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports shooting, as millions of Americans engage in these activities and spend billions on hunting and shooting equipment. 
Lastly, gun ownership promotes self-protection as it deters criminals from committing crimes and helps to insure domestic tranquility and provide for common defense. These arguments are backed by studies, surveys, and legal precedents."
"The debate topic is 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', and the supporters of this stance have put forward four claims. Firstly, they argue that banning guns would save lives, citing several pieces of evidence to support this claim. For example, guns are the leading cause of death by homicide and suicide, and a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that firearms were the second leading cause of deaths for children. Additionally, legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death, and where guns are more available, there are more homicides. 

Secondly, the supporters argue that gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence. They present evidence such as the fact that the average gun owner is not trained in law enforcement or handling life-threatening situations, and increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation. Additionally, gun-inflicted deaths often ensue from impromptu arguments and fights, and guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance. 

Thirdly, the supporters argue that guns can fall into the wrong hands, and present evidence such as almost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction, and that 37.4% of state prison inmates who “used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence” obtained the gun from a family member or friend. They also cite the example of the Sutherland Springs church massacre where the perpetrator's domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns. 

Finally, the supporters argue that guns lead to accidental deaths, citing evidence such as states with the highest concentration of guns having nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths, and that most unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence. They also note that adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, and victims of unintentional shootings are three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm."
"The opponents of adopting an austerity regime argue that it would be detrimental for society. The first claim is that austerity cuts access to essential services, with evidence showing that local authority budgets were cut by almost a third from 2010 to 2018, resulting in closures of public services like Sure Start centers and libraries. Austerity has also led to rising child poverty and an increase in food bank usage. The second claim is that austerity extends recessions, with evidence showing that it has contractionary effects and exacerbates economic recessions, leading to high-level government officials resigning in countries like Argentina, Russia, and Turkey. The third claim is that austerity is unfair to citizens, with evidence showing that it breaches four UN human rights agreements relating to women, children, disabled people, and economic and social rights, leading to high levels of child poverty, despite the UK being the world's fifth-largest economy. The fourth claim is that austerity results in lower growth, with evidence showing that it strangles economic recovery and undermines improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, resulting in lower pay growth and living standards. The fifth and final claim is that austerity results in lower job creation, with evidence showing that cutting government spending leads to large-scale unemployment, particularly affecting vulnerable groups like women and those living in countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain."
"The supporters of adopting an austerity regime argue that it has several benefits. Firstly, austerity can lead to improvements in economic measures as shown by Canada's fiscal deficit reduction while maintaining strong economic growth and Latvia's rebound in economic growth. Secondly, austerity is important in the long term as it gives investors greater confidence about the economy's long-term performance, reduces budget deficits, and encourages the private sector to invest. Thirdly, austerity is important to increase stability as seen in Morocco's steady growth, low inflation rates, and fall in unemployment due to austerity measures and pro-market reforms. Fourthly, austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts, as exceeding a debt-to-GDP ratio of 77% slows economic growth. Finally, austerity regimes are essential in economically troubled times as seen in the US between 1920 and 1921, the UK, Greece, and Spain during the global economic downturn of 2008. Overall, the benefits of austerity outweigh the negative consequences in the long term."
"The opponents of adopting atheism argue that it violates freedom of religion and discriminates against religious people. They cite examples such as John Locke, who believed that denying God's existence would lead to social chaos, and the Albanian Constitution, which supported atheistic propaganda and imposed prison sentences for religious propaganda. They also argue that atheism lacks morality, as belief is necessary for individuals to give a coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life. However, they acknowledge that people should have the freedom to choose their beliefs, as demonstrated by the European Court of Human Rights' ruling that individuals cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behavior associated with a particular religion. Ultimately, the decision to adopt atheism or not is a matter of personal choice."
"The supporters of atheism argue that we should adopt atheism because it is beneficial to the person that adopts it. They claim that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, allowing for the evaluation of morality without being constrained by religious imperatives. They also argue that being an atheist leads to fewer conflicting ideas and more satisfaction at heart. Additionally, they argue that atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists. They provide several pieces of evidence, including the argument that belief in God is inherently irrational because it is not observable and that there is no evidence for God's existence. Furthermore, they argue that religions are immoral, with some religions teaching people to do horrible things. Finally, they claim that science can adequately explain the Universe, which can lead to intellectual fulfillment for atheists."
"The opponents argue that adopting libertarianism is not desirable for society. They present several claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that libertarianism harms economic growth as it can result in corporate capitalism, economic inequality, and laws that suppress economic growth. Additionally, they argue that libertarianism harms minorities and those who are worse off, as it can lead to consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, which reject the notion of inalienable rights. Moreover, they assert that libertarianism is unjust and non-equal because it prioritizes individual freedom and property rights over social equality and the common good. Furthermore, they contend that libertarianism removes essential laws, infrastructure, and government services, which can be harmful to society. Finally, they argue that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens, such as basic human rights and protection of the environment."
"The debate topic is whether we should adopt libertarianism or not. Supporters of the adoption of libertarianism argue that it has several benefits. Firstly, they claim that libertarianism increases economic growth. Advocates of libertarianism suggest that free-market roads are more efficient, safer, and cost-effective than public roads. Additionally, reduced taxation can lead to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity. Secondly, they argue that libertarianism increases freedom in the political system by limiting the role of the government in society. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. Thirdly, they assert that libertarianism increases happiness and fulfillment. By allowing individuals to make their own decisions, they are better able to pursue their interests and goals. Fourthly, supporters argue that libertarianism increases individual freedom and liberties by promoting private charity, tolerating diverse lifestyles, supporting the free market, and defending civil liberties. Overall, supporters argue that adopting libertarianism can lead to economic growth, political freedom, individual fulfillment, and greater individual freedom and liberties."
"The opponents of banning human cloning argue that it should not be banned due to several reasons. Firstly, cloning can be used for organ replication, which can help to reduce the shortage of organs available for transplantation. Additionally, cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs, improve the quality of life for people with certain medical conditions, and reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. Secondly, cloning can help those who can’t otherwise have a child by creating a child who is genetically related to one of the parents and free of genetic diseases that are present in one of the parents. Thirdly, cloning promotes health by providing a source of organs for those in need of transplants, developing gene therapies for a range of diseases, and producing stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases. Finally, cloning promotes science/research by advancing medical science, developing new therapies for a range of diseases, and advancing biotechnology."
"The debate topic is whether human cloning should be banned. The positive supporters of this stance present four claims as follows: 

First, cloning is not understood enough yet, and its potential for creating ethical and societal problems is a concern. This is supported by evidence 1, which argues that repugnance towards cloning is a form of deep wisdom that modern ethical discourse fails to provide, and evidence 2, which suggests that cloning could lead to the creation of monsters and other dislocations. 

Second, cloning is unethical and anti-religious, and goes against notions of human dignity. Evidence 1 states that cloning is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited, while evidence 2 argues that reproductive human cloning infringes on human dignity. Evidence 3 also presents the concerns of Christian ethicists who argue that cloning creates issues of identity and individuality, and the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and its Additional Protocol to the Convention appear to ban cloning human beings. 

Third, cloning is unnatural and goes against the natural order. This is supported by evidence 1, which states that much of the concern stems from a fear of overstepping natural bounds, and evidence 2, which presents the perspective of a Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist who believes that humans should only be created by acts of love between two people. 

Fourth, cloning is unsafe and can result in health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death. Evidence 2, 3, 4, and 5 all present studies that report low success rates for cloning animals, health problems for cloned organisms, and unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences. 

Overall, the supporters of banning human cloning present a range of ethical, societal, religious, and safety concerns that suggest that cloning should be prohibited until further research and understanding can mitigate these concerns."
"The opponents argue that we should not ban private military companies because of the financial benefits they provide. According to a report by the Congressional Research Service in 2009, private military companies can result in cost savings for the government compared to using traditional military personnel. Moreover, private military companies can provide more efficient services compared to traditional military personnel due to their ability to quickly respond to changing circumstances, according to a study published in the journal Defense and Security Analysis in 2011. Additionally, private military companies offer greater flexibility in terms of hiring and deploying personnel, allowing the government to respond quickly to changing circumstances, as per a report by the Heritage Foundation in 2010.

The opponents also argue that private military companies are well-trained and better equipped. According to a report by the Heritage Foundation in 2010, private military companies typically require their personnel to have high levels of training and experience, often exceeding the requirements for traditional military personnel. Furthermore, private military companies often have access to state-of-the-art equipment, allowing them to carry out their operations with greater efficiency and effectiveness, as per a study published in the journal Defense and Security Analysis in 2011.

In addition, the opponents argue that private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies cannot, or do not want, to do. Private military companies often have expertise in unconventional warfare and other specialized areas, providing the government with a valuable resource in these areas, according to a study published in the journal International Affairs in 2010. Moreover, private military companies can carry out sensitive missions, such as covert operations, freeing up regular army personnel to focus on other tasks, as per a report by the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2007.

Finally, the opponents argue that private military companies increase safety. Private military companies can provide improved security in conflict zones, reducing the risk of harm to both military personnel and civilians, according to a study published in the journal Defense and Security Analysis in 2011. Additionally, private military companies can provide more efficient use of resources, reducing the overall cost of military operations and allowing for a greater focus on safety, as per a report by the Heritage Foundation in 2010."
"Private military companies (PMCs) have been under scrutiny for their operations and practices, leading to a growing belief that they should be banned. Supporters of this stance have put forth several arguments to support their claims. Firstly, PMCs are less ethical and more likely to commit crimes, as evidenced by several reports from Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the United Nations. Additionally, PMCs are not considered professional due to their lack of accountability and transparency, poor training of personnel, and unclear chain of command. Furthermore, there is a lack of trust in the loyalty of PMCs to the hiring country due to a conflict of interest between the interests of the client and the country. The main interest of PMCs is profit, as seen in their prioritization of profit over ethical and legal considerations and the unregulated nature of the industry. Finally, PMCs can solicit, engage, or prolong conflicts due to their financial incentive to do so and encourage militarization of conflicts. In conclusion, supporters argue that PMCs should be banned to prevent unethical practices, lack of accountability, and financial motivations for conflict."
"The debate topic is about banning the use of child actors. The opponents present several claims to argue against this ban. First, acting may be a child's dream, and studies have shown that some children have a natural talent for acting or may be influenced by celebrity culture to pursue acting. Second, child performers achieve success and confidence in their abilities, as evidenced by awards received by child actors. Third, child performers are necessary for certain roles and can provide more diversity in casting, audience engagement, and character development. Fourth, child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation to ensure their safety and well-being. Finally, the decision to allow a child to act should be made by their parents, who have the right to autonomy and decision-making authority for their children. While there are valid concerns about the safety and well-being of child actors, these opponents argue that a ban is not the solution and that the industry can instead work to provide more protection and regulation for child performers."
"The supporters of banning the use of child actors present multiple claims to support their stance. Firstly, child performers often miss school or receive inadequate education, leading to a lack of basic skills and knowledge. Secondly, child performers are at risk of exploitation due to long work hours, lack of oversight, and the vulnerability associated with their age. Thirdly, child performers lose their childhood as they spend most of their time working and rehearsing. Fourthly, child performers face a lot of pressure due to tight production schedules and the pressure to perform, leading to negative impacts on their mental health. Lastly, child performers tend to develop problems later in life due to the stressful environment to which they are subjected. These claims are supported by various studies and reports, including those published in the Journal of Education and Practice, American Academy of Pediatrics, Journal of Youth and Adolescence, American Psychological Association, Journal of Pediatrics, UNICEF, and National Child Traumatic Stress Network."
"The opponents of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp argue that it would harm national security. They present evidence that the remaining detainees are hardened terrorists, and transferring them to another country could risk national security. Furthermore, approximately 17.5 percent of former detainees transferred to other countries have reengaged in terrorist activities. The camp is also necessary for detaining high-value enemy combatants who pose a continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the United States. 

They also argue that the camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives. The facility provides humane treatment, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world. It is also a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security, and medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world.

Lastly, the opponents argue that the camp is essential to gain intelligence. The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. Transferring terrorists from the camp would hinder the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts operations. It is also the single greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror. Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility. Therefore, the opponents of closing the camp argue that it is crucial to national security, humane treatment, and intelligence gathering."
"The debate topic is whether or not Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed. The positive supporters have presented six claims as their arguments. Firstly, they argue that detainees have the right to trial in US courts, as evidenced by the Supreme Court ruling in Boumediene v. Bush. Secondly, they contend that Guantanamo Bay harms the US image, reputation, and institutions, and is a recruitment tool for terrorists. Thirdly, they argue that the detention camp is a symbol of discrimination and injustice, both domestically and internationally. Fourthly, they maintain that the detention camp is expensive, with a current cost of over $6 billion to operate. Fifthly, they claim that personnel at the detention camp commit crimes against the prisoners, including torture and arbitrary detention. Finally, they argue that the tactics used at Guantanamo Bay are unjust and include physical abuse, isolation, and deprivation of sensory stimuli, among others."
"The opponents of ending affirmative action argue that it should be continued due to the following reasons:
Firstly, affirmative action programs have been proven to increase diversity and improve access for underrepresented groups. Several studies have documented important gains in racial and gender equality as a direct result of affirmative action. For instance, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in the likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect. Furthermore, almost 70 major US companies warned that without affirmative action, they’ll lose access to “a pipeline of highly qualified future workers and business leaders” and will struggle to meet diversity hiring goals they’ve set. Therefore, ending affirmative action would hamper the progress made towards a more diverse and equal society.
Secondly, affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past. These programs have brought significant gains for women and minorities, with black participation in the workforce increasing by 50 percent in the past 25 years and the percentage of blacks holding managerial positions jumping fivefold. Affirmative action helps to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future. It is a meaningful remedy when there is strong evidence of prolonged and systemic discrimination by organizations. Therefore, ending affirmative action would be a step back in the progress made towards combating discrimination and promoting equal opportunities.
Lastly, affirmative action reduces discrimination. Affirmative action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95% to 97% of the high-level corporate jobs, and that’s with affirmative action programs in place. Therefore, without affirmative action, the figures would be even lower. Affirmative action provides positive preferential treatment in the allotment of jobs and access to higher education, as a means to accelerate the integration of the socially and economically disadvantaged groups with mainstream society. Hence, ending affirmative action would increase discrimination against already marginalized groups and hamper efforts to achieve a more diverse and equal society."
"The supporters of ending affirmative action make several arguments. First, they argue that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities. Opponents believe that it devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it is supposed to help, and some argue that it is ineffective and not just. Affirmative action is also claimed to perpetuate prejudice and reduce quality, as race-based affirmative action programs sweep systemic problems under the carpet. For instance, Clint Bolick claims that it perpetuates fraud upon the very groups it is designed to help, while Williams argues that it is harmful to minorities and stifles their ability to advance in society. Therefore, the proponents of ending affirmative action believe that it is not a solution to a deeper issue in the American education system and that it should be eliminated."
"The opponents argue that we should not end mandatory retirement. They support their argument with two claims. Firstly, they claim that mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers. According to various studies and reports such as the OECD, National Bureau of Economic Research, International Labour Organization, World Economic Forum, and International Monetary Fund, mandatory retirement ages can increase job mobility, encourage older workers to retire, boost employment for young people, promote intergenerational equity, and stimulate economic growth. All of these factors lead to younger workers being given more opportunities to enter the workforce and build their careers. Secondly, opponents claim that mandatory retirement age benefits those that are about to be retired. The Employee Benefit Research Institute found that mandatory retirement ages can increase financial security for workers as they can receive pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a specified age."
"The supporters of ending mandatory retirement argue that it is beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, mandatory retirement decreases institutional knowledge. Secondly, mandatory retirement harms the economy as it reduces labor force participation, decreases productivity, and leads to an inefficient use of human capital. Thirdly, mandatory retirement is not fair and can result in age discrimination. Fourthly, mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, as it can lead to decreased physical and cognitive function, economic well-being, psychological well-being, social connections, and feelings of loneliness. Finally, the supporters argue that everyone should be allowed to retire when they are ready as it promotes well-being, individual choice, intergenerational collaboration, active aging, and reduces the risk of poverty in old age."
"The opponents of fighting for the abolition of nuclear weapons argue that these weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. They claim that nuclear deterrence has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years. The evidence supporting this argument includes the fact that the invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. Additionally, the possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory."
"The proponents of the abolition of nuclear weapons have presented two main claims to support their stance. Firstly, nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands, as evidenced by the large amount of weapons-usable nuclear material that is spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries worldwide. This poses a significant risk of nuclear terrorism, which has increased since September 2011, and could result in catastrophic consequences that would change our lives forever. Additionally, there is a risk of accidents, errors, or the possibility of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the wrong hands to avoid such disastrous outcomes.

Secondly, the proponents argue that nuclear weapons provoke or escalate disastrous military action, as evidenced by past events. For example, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings almost led to a nuclear war. Similarly, recent events, such as the war in Ukraine, have seen the threat of the use of nuclear weapons being made. In such scenarios, even a single nuclear warning shot could result in more than 91 million people being killed or injured within three hours. Therefore, the use of nuclear weapons must be avoided, and their abolition should be pursued to prevent such catastrophic outcomes."
"The opponents argue that urbanization is beneficial and should not be fought against. They claim that urbanization offers more opportunities for people, which motivates migration to urban areas. They provide evidence such as deficient urban planning, densely condensed urbanization, and poverty as ongoing problems that create an opportunity for sustainability with the potential to use resources more efficiently, to create more sustainable land use, and to protect the biodiversity of natural ecosystems. Additionally, opponents argue that urbanization benefits the economy with evidence such as urbanization being a means of stimulating economic growth, generating revenue, and encouraging the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries. They also argue that urbanization benefits the environment with evidence such as urbanization driving innovation, including green technologies, and reducing the ecological footprint. Overall, the opponents argue that urbanization offers numerous benefits and should not be fought against."
"The debate topic is 'We should fight urbanization'. The positive supporters argue that urbanization has negative consequences, including economic decline, increased crime, harm to the environment, and resource strain. They present several claims and evidence to support their argument. Firstly, they claim that restrictions on migration would benefit people in rural areas economically and socially. They provide evidence that shows the decline of agrarian production and governmental neglect leading to economic disinvestment and depopulation in Venezuela, among other examples. Secondly, they argue that urbanization causes crime, and provide evidence that supports this claim, including rising crime rates during the period of industrialization and a rise in urban crime, poverty, and health problems in Māori communities. Thirdly, they assert that urbanization harms the environment, and cite evidence of increased energy demand and emissions of air pollutants, which may affect plant metabolism, and an increase in sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters, among other negative effects. Finally, they claim that urbanization is causing a strain on cities' resources, citing examples such as increasing numbers of squatters, traffic congestion, inadequate housing, and insufficient access to educational facilities. Overall, the positive supporters argue that we should fight urbanization to address these negative consequences."
"The opponents of compulsory voting argue that abstaining from voting is a way to exercise one's right to vote and can reflect one's preferences. They argue that citizens have a right not to vote, as compulsory voting violates freedom of speech and civil liberties. Compulsory voting can also cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, leading to a dampened voice of the majority. Additionally, not everyone has the ability to go and vote, as evidenced by the lack of basic knowledge about the Constitution and intentional disinformation."
"The debate topic is 'We should introduce compulsory voting.' The positive supporters of this argument present three main claims. Firstly, compulsory voting increases representation. Studies have found that it reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement and increases support for leftist policy positions. It also ensures that candidates address the needs of all voters and prevents the political system from being skewed towards the well-off and well-educated. Secondly, compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. This is evident from the higher turnout in places like the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, where compulsory voting is enforced. It also increases the legitimacy of elected representatives and increases the political education of the people. Thirdly, people have an obligation to vote. Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, and mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms. Furthermore, voting is one of our most important rights, and those who don't vote are taking that right for granted. Overall, the positive supporters argue that introducing compulsory voting will increase representation, political engagement, and fulfill people's obligation to vote."
"The opponents of legalizing cannabis put forward several arguments against it. Firstly, they argue that cannabis harms the body. Dutch research has shown that higher THC content increases the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, especially among younger or inexperienced smokers. Additionally, chronic smoking of marijuana can change blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Secondly, opponents argue that cannabis increases lack of judgement and accidents. Studies have found that acute cannabis use increases the risk of automobile crashes, and deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the US over the past two decades. Thirdly, opponents argue that cannabis is a gateway drug and addictive. Research has found that THC alters the opioid system associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates and can lead to abuse of other illicit drugs. Finally, opponents argue that legalizing cannabis can make it more accessible to underage teenagers and children, which has been proven in the case of Alaska. They also argue that legalizing cannabis will boost black-market and criminal activity, as seen in the recent illegal cannabis busts in California."
"The supporters of legalizing cannabis present several arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that alcohol and tobacco, which are more harmful drugs, remain legal. Evidence shows that these legal drugs have caused over half a million deaths annually, while cannabis has only been the cause of a few deaths. Additionally, legalizing cannabis would reduce crime and save billions of dollars that are currently spent on prohibition enforcement. 

Secondly, legalizing cannabis could benefit the economy by generating tax revenues and reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement. According to a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, a taxed and regulated cannabis market in the UK would save the exchequer £6.7 billion. 

Thirdly, cannabis is relatively safe and has been shown to have medical benefits. There are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans, and the Institute of Medicine has stated that cannabis does have medical benefits. 

Fourthly, if cannabis was legalized, it could be regulated, reducing black-market activity, and criminal behavior. Legalizing cannabis would decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking, which is a significant contributor to drug-related crime costs. 

Fifthly, legalizing cannabis could reduce drug-related violence and improve public health. The drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence, and alternative models for drug control may be necessary. Finally, supporters argue that people should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies, citing the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill."
"Opponents of legalizing prostitution argue that it will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, increase immoral behavior such as pimping, organized crime and trafficking, increase violence against women, and that selling one's body is immoral. Evidence supporting these claims includes the fact that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population, that legalizing prostitution would result in an increase in human trafficking and crime, and that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce. Additionally, many feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client."
"The debate topic is whether or not prostitution should be legalized. Supporters of legalizing prostitution have presented multiple arguments. First, legalizing prostitution boosts the economy as it is a necessary profession in big cities and can generate taxable income. Second, legalizing prostitution increases benefits for sex workers such as health care, safe sex, and unionization. Third, legalization allows for regulation of the profession and promotes consistent condom use to reduce sexually transmitted diseases. Fourth, legalizing prostitution makes the profession safer for women by reducing violence and promoting harm reduction policies. Lastly, supporters argue that sex work is a valid choice over one's body, which should not be prohibited by the government. Overall, supporters believe that decriminalizing and legalizing prostitution would provide benefits and improve the safety and well-being of sex workers."
"The opponents argue against legalizing sex selection. Firstly, they claim that sex selection can lead to gender imbalance, which is evident in countries like China and India where son preference has caused a significant decline in the number of girls born. This can lead to social unrest and wars. Secondly, sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases. It is a result of cultural preference for sons, which has persisted in traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy. Thirdly, sex selection will create abortions and infanticide. It allows parents to abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child and can result in neglect of girls and female infanticide, as seen in China under the one-child policy. Although sex-selective abortions were banned in China in 2006, repeat abortions are still common among women with no sons. Legalizing sex selection would perpetuate these issues and is therefore not advisable."
"The debate is on whether sex selection should be legalized or not. The positive supporters of the idea argue that legalizing sex selection will provide several benefits. Firstly, it will be within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child. The desire to have a daughter or son is prevalent in most people, and sex selection can fulfill this desire. Additionally, choosing baby's gender can help in instilling some gender balance in the family, allows for smart shopping during the trimesters, and can prevent gender-specific diseases from being passed onto a baby.

Secondly, sex selection allows for better family planning. Parents can choose the number of children they want and the gender of the baby, ensuring they raise just an adequate number of children and can provide them with good education and proper nutrition. Moreover, sex selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father's family name.

Thirdly, sex selection makes the family more happy/complete. Adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex. For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option. It is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire.

Fourthly, sex selection prevents diseases in the child. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases.

Finally, sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide. Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females. Legalizing sex selection will give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer, preventing the need for abortions or infanticide."
"Opponents of prohibiting flag burning argue that it is a form of expression, protest, and critique that is protected under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. They cite several cases, including Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District and Texas v. Johnson, where courts have ruled that symbolic speech, including burning the flag, is a protected form of expression. They argue that the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution means that there is no separate juridical category for the American flag alone. They also contend that freedom of expression justifies flag burning, as the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive or disagreeable."
"The debate topic is whether or not flag burning should be prohibited. The positive supporters argue that flags are important symbols that should be respected, and that flag burning is an inflammatory act. In support of the first claim, they provide evidence such as the fact that some countries have laws against flag burning, and that the United States had state laws against flag desecration by 1932. They also argue that prohibiting flag burning would be consistent with the views of legal scholars such as Warren and Black. In support of the second claim, they argue that flag burning is often done to provoke a reaction rather than to express a particular idea, and that it is therefore an act of aggression rather than free speech. They also point to examples of flag burning being used as a form of anti-American protest. Overall, the supporters of the prohibition of flag burning believe that it is an act that is disrespectful to the flag and to the nation it represents."
"The opponents of the proposition argue that women should not be prohibited from combat for the following reasons:

Firstly, gender equality is a human right and is good for the economy. Increasing women's participation in the economy is good for the economy, and everyone benefits from gender equality. Secondly, women are an asset in combat. They have unique skills and strategies, and their performance has equaled and often surpassed that of their male counterparts. Thirdly, women can create unique skills/strategies. In some combat positions, only female service members are equipped to address security risks posed by Afghan women on patrols. Fourthly, women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat. Women have always proudly served in the military in different capacities and performed critical jobs. Lastly, women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to, and they should be accepted as long as they pass the tests. Women have already been unofficially serving in the battlefield, excelling, and providing invaluable insight to their command teams. As long as women qualify and meet the standards, they should be allowed to contribute to the mission in ways they could not before."
"The debate topic is whether women should be prohibited in combat. Those in favor of the proposition present five claims. Firstly, they argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women due to physical differences such as less muscle density and bone mass. Secondly, they claim that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers and cite lower physical fitness standards and higher injury rates. Thirdly, they suggest that women in combat can distract and harm military function by hurting unit morale and cohesion, fostering fraternization, and inciting jealousy or resentment. Fourthly, they propose that women should serve in safer roles such as clerks and nurses, similar to their non-combat roles during World War II. Finally, they argue that women soldier capture is a big concern due to women's perceived lack of mental resilience and resistance to fatigue, as well as their vulnerability to rape. Overall, the supporters of the proposition believe that women in combat would negatively impact military effectiveness and the safety of female soldiers."
"The opponents of subsidizing journalism argue that government intervention risks inserting bias and harming objectivity in journalism. They provide several examples of complaints of biased reporting in news media and the potential for political endorsements to create conflicts of interest. Additionally, opponents argue that subsidies for journalism would be better spent elsewhere and that journalism should be treated like any other business, with the expectation that if it is not sustainable, it should fail. They further argue that the federal government cannot afford to bail out newspapers and should not be burdened with the responsibility of supporting media companies."
"The debate topic is about subsidizing journalism. The positive supporters argue that subsidies are necessary for making journalism viable, improving the quality of journalism, increasing objectivity in reporting, and spreading information and accountability. They provide various pieces of evidence to support these claims. Firstly, the European Court of Human Rights emphasizes that journalistic sources' protection is essential to ensure press freedom. Secondly, the increasing amount of information on digital platforms makes it challenging to sift through and require more subsidies to secure the financial viability of media markets. Thirdly, journalism is crucial to maintaining community quality of life and that state subsidies become more critical in times of crisis like the pandemic. Fourthly, education in journalism empowers the public to understand how media works, and subsidies can improve the quality of journalism. Finally, peace journalism can help expose violent groups' attempts to promote violence by presenting anomalous local perspectives, leading to objectivity in reporting. Overall, subsidizing journalism can contribute to better informing the public, accountability, and democratic decision-making."
"The opponents of subsidizing space exploration argue that the private sector can carry out space exploration, as evidenced by companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic. These companies have achieved key feats in space travel, transported astronauts to the International Space Station, and delivered cargo to low Earth orbit. Moreover, space exploration is expensive, costing billions of dollars each year, and relies on chemical propulsion, making it difficult to reduce costs. Additionally, opponents argue that space exploration is ineffective, and missions to other planets and interstellar space do not contribute to life on our planet, with the Apollo missions being scientifically useless. Finally, opponents argue that there are more important issues to fund, such as poverty, global warming, reducing crime rates, and finding a cure for cancer and Alzheimer's disease."
"The debate topic is whether we should subsidize space exploration. The positive supporters argue that space exploration has multiple benefits, including colonizing resources on other planets, improving science and technology, financial benefits, necessary for the future survival of humanity, and unraveling information about the universe. 

One of the main benefits of space exploration is the potential for colonizing resources on other planets, which can supply clean energy, new homelands, and an expanded ecological niche for humans. It can also provide a new future for our children. 

Space exploration can also improve science and technology by acting as a catalyst for the development of new technologies, and research in basic sciences. In addition, satellite imagery and climate data support sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. 

Furthermore, space exploration is financially beneficial and can create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. The global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. 

Another important aspect of space exploration is that it is necessary for the future survival of humanity, as innovations from space exploration can help us harness a more sustainable world. For instance, technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air, and more can be utilized on Earth as well. 

Lastly, space exploration unravels information about the universe, which is essential to top-level science and the answers to many fundamental scientific questions. The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems. 

Therefore, based on these arguments and evidence, subsidizing space exploration is crucial as it has multiple benefits that can improve human life, our economy, and ensure the future survival of humanity."
"Proponents of subsidizing vocational education argue that it is a worthy cause, but opponents have put forward several claims to the contrary. Firstly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more important programs, such as early childhood education and higher education. This claim is supported by several pieces of evidence, including studies by the Urban Institute and the National Bureau of Economic Research. Secondly, opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education is expensive and can compete with other priorities for funding and resources. This claim is supported by evidence from the Center for American Progress and the National Conference of State Legislatures. Thirdly, opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions, as seen in Germany and Switzerland. Finally, opponents argue that vocational education is not a good career choice, as it often leads to low-wage jobs with limited opportunities for advancement. This claim is supported by evidence from the National Skills Coalition and the American Federation of Teachers."
"The supporters of subsidizing vocational education argue that it has several benefits. First, it promotes those with fewer resources by increasing access for low-income students and improving workforce development for individuals who face barriers to employment. Second, vocational education better fits the learning styles and interests of many students, provides a more direct path to employment, and offers customized learning experiences. Third, vocational education is a good career choice, as it provides training and education in in-demand fields and individuals with vocational education have higher earning potential. Fourth, vocational education is beneficial for the entire market and society by addressing workforce shortages, boosting economic growth, increasing workforce productivity, enhancing social mobility, and promoting workforce diversity. These arguments are supported by various reports, studies, and evidence from reputable organizations such as the National Skills Coalition, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Therefore, subsidizing vocational education can have a positive impact on individuals, the workforce, and society as a whole."
