"The opponents of the stance that assisted suicide should be a criminal offense argue that it provides dignity to those who wish to control their death. The group Dignity in Dying asserts that the current laws offer no protection for those who want to end their lives and that many people travel abroad before they are ready to die due to fear of becoming too weak to make the journey. They argue that terminally ill individuals should have the right to medical assistance in ending their lives, subject to prescribed safeguards. They further argue that legalizing assisted suicide reduces the suffering of those who are experiencing unbearable and hopeless pain. People should have the freedom to choose to end their life, and if a person does not want to take advantage of this option, it is their personal choice. Finally, the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide, as it provides an alternative to terminal sedation with the loss of consciousness when no other way can relieve the pain or suffering of a dying patient."
"The debate topic is whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offence. Supporters of this stance argue that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role as a healer and that people do not have the right to self-harm or harm others. They also argue that people who are ill may not have clear judgment and are in need of help. Evidence supporting these claims includes statements from Dr. Lynda Young, MD, who believes physician-assisted suicide is incompatible with a doctor's role as a healer, and the State of New York's prohibition against physician-assisted suicide. The New Zealand Medical Association also opposes voluntary euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide, while any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted. Finally, studies from the Netherlands fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the non-voluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others. The slippery slope argument is also applied to the euthanasia debate, claiming that the acceptance of certain practices will lead to the acceptance of concepts that are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia."
"The debate is on whether homeschooling should be banned. Those who oppose the ban argue that homeschooling is often the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students. Evidence shows that homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, young athletes, and actors who are taught at home. Additionally, homeschooling can be personalized to the child's pace and needs, which mainstream schools often fail to meet, leading to unhappy parents. Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs, alcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality that is prevalent in mainstream schools. They believe that parents should be allowed to choose the education of their children, giving them a deeper understanding of their children's education progress and the liberty to explore their own family's culture. Lastly, unschoolers argue that the home is a good learning environment, citing studies that show home-educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers because of the wide range of people with which they communicate. Therefore, banning homeschooling would deprive parents and children of the benefits that come with homeschooling."
"The debate topic is whether homeschooling should be banned. Supporters of the ban argue that homeschooling cannot be standardized or regulated, which can lead to potential abuse or neglect. They argue that mainstream schools are essential for the development of social skills and offer experiences, such as work experience opportunities, sports leagues, and recognition and reward, that homeschooled children miss out on. Additionally, mainstream schools are of higher educational quality, as teachers are required to have education degrees and may have more experience working with and teaching children. Finally, supporters argue that parents are not qualified as teachers and taking on the role of a teacher and administrator adds stress and fatigue to the parent's role. Overall, supporters of the ban on homeschooling believe that mainstream schools provide a vital social safety net for children, as well as a higher quality of education and opportunities."
"The debate topic is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. Opponents of mandatory vaccinations make two main claims. The first claim is that routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous. They point to the example of Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, which was pulled from the market nine months after it was introduced due to its potential link to bowel obstruction. Additionally, they argue that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine and that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome. The second claim is that mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights. Compulsory vaccination is seen as an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Opponents also argue that mandatory vaccination is a violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects the free exercise of religion."
"The debate topic is about whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory or not. Those who support mandatory vaccinations argue that routine child vaccinations are effective, save lives, necessary to protect others, prevent virus/disease spreading and children should not suffer from preventable diseases. The first argument is that routine child vaccinations are effective, as evidenced by the decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease and polio cases due to vaccination programs. The second argument is that vaccinations save lives, as evidenced by the decrease in childhood deaths from measles and the prevention of millions of illnesses, hospitalizations and early deaths of children. The third argument is that routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others, as evidenced by the outbreaks of pertussis and measles due to low herd immunity. The fourth argument is that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading, as evidenced by the effectiveness of pertussis vaccines and vaccination during pregnancy. The fifth argument is that children should not suffer from preventable diseases, as evidenced by the resurgence of preventable diseases due to vaccine hesitancy and the decrease in infections caused by Hib since the introduction of a vaccine."
"The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government, and the opponents argue against it by presenting five claims. The first claim is that social media regulation is not effective, and they support it with evidence that the lack of enforcement of data privacy laws in the European Union and in other legislation shows that Facebook and Google have not faced consequences for their data collection practices. The second claim is that social media regulation harms privacy, and they support it with evidence that people feel they have little control over how their personal information is used. The third claim is that social media regulation harms freedom of speech and other democratic rights, and they support it with evidence of countries passing laws that jeopardise human rights and press freedom. The fourth claim is that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, and they support it with evidence that government intervention can cause market disruptions and inefficiency. The fifth claim is that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government, and they support it with evidence of political advertisements targeting minority communities and fake pages set up by Russian entities during the 2016 US election."
"The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. The positive supporters argue that regulation is necessary for various reasons. Firstly, social media regulation protects younger audiences from harmful content. This is evidenced by cases such as Molly Russell's death, where her social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Secondly, social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news, which was widespread during the US presidential campaign. Thirdly, social media regulation is beneficial to society at large, as it creates sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, while also recognizing the great things about online, including free expression. Fourthly, social media regulation can help to deal with negative content, such as disinformation or hate speech. Finally, social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users, as evidenced by the unauthorized access of 60 million online social network accounts in 2011, and the Russian operation Internet Research Agency's interference in the US presidential election of 2016. Overall, these supporters argue that social media platforms need to be regulated by the government to ensure the safety and well-being of society at large."
"The opponents argue that the USA is not a good country to live in because it has several issues. The first issue is the unfair health and education policies. Many children under the age of 18 are without health insurance, and adults in households with low incomes find it difficult to afford healthcare costs. The second issue is the problematic and divisive political system. The polarization in the USA is particularly multifaceted, making it difficult to overcome. The third issue is the negative culture, where there is little respect for others, and people tend to climb the social ladder at the expense of others' dignity. The fourth issue is the high taxation and high costs of living, making it difficult for people to invest and secure their financial future. The fifth issue is the inequality and poverty, where the top 10% of Americans hold nearly 70% of the wealth. Lastly, the USA is considered unsafe due to the high number of mass shootings and the perception of safety among people. Additionally, the USA is considered xenophobic and racist, where racial discrimination continues to exist in the labor market, and middle-class blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites."
"The supporters of the proposition that the USA is a good country to live in present several arguments. Firstly, they claim that the USA has a strong economy and high standard of living, citing evidence that the USA has the largest national economy, controls the top spot in the ranking of Gross Domestic Product, and generates and earns more than 20% of the world's total income. Secondly, they argue that the USA has a good health and education system, with evidence that Americans enjoy the world's best cancer survival rates, a life expectancy for those over 80 that is greater than anywhere else, and lower mortality rates for heart attacks and strokes than in comparable countries. Thirdly, they assert that the USA has a great environment and nature, with evidence that there are over 20,000 flower species and more than 400 areas protected and maintained by the National Park Service. Fourthly, they contend that the USA has freedoms and democratic rights, citing a quote from Thomas Jefferson about a bill of rights and the adoption of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Fifthly, they argue that the USA has great people and culture, with evidence that American culture is diverse and influences the world. Sixthly, they assert that the USA is a powerful country, with evidence that the USA has been ranked the world's most powerful country several times and is the world's most dominant economic and military power. Finally, they claim that the USA offers great opportunities for individuals, with evidence that almost all of the biggest companies in the world have offices in the USA and job growth has been surging in recent months."
"The opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy for priests present multiple arguments to support their stance. First, they argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, and advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart. Second, celibacy is a strong religious belief and has been a privilege for the religious who have taken the vow of celibacy. Third, celibacy makes priests be perceived as holy, and the holy bishops, priests, and deacons of God should observe perfect continence. Fourth, priests choose to be celibate, and during the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Fifth, religious experiences and traditions should be maintained. Finally, removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, and celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church."
"The debate topic is whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned, and the positive supporters argue in favor of abandoning it. The first argument is that celibacy is outdated, supported by evidence that clerical celibacy should become optional and that change is inevitable. The second argument is that celibacy is too pressuring/difficult, supported by evidence that suppressing sexual urges has led to warped behavior, and celibacy is difficult to maintain without companionship. The third argument is that celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural, supported by evidence that it goes against nature's design for living organisms to reproduce and that it can cause depression and conflict. The fourth argument is that celibacy leads to wrong sexual behavior, as evidenced by the clergy sexual abuse scandals and statements by religious figures that celibacy may contribute to such behavior. The fifth argument is that celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests, supported by evidence that some individuals refuse ordination to avoid taking the vow and that ending celibacy could address the priest shortage."
"The opponents argue that we should not abandon marriage. They support their stance with five claims. Firstly, they argue that marriage benefits children as those raised in intact married families are physically and emotionally healthier, less likely to be abused, and have a decreased risk of divorce when they get married. Secondly, they claim that marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons, as it has a positive impact on children and society. Thirdly, they state that marriage makes people happy, as married people appear to be happier than those who are not married. Fourthly, they argue that marriage makes the couple closer as married adults are more satisfied and trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting. Lastly, they claim that marriage provides important financial benefits such as tax deductions for combined income and healthcare."
"The debate topic is whether we should abandon marriage. Those in favor of abandoning marriage argue that marriage preserves norms that are harmful to women, marriages are unstable, marriages tie up people with unfair obligations, and most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship. They provide evidence to support each of these claims, such as the growing body of evidence that shows the effects of marriage are worse for women than for men, the fact that divorce rates have increased globally since the 1970s, and the unfair treatment of wives perpetuated by laws governing marital relations. They also argue that monogamous relationships foster emotional intimacy and reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Overall, supporters of abandoning marriage believe that the institution perpetuates inequality and is no longer necessary for fulfilling intimate relationships."
"The debate topic is whether we should abandon the use of school uniforms. Opponents of abandoning school uniforms make the following arguments:
Firstly, children can still express themselves using other means. Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered the speech that the Constitution guarantees, and research shows that more than half of eighth-graders feel they can still express themselves even when following a school uniform policy.
Secondly, school uniforms reduce bullying. Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers believed that good school uniforms could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background. Moreover, poorer families may not afford the latest clothing trends, and their children may become the target of bullies.
Thirdly, school uniforms create a sense of equality and unity. Uniforms identify similar appearance and create a symbol of membership while excluding others outside the group. Additionally, students in uniforms reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community.
Fourthly, school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning. By taking the students' focus away from their attire and their peers' thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork and make the classroom a more serious environment, allowing them to perform better academically.
Lastly, school uniforms save costs. A national survey found that 94% of school leaders believed that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel. Moreover, a UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents less than the average non-school outfit."
"The debate topic is whether we should abandon the use of school uniform or not. The supporters of abandoning school uniforms put forward several claims to support their stance. The first claim is that school uniforms harm learning and creativity, as they restrict students' self-expression. The evidence supporting this claim includes senior Alyse Madsen's statement and Tara Maginnis Ph.D.'s writing. The second claim is that school uniforms harm students' self-expression. The evidence supporting this claim includes Robyn Silverman's statement and the violation of the First Amendment's right to freedom of expression. The third claim is that school uniforms are expensive. The evidence supporting this claim includes the Children's Society's research, which shows that the average cost of a school uniform is £340. The fourth claim is that school uniforms are often uncomfortable and sexist. The evidence supporting this claim includes the GLSEN study, which shows that 32 percent of transgender students have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex, and Laura Bates's statement. Finally, the fifth claim is that school uniforms increase conformity and harm individuality. The evidence supporting this claim includes research showing that allowing students to dress themselves encourages independent thinking and prepares them for adulthood. The debate supporters argue that school uniforms should be abandoned due to these reasons."
"The opponents of abolishing capital punishment present several arguments in support of retaining it. First, they argue that the death penalty provides closure for victims' families and expresses society's moral outrage for the most atrocious crimes. They cite specific cases of heinous crimes, such as that of Daniel Lewis Lee, to support this claim. Second, they argue that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, although the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Human Rights Watch oppose the use of the death penalty for juveniles and condemn extrajudicial killings. Third, they claim that the death penalty prevents crimes by deterring potential murderers. They refer to a study by Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd that shows a strong deterrent effect of capital punishment, with each execution resulting in 18 fewer murders on average. Charles Stimson also supports this claim, arguing that the death penalty serves the penological objectives of general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. Overall, opponents of abolishing capital punishment argue that the death penalty is necessary for justice and deterrence."
"The debate topic is about abolishing capital punishment and the supporters of this view have presented three main claims to support their argument. The first claim is that state-sanctioned killing is wrong, as evidenced by the unfair and unjust application of the death penalty in the US, where people of color and those without financial means are disproportionately affected. Innocent people are also too often sentenced to death. The second claim is that the death penalty harms the disenfranchised, as it diverts resources from other cases and programs that could better increase public safety, health, and welfare. The third claim is that the death penalty is irreversible, and deterrence plays no part in its application. Studies show that fear of the death penalty may cause some to hesitate, but not enough to keep it in force. Furthermore, the death penalty is not a deterrent, as evidenced by the consistent lower murder rates in states without the death penalty compared to those with it."
"The opponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that these rights incentivize creativity and innovation, as well as investment in developing new products. The evidence supporting these claims includes theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivizing the creation of new creative works and the positive correlation between strengthening the IP system and subsequent economic growth. Additionally, intellectual property rights protect against stealing, and owners of intellectual property should be compensated for their endeavors. Evidence also shows that IP-intensive industries generate more value added per employee than non-IP-intensive industries. Overall, opponents believe that intellectual property rights provide a financial incentive for the creation and investment in intellectual property."
"The proponents of abolishing intellectual property rights make the following arguments: 

Firstly, intellectual property rights prevent the continuous improvement of a service/product by creating monopolies that harm health, prevent progress, and benefit concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses. Secondly, intellectual property restricts access to important information and products, making it difficult for users to upload content to sites without fear of criminal liability. Thirdly, intellectual property rights are unfair because they prohibit people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material, infringing upon freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Fourthly, intellectual property rights harm creativity and innovation as they discourage it. Fifthly, intellectual property rights waste money, particularly for the first time, when getting protection for complex products, methods, designs, and processes. Lastly, intellectual property rights are ineffective, as they cannot rightfully be held as property and criminal law is poorly suited for regulating them."
"The opponents argue that the right to keep and bear arms should not be abolished. Firstly, they claim that gun control is ineffective, as several studies have shown that most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates and that restrictions on carrying concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders. Secondly, they argue that gun ownership is a right, as many gun owners believe that it is essential to their own sense of freedom and the U.S. Constitution guarantees this right. Thirdly, they argue that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports-shooting, as millions of people use firearms for these purposes, and hunters spend billions of dollars on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment. Lastly, they argue that gun ownership promotes self-protection, as gun owners cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm, and owning a gun makes them feel safer according to a Pew Foundation report."
"The supporters of the motion argue that the right to keep and bear arms should be abolished. Their arguments are based on the following claims:

Firstly, they claim that banning guns would save lives. They provide evidence that shows that gun-related killings increased by 25 percent when Missouri repealed its permit law and that killings also go up where gun dealers open for business.

Secondly, they argue that gun ownership allows for mass-shootings and general gun violence. They provide evidence that shows a correlation between permissiveness of gun laws and mass shootings and that guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide.

Thirdly, they claim that guns can fall into the wrong hands, leading to violence and death. They provide evidence of the Sutherland Springs massacre, where a man with a domestic violence conviction was able to buy guns and kill 26 people. They also add that many guns used by criminals were originally purchased legally.

Lastly, they argue that guns lead to accidental deaths. They provide evidence that people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns and that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm."
"The proponents of adopting an austerity regime face strong opposition from those who argue that it is not a viable solution. They present several claims with supporting evidence to substantiate their arguments. Firstly, austerity measures lead to cuts in essential services, with unprotected areas facing an average annual cut of 0.4%. Secondly, austerity policies extend recessions, as seen in several European countries, and can ultimately create a bigger fiscal hole. Thirdly, austerity is unfair to citizens, as it increases inequality and poverty levels. Fourthly, austerity results in lower growth and a fall in living standards for many countries. Finally, austerity leads to lower job creation, with more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. The impact is felt more by women who face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment, and austerity measures further reinforce these barriers. Overall, the evidence presented shows that the adoption of an austerity regime is not a viable solution."
"The debate topic is whether or not we should adopt an austerity regime. Supporters of austerity argue that it has several benefits. Firstly, austerity can improve economic measures as shown by research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina, who demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity’. Secondly, austerity is important in the long term, as some economists argue that cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy. Thirdly, austerity can increase stability by compressing domestic demand and expanding exports, which was demonstrated by the German model of adjustment in Ireland. Fourthly, austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts as seen in the UK's plan to achieve a budget surplus and declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade. Lastly, austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times, as seen in the successful model of austerity in the US between 1920 and 1921 and several European countries that turned to austerity during the global economic downturn in 2008."
"The debate topic is whether we should adopt atheism, and opponents argue against it with two main claims. Firstly, they argue that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion, citing evidence such as Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 and the criticism of atheism in the Russian dictatorship. Secondly, opponents argue that people should choose for themselves whether atheism should be adopted, and provide evidence such as the freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs and the idea that choosing God or no God is a matter of personal choice with no scientific proof either way."
"The debate topic is whether we should adopt atheism. The positive supporters of this stance argue that there are several reasons to support atheism. Firstly, atheists are free from religious confusions and do not have to fight their own religious concepts. This provides them with the advantage of not having to worry about their privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever they are doing and thinking. Secondly, atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists. Atheist Michael Scriven insists that atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence. Furthermore, J.L. Schellenberg has developed an argument based on several considerations that suggest that there is no loving God. Thirdly, religions are immoral and people should not follow them. Some religions teach people to do horrible things and set unrealistic expectations. Lastly, science can adequately explain the Universe. Stephen Weinberg, a Nobel Prize winner, is one who is hostile to faith and believes that anything scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done. Overall, the positive supporters of adopting atheism believe that it provides individuals with freedom from religious confusions, eliminates the need to follow immoral religions, and is supported by science."
"The opponents of adopting libertarianism argue that it has several negative consequences. Firstly, they claim that libertarianism harms economic growth by ignoring market failures and justifying government intervention in the economy. Secondly, they argue that libertarianism harms minorities and those who are worse off by prioritizing the negative liberties of the rich over the basic needs of the poor. Thirdly, they argue that libertarianism is unjust and non-equal by failing to address market failures and resulting in unequal outcomes. Fourthly, they argue that libertarianism removes essential laws, infrastructure, and government services, particularly with regards to environmental protection. Lastly, they argue that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens, particularly with regards to the protection of human rights and the environment."
"The topic of the debate is whether we should adopt libertarianism. The supporters of libertarianism argue that it has numerous benefits, such as increasing economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfilment, and individual freedom/liberties. The first argument is that libertarianism increases economic growth, as reduced taxation leads to financial freedom and prosperity. James Shikwati, a libertarian economist, promotes freedom of trade as the solution to poverty in Africa. The second argument is that libertarianism increases freedom in the political system by protecting property rights, which are fundamental to individual freedom and a just society. Libertarians believe that emphasizing individual freedom and property rights allows individuals to pursue their goals and interests. The third argument is that libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment by promoting social networks and community involvement, which are important factors in well-being and happiness. Libertarianism also allows individuals to pursue their own interests and goals, leading to happiness. The fourth argument is that libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties. Libertarians support maximum liberty in personal and economic matters. Self-ownership is the only alternative to owning another group of people or having no ownership over oneself. Libertarianism supports the self-ownership principle as it is axiomatic and universal. Therefore, adopting libertarianism can have numerous benefits in various aspects of society."
"The opponents of banning human cloning argue that cloning has various benefits that can improve medical research, reduce animal testing, and even help couples struggling with infertility. Cloning can also be used to create a child who is free of genetic diseases that are present in one of the parents or genetically related to one of the parents. Furthermore, cloning can help scientists study the genetic basis of infertility, aging, and evolution, which can lead to the development of new therapies and understandings. Lastly, cloning can be used to produce genetically modified organisms for various applications. Therefore, the opponents of banning human cloning argue that it should not be banned due to the potential benefits it offers."
"The debate topic is whether or not human cloning should be banned. The positive supporters argue that cloning should be banned for four main reasons. Firstly, cloning is not yet understood enough, and societies that tolerate cloning risk becoming desensitized to the ethical implications of such a practice. Additionally, the creation of clones, human-animal hybrids, or bioroids could result in the manufacturing and enslavement of unnatural beings. Secondly, cloning is deemed unethical and anti-religious by many. The Vatican and other religious organizations have spoken out against cloning, and some argue that it disrupts the natural familial order. Thirdly, cloning is considered unnatural, as it separates procreation from the traditional family unit. Finally, cloning is unsafe and can lead to many health problems and genetic abnormalities in the cloned individual. Reports have recommended measures to ensure cloning is used for medical purposes only, and studies have shown a low success rate for cloning animals. Based on these arguments, it is believed that human cloning should be banned."
"The opponents of banning private military companies argue that there are several benefits to hiring them. Firstly, private military companies offer financial benefits by reducing bureaucratic processes, allowing for a streamlined decision-making process and greater flexibility in terms of hiring and deploying personnel. Secondly, private military companies are well-trained and better equipped than regular armies, with the ability to quickly respond to changing circumstances and provide specialized training programs to their personnel. Thirdly, private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks, allowing regular army personnel to focus on their primary mission or carry out sensitive missions such as covert operations. Lastly, private military companies increase safety by providing support services and investing in advanced technology."
"The debate topic is whether or not we should ban private military companies. Those in favor of the ban argue that private military companies are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes. Evidence supporting this claim includes reports of unlawful killings committed by private military companies, including the killing of civilians. Studies have found that private military companies face a conflict of interest when serving both their client and the broader interests of society, leading to ethical violations. Additionally, private military companies have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, leading to increased risk and decreased professionalism in their operations. Private military companies cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country due to the lack of transparency surrounding their actions. Furthermore, the private military industry is largely unregulated, allowing companies to prioritize profit over other considerations, potentially soliciting and prolonging conflict. In conclusion, the arguments put forth suggest that private military companies should be banned due to their unethical practices, lack of professionalism, potential conflict of interest, profit-seeking behavior, and their potential to prolong conflicts."
"The debate topic is whether the use of child actors should be banned or not. Opponents of the ban argue that child actors should not be banned because acting may be the child's dream, and some children and young people have a natural talent for acting. The American Psychological Association and the Drama Teachers Association of America support this claim. Additionally, casting children in certain roles can increase audience engagement and make the production more appealing to a wider audience, according to the Actors Equity Association, and casting children in certain roles can be crucial for character development and help to convey important themes in the story, according to a study published in the Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism. The opponents further argue that child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision/regulation, and that parents should decide for their child. The evidence supporting this claim includes the need to obey child labor laws and the requirement for a child actor to secure an entertainment work permit before accepting any paid performing work. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations support the claim that parents have legal protection for their right to make decisions for their children, and that their cultural and religious values should be respected and protected."
"The debate topic is whether or not we should ban the use of child actors. The supporters of this motion argue that child performers are harmed by their work, at risk of exploitation, losing their childhood, have a lot of pressure, and tend to develop problems later in life. They cite evidence such as a study published in the Journal of Adolescence in 2018, which found that child performers may experience long-term negative effects on their personal, professional, and academic lives. They also cite a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2016, which found that child performers may experience burnout due to high levels of pressure and stress. Another study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014 found that child performers may be at risk of human trafficking due to their vulnerability and the lack of oversight in the industry. The supporters of the ban conclude that children should not be subjected to these negative consequences and that their well-being should be prioritized over entertainment."
"The opponents of closing Guantanamo Bay detention camp present three claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that closing the detention camp would harm national security, citing evidence that around 17.5% of former detainees have reengaged in terrorist or insurgent activities after being transferred to other countries. They also highlight the definition of "
"The debate topic is whether or not Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed. The positive supporters argue that the camp should be closed for several reasons. Firstly, detainees have the right to a trial in US courts, which has been established by the US supreme court. Secondly, the camp harms the US image and reputation and serves as a recruiting tool for terrorists. Thirdly, the camp is a symbol of discrimination and injustice. Fourthly, it is expensive to operate, with estimates of around $2.7 million per prisoner in 2013. Fifthly, personnel at the camp have committed crimes against prisoners, including physical abuse and torture. Lastly, unjust treatment and tactics are used in the camp, including sleep deprivation, stress positions, and sexual assault. Overall, the positive supporters believe that closing the camp is necessary to uphold human rights and justice, improve the US image, and save costs."
"The opponents of ending affirmative action make three main claims. Firstly, affirmative action boosts diversity as Asian students benefit from exposure to a diverse student body. Secondly, affirmative action is necessary to compensate for past discrimination and persecution faced by black people, while other groups such as Jews and Asians have had a different historical experience. Lastly, affirmative action reduces discrimination by correcting past policies and addressing existing discrimination, as demonstrated by the case of Johnson v. Transportation Agency."
"The topic of the debate is whether affirmative action should be ended. The positive supporters argue that affirmative action should be ended because it diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. The first argument is that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, as Asian-American students are marked down on "
"As opponents of ending mandatory retirement, we argue that having a mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers. According to a study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019, mandatory retirement ages can stimulate economic growth. This is because younger workers are given more opportunities to enter the workforce and contribute to economic activity. Additionally, a report by the International Labour Organization in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people, as older workers are encouraged to leave the workforce and make room for younger workers. Therefore, we believe that ending mandatory retirement may lead to decreased opportunities for younger workers and could harm overall economic growth."
"The debate topic is about whether we should end mandatory retirement. Supporters of ending mandatory retirement argue that it decreases institutional knowledge and harms the economy. Studies by the International Monetary Fund and the International Labour Organization found that mandatory retirement ages can limit labor market flexibility and lead to inefficient use of human capital. Additionally, mandatory retirement is not fair and can decrease the quality of life for those forced to retire. Instead, they argue that everyone should be able to retire when they are ready, as it can reduce the risk of poverty in old age and support active aging. Furthermore, studies have shown that allowing older workers to continue working can benefit society by using their skills and experience. A case study was cited in support of the argument, where a businessman implemented innovative employment policies by barring mandatory retirement age, actively recruiting differently-abled workers, and providing profit sharing."
"As the proponents of the abolition of nuclear weapons, we reject the idea that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. While opponents may argue that deterrence has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years, we would like to remind them of the numerous close calls and incidents that have brought us to the brink of nuclear war. One such example is the Cuban Missile Crisis, where the world was on the verge of a nuclear war due to the possession of nuclear weapons by both the US and the Soviet Union. This highlights the inherent danger and instability of a world where nuclear weapons exist.

Furthermore, opponents may argue that the invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as the country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. However, we would like to remind them of the devastating effects that even a single nuclear weapon could have on a nation, as seen in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The possession of nuclear weapons only increases the chances of such destruction, as well as the risk of accidental use, intentional use, or theft by non-state actors.

In conclusion, we strongly believe that the abolition of nuclear weapons is crucial for the survival of humanity. We cannot afford to continue living in a world where the threat of nuclear war hangs over our heads. We must work towards a world where nuclear weapons are eliminated, and diplomacy and cooperation are prioritized to ensure lasting peace."
"The supporters argue that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. They have put forth two claims to support their stance. Firstly, they assert that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands, and this is a cause of concern. The evidence provided in support of this claim includes the theft or loss of nuclear materials that are not going away, and more states are interested in developing them. The second claim put forth is that nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action. The evidence provided in support of this claim suggests that when tensions escalate, unfortunate coincidences can conspire to create significant problems, and we were very lucky to get through the Cuban Missile Crisis. Additionally, the fact that we lost contact with 50 missiles highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago."
"The opponents argue that we should not fight urbanization because cities offer more opportunities, benefits the economy, and benefits the environment. They provide evidence to support each claim. For instance, they argue that during Japan's economic development, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Moreover, urbanization leads to economic growth due to scale, technological developments, and diversity of both products and occupations. The opponents also argue that urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies and brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Thus, they conclude that urbanization should not be fought."

"The opponents of introducing compulsory voting present three main arguments against the idea. Firstly, abstaining from voting is also a way of reflecting one's preferences. Herbert Spencer argued that abstaining from voting means that one does not consent to the rule of the winning candidate. Abstaining can also be used to indicate ambivalence or mild disapproval of a measure. Secondly, citizens have a right not to vote, and compulsory voting is a breach of civil liberties. Compulsion can lead to a slippery slope towards totalitarianism. Thirdly, compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, which can have a detrimental effect on the civic engagement and skew election results. It can also encourage politicians to use sensational and misleading advertising to appeal to less informed voters."
"The debate topic is whether we should introduce compulsory voting. The positive supporters of this stance provide three main arguments to support their position. Firstly, they argue that compulsory voting increases representation. Countries like the United States have experienced lower turnout from poorer and less educated people, leading to a skewed political system. Compulsory voting would ensure that candidates address the needs of all voters. Secondly, they suggest that compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. This is because it increases the legitimacy of elected representatives and the political education of the people. Lastly, they claim that people have an obligation to vote. Voter turnout in countries where voting is compulsory, like Thailand, is not much of a problem. People who can vote but don't are taking their right to vote for granted, as it is one of the most important rights we have. Therefore, the positive supporters of compulsory voting argue that it is necessary to increase representation, political engagement, and fulfill our civic duty to vote."
"The opponents of legalizing cannabis put forward four claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that cannabis harms the body, as studies have shown that smoking cannabis can cause damage to the airways and impaired psychomotor skills. Secondly, opponents claim that cannabis increases lack of judgement and accidents, with research showing a rise in fatal car crashes involving cannabis consumption. Thirdly, opponents claim that cannabis is a gateway drug that can lead to addiction, with studies suggesting that early cannabis smokers are more likely to move on to harder drugs. Lastly, opponents argue that legalizing cannabis can lead to it getting into the hands of underage teenagers and children, citing Alaska's experience where legalization led to higher usage rates among teens."
"The debate topic is whether cannabis should be legalized, and the supporters of its legalization present several arguments. First, they argue that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs, yet they remain legal. They provide evidence that many illicit drugs pose fewer health risks than certain legal drugs, and the risks from cannabis use are overstated. Legalizing marijuana for adults on the same terms as alcohol would reduce crime and possibly reduce alcohol consumption. Second, they argue that legalizing cannabis is financially beneficial. They provide evidence that legalizing cannabis could save money in law enforcement costs and generate tax revenue. Third, they argue that cannabis is safe and can have medical benefits. They point out that the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis is inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine. Fourth, they argue that if cannabis were legalized, it could be regulated, which would allow for selective social control and reduce its popularity among young people. Fifth, they argue that legalizing cannabis would reduce black-market and criminal activity. They cite a study that found drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and argue that treating drug use as a health issue rather than criminalizing people could reduce crime and improve health."
"The opponents argue against the legalization of prostitution by presenting three claims and providing evidence to support their arguments. Firstly, they argue that legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, citing studies that state that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population. Secondly, they argue that legalizing sex work will increase immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking, as evidenced by substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes. Additionally, they provide a report that concludes that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing. Finally, opponents argue that legalizing sex work will increase violence against women, citing research conducted by Giobbe that found similarities in the behavior of pimps and batterers, and a survey of female sex workers in Leeds, England, and Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland, revealed that a significant percentage had experienced violence."
"The debate topic is whether prostitution should be legalized, and its positive supporters have presented five arguments to support their stance. The first argument is that legalizing sex work boosts the economy, citing historical examples and the benefits of taxable income. The second argument is that legalizing sex work increases benefits for sex workers, including health care and safe sex measures. The third argument is that legalizing sex work allows for regulation of the profession, leading to safer and revenue-generating brothels. The fourth argument is that legalizing sex work makes the profession safer for women, with examples of successful prevention interventions and decriminalization in New Zealand. Finally, the fifth argument is that sex work is a valid choice over one's body, with sex workers viewing it as a profession and a way of making money. These arguments are supported by a range of evidence, including historical examples, public health research, and surveys of sex workers."
"The opponents of legalizing sex selection present three main claims. Firstly, sex selection can lead to gender imbalance as evidenced by the 140 million missing women globally and the rise in sex selection in certain areas, leading to a damaging effect on societies. Secondly, sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases as it allows parents to choose the gender of their child and act like "
"The debate topic is about legalizing sex selection and the positive supporters have presented several arguments. Firstly, they argue that it is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child. The advantage of selecting the gender of the baby in advance is that parents are able to plan for their family, ensuring that they have an adequate number of children to raise and can provide them with good education and proper nutrition. Additionally, it can also prevent gender-specific diseases from being passed onto the baby. Secondly, sex selection allows for better family planning as it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. Moreover, this technology gives parents the opportunity to have a child of the gender they desire and helps them complete their family. Thirdly, sex selection makes the family more happy/complete, and is especially helpful for parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth. Fourthly, sex selection prevents diseases in the child. Lastly, it is argued that sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide as it gives intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer. Overall, the positive supporters of legalizing sex selection argue that it is a desirable scenario and offers many benefits."
"The opponents of prohibiting flag burning argue that it is an effective tool of expression, protest, and critique. They provide evidence that burning the flag is considered symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment. For example, in the case of Gregory Lee Johnson, the court ruled in favor of him because burning the flag was a form of expression and his protest was sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment. Additionally, opponents argue that flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression, and the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable. Justice William Brennan supports this argument in his majority opinion, stating that burning the flag is considered an expressive activity protected by the First Amendment. While flag desecration may be offensive to many, it is an essential form of free speech that should not be prohibited."
"The topic for the debate is 'We should prohibit flag burning'. Those who support the prohibition of flag burning have put forth two main claims to support their stance. The first claim is that flags are important symbols that should be respected. They argue that just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Evidence supporting this claim includes the fact that in Austria, flag desecration is illegal under Â§248 Strafgesetzbuch. The second claim is that flag burning is an inflammatory act. Supporters of this claim state that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed. They point out that according to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration."
"The topic of the debate is whether or not women should be prohibited from serving in combat. The opponents argue against this stance with several claims. First, they argue for gender equality, as women have shown to have important contributions to society and benefit from equal rights. Second, they argue that women are an asset in combat, as physical strength is becoming less important and women have proven to have unique skills and strategies. Third, they claim that women can overcome physical differences and be just as capable in combat as men. Fourth, they argue that women should have the choice to serve in combat if they pass the necessary tests. Finally, they provide evidence to support the idea that women can perform equally to men in combat roles, and that there are new fitness standards that ensure gender neutrality in the selection process."
"The debate topic is whether women should be prohibited in combat, and the positive supporters of this stance put forth five claims to support their argument. 

Firstly, they claim that men are better suited for combat than women due to physical differences that can hinder women in combat. They provide evidence from a Marine Corps study that found all-male units to be faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. They also argue that the military is lowering fitness standards to accommodate female soldiers, which is detrimental to the institution as a whole.

Secondly, they argue that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers in combat. They cite evidence that the US Army is considering reversing gender-neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. They also mention that nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short in the Army Combat Fitness Test, which raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women.

Thirdly, they claim that women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. They provide evidence that mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have grave consequences, and that fraternization between male and female soldiers can undermine unit cohesion, morale, teamwork, and operational effectiveness.

Fourthly, they argue that women should serve in safer roles. They mention that in the Israeli Defense Forces, fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions, and that women are concentrated in combat support. They also argue that women have a naturally nurturing disposition and that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless.

Finally, they claim that women soldiers' capture is a big concern. They argue that women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men, making them less consistent and dependable in tough situations. They provide evidence that every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped, including a female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg.

Overall, the positive supporters of prohibiting women in combat present a range of arguments and evidence to support their stance, citing physical differences, fitness standards, distraction, safety, and capture concerns as reasons why women should not serve in combat roles."
"The opponents of the proposition that we should subsidize journalism argue that government intervention in this matter carries a significant risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. This is supported by the argument that if the government funds journalism, they will inevitably seek to regulate it, which could undermine the freedom of the press. In addition, political endorsements could create the appearance of favoritism in reporting, which can create a perceived conflict of interest and further erode the public's trust in journalism. Overall, opponents believe that government subsidy of journalism would be a harmful interference that could ultimately damage the credibility and integrity of the press."
"The debate topic is whether we should subsidize journalism, and the positive supporters argue that it is important to do so. The first claim is that a subsidy is important to make journalism viable, which is supported by evidence such as the loss of advertising revenues during the pandemic, leading to the need for state subsidies. Additionally, WikiLeaks is seen as filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism, and support for WikiLeaks is motivated by declining funding and resources for investigative reporting. 

The second claim is that journalism is important to information-spreading and accountability, supported by evidence such as mainstream media being the lifeblood of topical social media conversations in the UK, and education in journalism helping to empower members of the public to understand how media works. 

The third claim is that subsidies will increase the quality of journalism, which is supported by evidence such as the European Union providing subsidies to encourage new entrants and small players to compete against powerful incumbents, leading to a media-plural Europe that facilitates democratic decision-making. Furthermore, the IPD journalism program helps strengthen journalists' economic literacy and equips them to report and write about the major economic issues confronting developing economies."
"The opponents argue that space exploration should not be subsidized because it can be carried out by the private sector, it is expensive, ineffective, and there are more important issues to fund. They provide evidence that private companies such as Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX have partnered with government agencies like NASA to expand space exploration rapidly. Moreover, space exploration is costly, difficult, harsh, perilous, and risky, costing billions of dollars annually. The opponents argue that space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution, and missions to other planets and interstellar space do not contribute to life on Earth. Finally, there are a number of ways to spend the annual budget of $19.3 billion, such as funding education, healthcare, or addressing global warming, crime rates, or finding a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the opponents argue that space exploration should not be subsidized, and the money and effort could be better used to solve more important problems."
"The debate topic is whether we should subsidize space exploration. Those in favor argue that space exploration can help colonize resources on other planets, improve science and technology, and is financially beneficial. They also argue that it is necessary for the survival of humanity and unravels information about the universe. Evidence to support these claims includes the potential to drive down the cost of data through satellite broadband, the need for technology capable of recycling resources for current and future space exploration missions, and the contributions of space investigations to understanding the universe."
"The opponents of subsidizing vocational education have several arguments against this proposal. Firstly, they argue that this will divert money from more worthy causes. Evidence suggests that many vocational education programs may not provide the necessary skills and knowledge for workers to succeed in the 21st century. Secondly, opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education is expensive and may reduce funding for other important programs. Studies show that scaling vocational education programs can be limited, and subsidies can lead to a reduction in financial aid, student support services, and research and development. Thirdly, opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions. Evidence suggests that subsidies can influence student choice and lead to an increase in enrollment and employment in relevant fields. Finally, opponents argue that vocational education is not a good career choice, as it often does not provide opportunities for advancement or adequate support for non-college bound students."
"The debate topic is whether or not we should subsidize vocational education. Those who support subsidizing vocational education argue that it promotes economic mobility, especially for individuals who do not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education or who face employment barriers. Studies indicate that subsidizing vocational education aligns with local labor market needs, which can benefit regions with high demand for skilled workers. Vocational education programs offer customized learning experiences tailored to individual needs and interests, which can better fit the learning styles of many students compared to traditional academic programs. Vocational education programs often have a career-focused curriculum, which can better fit the career goals and aspirations of many students compared to traditional academic programs. Studies show that individuals with vocational education often have shorter time to employment and higher earning potential than those without postsecondary education. Subsidizing vocational education can promote workforce diversity by providing training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by increasing the representation of diverse individuals in the workforce. Additionally, investments in vocational education can support local economies by providing training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by filling workforce shortages and contributing to overall economic development. Therefore, subsidizing vocational education is beneficial for both individuals and society as a whole."
