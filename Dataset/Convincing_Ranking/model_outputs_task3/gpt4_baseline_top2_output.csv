"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around Â£10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
    - Evidence 2: Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 2: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying argue that if a person does not wish to take advantage of a change in the law which would allow for an assisted death then that is down to personal choice..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 2: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
","Topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'

Opponents' Arguments Summary:
Opponents of the criminalization of assisted suicide argue that it provides dignity to the individuals who desire it. They emphasize the principle of personal autonomy, highlighting that the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee in 2005 argued for terminally ill people's right to medical assistance for death, similar to the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment.

The opponents further contend that assisted suicide can reduce suffering, as backed by studies reporting that the availability of assisted death can provide peace of mind to terminally ill individuals, reducing the distress associated with their pain and suffering.

The opponents also argue that individuals should have the freedom to choose to end their lives, a stance held by the plaintiffs in Canada who advocated for medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults.

Lastly, they insist that the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide as it provides a preferable alternative to enduring pain or suffering. This point is underpinned by arguments favoring euthanasia, as well as experiences from places where euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide is legal.","Topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'

Supporters' Arguments Summary:
Those who argue for assisted suicide to be criminalized assert that it infringes upon the doctor's role as a healer, citing Dr. Lynda Young's statement that physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with this role. 

They posit that individuals do not have the right to self-harm or harm others, drawing upon the New Zealand Medical Association's stance opposing voluntary euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide due to its unethical nature. 

The supporters also argue that ill individuals may not have clear judgement and require help, referring to Emanuel's caution about potential involuntary euthanasia of vulnerable groups, if physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia are permitted.

Topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned'

Opponents' Arguments Summary:
Opponents of the ban on homeschooling assert that it is often the best educational option for exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students. They cite changes in American voters' attitudes towards homeschooling and the suitability of homeschooling for families living in isolated locations or abroad, or for young athletes and actors. 

They further argue that homeschooling can be personalized according to a child's pace and needs, and refer to Nelson's point that personalizing education leads to higher engagement. They emphasize that this personalized approach can better meet the needs of students with special educational needs compared to mainstream schools.

Opponents also point to the issue of violence and bullying in mainstream schools as reasons to oppose a ban on homeschooling. 

They insist that parents should have the right to choose their children's education, seeing homeschooling as a means to take direct responsibility for their children's learning. 

Lastly, opponents believe that a home is a good learning environment. They reference the broader socialization homeschooling can provide and the opportunities it gives for children to structure their own days. They also suggest that the home environment allows for a deeper understanding of a child's educational progress."
"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dr. Lynda Young, MD, stated her opposition when she said, 'Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'.
    - Evidence 2: The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient..
- claim_2: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
    - Evidence 2: Any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted of assisting suicide or attempting to do so..
- claim_3: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
    - Evidence 2: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..

"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject thatâs piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if theyâre ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren âa more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
    - Evidence 2: Unschoolers cite studies which report that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers, and some believe this is a result of the wide range of people with which they have the opportunity to communicate..

"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 2: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying itâs âimportant that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other peopleâs viewpoints..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your childâs educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if youâre hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that theyâre teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 2: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authorityâs requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child â perhaps the whole day, every day â and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..
","Debate Topic: Homeschooling should be banned

Supporting Stance:

Argument: Homeschools cannot be adequately regulated or standardized.
Evidence: Homeschooling, without the appropriate regulation and oversight, opens up potential for abuse and deprives children of important safety nets provided by the traditional schooling system, such as detection of child abuse, ensuring adequate nutrition, and vaccination requirements.

Argument: Mainstream schools are essential for the development of social skills.
Evidence: Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard Law School professor, emphasizes that traditional schooling environments foster community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination, and tolerance of others' viewpoints, which are vital for a child's holistic growth.

Argument: Mainstream schools offer higher educational quality.
Evidence: Teachers in public schools are required to carry education degrees, potentially making them more equipped and experienced in teaching children. Even the National Education Association, a teachers' union, is opposed to homeschooling.

Argument: Parents may not be as qualified as professional teachers.
Evidence: Homeschooling often puts enormous responsibility and workload on parents. They not only need to ensure quality education but also have to administer other roles such as coordinating activities, meeting local authority requirements, and preparing children for exams, which can lead to stress and fatigue.","**Debate Topic: Homeschooling should be banned**

**Debate Topic: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory**

*Opposing Stance:*

1. *Argument:* Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, can be dangerous.
   *Evidence:* Certain vaccines have been linked to significant health complications, such as the Rotashield vaccine for rotavirus, which was associated with bowel obstruction, and the chickenpox vaccine that can potentially cause pneumonia.

2. *Argument:* Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
   *Evidence:* Compulsory vaccination can be perceived as an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.

*Supporting Stance:*

1. *Argument:* Routine child vaccinations are effective.
   *Evidence:* The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has led to a significant decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease. The cases of polio have also drastically reduced from 350,000 cases in 1988 to 500 in 2014 worldwide, thanks to vaccination programs.

2. *Argument:* Child vaccinations save lives.
   *Evidence:* Measles vaccines have led to a 74% decrease in childhood deaths from measles. The CDC also estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018.

3. *Argument:* Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
   *Evidence:* Failure to meet the herd immunity threshold has led to major disease outbreaks. An instance was the whooping cough outbreak in 2012 in 49 US states.

4. *Argument:* Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
   *Evidence:* Pertussis vaccines, recommended for routine use by WHO and CDC, saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002. Vaccination during pregnancy also significantly protects infants from diseases like pertussis.

5. *Argument:* Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
   *Evidence:* Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases. For example, in 2019, measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide. Infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988."

","Opposing View: Social media platforms should not be regulated by the government

Opponents argue that government regulation of social media is not only ineffective, but also harms privacy and freedom of speech, interferes with private business operations, and could be abused for political purposes.

Ineffectiveness of Regulation: Despite the introduction of significant legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, evidence shows that there has been little action against major companies like Facebook and Google over their data collection practices.

Privacy Concerns: A Pew Research Center survey reveals that most people feel they have little control over their personal information and that the potential risks of data collection by companies and government outweigh the benefits.

Threat to Freedom of Speech: Instances of social media regulation have often resulted in the suppression of free speech. For example, following the enactment of a cybersecurity law in Vietnam, Facebook began to restrict content significantly, impacting activists and journalists. A United Nations human rights expert warns that almost every country adopting laws related to online content has jeopardized human rights.

Interference in Private Business: Critics argue that government intervention can disrupt market equilibrium, potentially extending economic recessions or depressions. Government spending on public goods may also lead to excess bureaucracy and inefficiency.

Risk of Political Abuse: Past incidents, such as the targeted political advertisements during the 2016 elections in the US and UK aimed at suppressing voting and political participation, highlight the potential for governments to abuse social media regulations for political purposes.","**Opposing View: Social media platforms should not be regulated by the government**

4. Interference in Private Business: Critics argue that government intervention can disrupt market equilibrium, potentially extending economic recessions or depressions. Government spending on public goods may also lead to excess bureaucracy and inefficiency.

5. Risk of Political Abuse: Past incidents, such as the targeted political advertisements during the 2016 elections in the US and UK aimed at suppressing voting and political participation, highlight the potential for governments to abuse social media regulations for political purposes.

**Supporting View: Social media platforms should be regulated by the government**

Supporters argue that government regulation of social media is necessary to protect younger audiences, tackle fake news, benefit society at large, manage negative content, and deal with malicious users.

1. Protection of Young Audiences: Government intervention is necessary to protect young people online. The tragic case of Molly Russell, a British teenager who was exposed to distressing content on social media, underscores this need.

2. Tackling Fake News: The prevalence of disinformation, particularly during election periods, as seen with the Russian propaganda during the US 2016 election, necessitates government regulation to ensure the veracity of news content.

3. Societal Benefits: OfcomÕs Chief Executive, Dame Melanie Dawes, believes that the many benefits of being online must be balanced with the need to protect users from serious harm and protect free expression.

4. Managing Negative Content: The rise of harmful or misleading content online indicates a need for regulation. As Zimana's Pierre DeBois suggests, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms handle issues like disinformation or hate speech.

5. Dealing with Malicious Users: The high number of unauthorized access to social media accounts and the interference of foreign entities in national affairs, such as the Russian operation Internet Research AgencyÕs involvement in the 2016 US election, highlight the urgent need for government regulation to ensure user safety and national security."
"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: âThe government [â¦] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current âstandards lotteryâ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,â' said Lamb in a statement. â'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.â'.
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russellâs father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: âDid Twitter kill the First Amendment?â.
    - Evidence 2: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcomâs Chief Executive, said: âWeâre really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. Weâre gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and weâll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.â.
    - Evidence 2: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'This proportionate new framework will ensure we donât put unnecessary burdens on small businesses but give large digital businesses robust rules of the road to follow so we can seize the brilliance of modern technology to improve our lives.'.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platformâs responses can and will influence how customers view your organizationâs association with the platform.'.
    - Evidence 2: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: âOnline safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action canât come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.â.

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
    - Evidence 2: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..

    - Evidence 2: Adults in households with annual incomes under $40,000 are more than three times as likely as adults in households with incomes over $90,000 to say it is difficult to afford their health care costs (69% v. 21%)..
- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In their study of polarization across nations, Thomas Carothers and Andrew OâDonohue argue that polarization runs particularly deep in the U.S. in part because American polarization is 'especially multifaceted.'.
    - Evidence 2: According to Carothers and OâDonohue, a âpowerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion renders Americaâs divisions unusually encompassing and profound..
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045). Simply living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, researchers suggest..
    - Evidence 2: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritradeâs financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..
    - Evidence 2: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, othersâparticularly prescription drugs, childcare, and educationâhave risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The United Statesâ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019âthe same as Bulgariaâs and Turkeyâs, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germanyâaccording to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..
    - Evidence 2: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe â a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
    - Evidence 2: A country where, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 253 mass shootings in the country since the beginning of 2019. Thatâs more shootings than days. Two of those occurred over the weekend in less than 24 hours, first in El Paso, Texas followed by Dayton, Ohio, leaving 31 dead..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with âwhite-soundingâ names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with âblack-soundingâ names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..
    - Evidence 2: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummingsâ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..

"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
    - Evidence 2: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 2: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the churchâs Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said âobligatory celibacyâ for Catholic priests âmay â¦ have contributed to abuse in some circumstancesâ, and recommended priests undergo âpsycho-sexual developmentâ training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..

"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 2: Plenty of research indicates that healthy marriage positively impacts children and society. And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, itâs possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of lifeâs greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creatorâs unconditional love for us. Itâs a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
    - Evidence 2: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 2: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 2: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..
","Topic: 'We should abandon marriage'

Opposing arguments summary:

Those opposing the abandonment of marriage assert that marriage:

Benefits children: Evidence shows that children raised in intact marriages are more likely to attend college, are healthier, less likely to be abused or engage in delinquent behaviors, and less likely to divorce when they marry themselves.
Holds religious and traditional importance: Marriage can be viewed as a mirror of the Creator's unconditional love and brings joy and contentment to the couple. It is also beneficial for raising children, especially given the increase in mental and behavioral disorders and criminal activity in children raised without a father.
Increases happiness: Research indicates that people who are satisfied with their lives are more likely to get married, and those who are married tend to be happier than those who are not.
Strengthens couple's bond: Married adults have been found to be more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners compared to cohabiting couples.
Provides financial benefits: Marriage has financial advantages like higher standard deductions and tax-deductible health insurance premiums for both spouses.","**Topic: 'We should abandon marriage'**

**Supporting arguments summary:**

The proponents for abandoning marriage suggest that:

1. Marriage can harm women: Evidence indicates that the effects of marriage can be worse for women than men, with women often being expected to take on a traditional, subservient role.
2. Marriages are unstable: Data shows that divorce rates have risen globally since the 1970s, suggesting a level of instability inherent in marriages.
3. Marriages enforce unfair obligations: Laws and societal norms can force women into subservient roles, with religious texts and legal rules sometimes encouraging this inequality.
4. Advantages of marriage can be achieved outside it: Monogamous relationships can foster the same emotional intimacy and health benefits that marriage does, without the legal and societal obligations of marriage."
"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and itâs thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
    - Evidence 2: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: You might have heard the popularised claim that âhalf of marriages end in divorceâ. We can see here where that claim might come from â it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: âat the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.â.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked âwilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?â whilst the bride is asked âwilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.â Even enshrined within wedding vows is a womanâs essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
    - Evidence 2: Qatarâs laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed âdisobedientâ if she does not obtain her husbandâs permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a âlegitimateâ reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 2: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..

"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.

- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 2: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms âreported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress groupâ (David L. Brunsma)..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peersâ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
    - Evidence 2: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.

    - Evidence 1: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents Â£88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back Â£113.00..

"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victimsâ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan Peopleâs Revolutionâ¦ Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victimâs loved onesâin a case where Lee doesnât even deny his guilt..
    - Evidence 2: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the stateâs ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victimsâ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..

    - Evidence 2: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as deliberate and systematic .. extrajudicial killings, and has condemned them as crimes against humanity..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a âJudicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishmentâ¦ Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specificationsâ¦ The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the dataâs aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executionsâ¦ Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldnât do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty wonât be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of societyâs right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the peopleâs representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..

South Carolina's Governor, Henry McMaster, also supports this argument, asserting that the death penalty provides victims' families with justice and closure.

In contrast, supporters of abolishing capital punishment put forward three counter-arguments:

1. They contend that state-sanctioned killing is fundamentally wrong. They note that the death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner, disproportionately affecting people based on their socioeconomic status and race. They argue that innocent people are too often sentenced to death, pointing out that over 156 people have been released from death row due to proven innocence since 1973.

2. The supporters argue that the death penalty disproportionately harms the disenfranchised. They reference a 2010 study showing that the median cost of a federal death penalty case is nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case, suggesting that such resources could be better used elsewhere to increase public safety, health, and welfare.

3. Finally, they argue that the death penalty is irreversible, highlighting that the risk of executing an innocent person is too great. Craig Trocino, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, stated that there is no proven deterrence factor to the death penalty and that states without it consistently have lower murder rates."
"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
    - Evidence 2: In one occasion, Persian daily Neshat published an article which called for abolishing the death penalty, claiming that the capital punishment is no cure for maladies afflicting modern society..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I wonât commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
    - Evidence 2: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..

Topic: Should we abolish intellectual property rights?

Stance: Opposition to Abolition

Opponents of the abolition of intellectual property rights offer several arguments:

Intellectual property rights incentivize creativity/innovation. The incentive theories view intellectual property as essential for promoting new creative works, as it provides the author with the incentive to create. Without such rights, there's a fear that authors wouldn't produce new works due to lack of economic gain.

Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in new products. Evidence from a joint research project by WIPO and United Nations University showed a positive correlation between strengthening of intellectual property system and economic growth in six Asian countries. Moreover, the Business Software Alliance noted the public's support for rewarding innovators monetarily to encourage more technological advances.

Intellectual property rights protect against theft. Advocates argue that intellectual property, such as movies, music, and television shows, are better preserved with copyright. This aligns with Locke's argument that creators have the right to control what they create.

Owners should be compensated for their innovations. The exclusive rights provided by intellectual property laws allow creators to benefit financially from their creations, thus, creating a monetary incentive to invest in research and development.

**Stance: Support for Abolition**

Those who advocate for the abolition of intellectual property rights make the following points:

1. **Intellectual property hinders improvement of a product/service.** Critics argue that intellectual monopolies can harm health and prevent progress, benefiting concentrated interests at the cost of the public. They posit that public interest is harmed by ever-increasing monopolies like copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents.

2. **Intellectual property restricts access to vital information/products.** Intellectual property can potentially criminalize users who upload copyrighted content due to poor definition of punishable conduct. Moreover, it disregards the inherent rights of indigenous peoples related to their cultural, spiritual, and historical possessions.

3. **Intellectual property rights are unjust.** Roderick T. Long and Edwin Hettinger argue that intellectual property infringes freedom of speech and freedom of the press and that natural rights arguments for intellectual property are weak.

4. **Intellectual property rights stifle creativity/innovation.** Historical analysis, as Petra Moser suggests, indicates that strong intellectual property rights may discourage innovation as innovators may worry about infringing upon intellectual property rights in a free culture.

5. **Intellectual property rights are costly.** The process of acquiring protection can be expensive, especially for complex products involving various methods, designs, and processes. Moreover, monopolies, including intellectual ones, create many social costs.

6. **Intellectual property rights are ineffective.** Critics argue that patents and copyrights protect something that cannot rightfully be held as property, making them inappropriate for regulation of intellectual property law and present a risk to industry and innovation."

"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: âFor example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining âunprotectedâ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
    - Evidence 2: âTaking care of âat riskâ children is a mandatory concern. However, youth centres and outreach services are considered unessential and have been cut to the bone. Yet these are services that help prevent children becoming âat riskâ in the first place,â said Gray..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
    - Evidence 2: âIf he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,â said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
    - Evidence 2: I was 18 [and homeless] and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work. I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing â Tayah, west London..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries â including the UK â price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
    - Evidence 2: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
    - Evidence 2: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally âmaleâ occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..

Critics also note how austerity policies exacerbated recessions in several European countries, according to economists like Blanchard, Leigh, and Krugman. They contend that austerity measures increase income inequality and poverty, as indicated by IMF studies, and have resulted in slowed growth in OECD countries and decreased job creation in nations with robust employment protection legislation.","Topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime'

Supporters' Summary:
Supporters of austerity regimes, on the other hand, contend that such measures can enhance economic performance, bring long-term benefits, increase stability, reduce deficits, and are crucial during economic turmoil. Harvard economist Alberto Alesina's research is often cited, suggesting that spending cuts can lead to economic expansions, and the successful implementation of austerity measures in Greece is frequently mentioned. They also point out that austerity measures, though initially increasing the default premium, can improve the long-term economic performance of the economy. Supporters further argue that austerity regimes can lead to an export-led recovery by compressing domestic demand and expanding exports, as demonstrated in Ireland's case. They also maintain that reducing government spending is essential to manage national deficits and pay debts, as evidenced by the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility predictions. Lastly, historical examples such as the U.S. response to the 1920-21 recession under President Harding illustrate how austerity can effectively respond to economically challenging times."
"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of âexpansionary austerity:â fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
    - Evidence 2: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue âausterityâ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). Itâs the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
    - Evidence 2: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
    - Evidence 2: The budget deficit was 11% of GDP in 2009-10. It is now about 5.5% and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of UK predicts a surplus by the end of the decade..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%âgreater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..

**Proponents' Perspective:**

Proponents of the topic 'We should adopt atheism' provide arguments suggesting the personal benefits of adopting atheism, potential lack of evidence for God's existence, the immorality inherent in some religions, and the adequacy of science in explaining the Universe.

Proponents argue that atheism frees individuals from the dogmas and controversies that can be found in religious texts. They point out that without religion, people won't have to worry about divine judgement or living according to strict religious moral codes (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 1). They also insist that atheism should be the default position given the lack of concrete evidence for God's existence. They highlight that an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God would naturally make his presence known, which seems not to be the case (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 2).

Furthermore, proponents contend that some religions can encourage immoral behavior, citing teachings about slavery in the Bible and immoral acts committed in the name of Christianity and Islam (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 3). Finally, they argue that science provides a more satisfying and verifiable explanation of the Universe than religion, alluding to the views of Nobel laureate Stephen Weinberg and renowned biologist Richard Dawkins (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 4)."

    - Evidence 1: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you donât pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
    - Evidence 2: I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 2: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each humanâs requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that thatâs a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 2: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And thatâs only scratching the surface..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
    - Evidence 2: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
","Proponents' Perspective:

Proponents of the topic 'We should adopt atheism' provide arguments suggesting the personal benefits of adopting atheism, potential lack of evidence for God's existence, the immorality inherent in some religions, and the adequacy of science in explaining the Universe.

Proponents argue that atheism frees individuals from the dogmas and controversies that can be found in religious texts. They point out that without religion, people won't have to worry about divine judgement or living according to strict religious moral codes (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 1). They also insist that atheism should be the default position given the lack of concrete evidence for God's existence. They highlight that an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God would naturally make his presence known, which seems not to be the case (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 2).

Furthermore, proponents contend that some religions can encourage immoral behavior, citing teachings about slavery in the Bible and immoral acts committed in the name of Christianity and Islam (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 3). Finally, they argue that science provides a more satisfying and verifiable explanation of the Universe than religion, alluding to the views of Nobel laureate Stephen Weinberg and renowned biologist Richard Dawkins (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 4).",
"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
    - Evidence 2: Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
    - Evidence 2: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
","Opponents of the motion ""We should adopt libertarianism"" present five main claims:

Claim 1 posits that libertarianism is harmful to economic growth. They highlight that proponents of libertarianism often ignore market failures and propose laissez-faire capitalism. Evidence includes criticism that laissez-faire capitalism leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, as well as a statement from Adam Smith that the system is complex and administered without conscious purpose.

Claim 2 argues that libertarianism negatively affects minorities and the disadvantaged. Philosopher James P. Sterba suggests that the non-interference stance of libertarianism disproportionately impacts the poor, who should morally have the right to take from the surplus possessions of the rich to meet basic needs.

Claim 3 asserts that libertarianism is unjust and inequitable. Critics argue that markets can fail to meet social needs and result in unequal outcomes, as exemplified by the rise in income inequality in most OECD countries despite neoliberal policies.

Claim 4 argues that libertarianism eliminates necessary laws, infrastructure, and government services, citing environmental degradation and natural resource depletion due to lack of regulation as examples.

Finally, claim 5 emphasizes the role of government in protecting citizen rights, such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly, and in combating climate change.","Opponents of the motion ""We should adopt libertarianism"" present five main claims:

On the other hand, supporters of the motion assert four main claims:

Claim 1 states that libertarianism boosts economic growth, with evidence from organizations such as Americans for Limited Government and economists like James Shikwati who highlight the role of reduced taxation and freedom of trade.

Claim 2 argues that libertarianism promotes political freedom, citing the protection of property and individual rights as fundamental to a just and free society.

Claim 3 asserts that libertarianism enhances happiness and fulfillment. Advocates argue that by allowing free association and personal responsibility, individuals can pursue their own interests and goals, which promotes well-being.

- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.

Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..

4. *Safety Concerns*: Supporters of the ban highlight the potential for abuse of cloning technology (Council of Europe, 2008), and the health risks to cloned animals, including genetic abnormalities and premature death (Nature Reviews Genetics, 2003)."
"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..

**Supporters' Stance:**

1. *Ethical Violations:* Supporters of the ban argue that PMCs are prone to ethical violations and crimes, with the Congressional Research Service reporting unlawful killings by PMCs in 2010, and the Journal of Business Ethics highlighting potential conflicts of interest in 2008.

2. *Lack of Professionalism:* Amnesty International in 2009 revealed that PMCs have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, decreasing operational professionalism. The Congressional Research Service (2009) adds that limited transparency around PMC operations further impedes professionalism.

3. *Questionable Loyalty:* A 2007 Human Rights Watch report indicates that the opaque nature of PMCs can lead to actions against the hiring country's best interest. The Journal of Business Ethics (2008) suggests a potential conflict of interest when serving clients and broader societal interests, leading to trust issues.

4. *Profit-driven:* A 2006 report by the International Peace Institute claimed that unregulated PMCs often prioritize profit over other considerations. The Project on Government Oversight echoed this concern in 2008, noting the difficulty in monitoring profit-driven activities due to limited transparency.

5. *Escalating Conflict:* The Congressional Research Service in 2009 and Amnesty International in 2009 both suggest that PMCs may escalate and prolong conflicts, due to the lack of accountability and increased militarization they introduce."

","Debate Summary:

Topic: We should ban private military companies

Supporters' Stance:

Ethical Violations: Supporters of the ban argue that PMCs are prone to ethical violations and crimes, with the Congressional Research Service reporting unlawful killings by PMCs in 2010, and the Journal of Business Ethics highlighting potential conflicts of interest in 2008.

Lack of Professionalism: Amnesty International in 2009 revealed that PMCs have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, decreasing operational professionalism. The Congressional Research Service (2009) adds that limited transparency around PMC operations further impedes professionalism.

Questionable Loyalty: A 2007 Human Rights Watch report indicates that the opaque nature of PMCs can lead to actions against the hiring country's best interest. The Journal of Business Ethics (2008) suggests a potential conflict of interest when serving clients and broader societal interests, leading to trust issues.

Profit-driven: A 2006 report by the International Peace Institute claimed that unregulated PMCs often prioritize profit over other considerations. The Project on Government Oversight echoed this concern in 2008, noting the difficulty in monitoring profit-driven activities due to limited transparency.

Escalating Conflict: The Congressional Research Service in 2009 and Amnesty International in 2009 both suggest that PMCs may escalate and prolong conflicts, due to the lack of accountability and increased militarization they introduce.",

**Topic: 'We should ban the use of child actors'**

Opponents of the ban put forth several strong arguments. They propose that:

1. Acting may be a child's dream. The American Psychological Association (2010) and the Drama Teachers Association of America (2011) have both presented reports indicating that acting can help children express their emotions and pursue a career in performing arts, given their natural talent.

2. Child performers are necessary for certain roles. The Actors Equity Association's report (2014) and a study in the Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism (2016) suggest that child actors make productions more engaging and aid in the development of crucial character arcs.

On the other hand, supporters of the ban argue:

1. Being a performer may harm the child's education. According to the Journal of Adolescence (2018) and the American Psychological Association (2017), child actors may experience long-term negative effects on their personal, professional, and academic lives due to high stress levels.

2. Child performers are at risk of exploitation. Evidence from the Journal of Youth and Adolescence (2014) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (2016) suggests that child actors may face human trafficking risks, physical harm, and a lack of proper care and support.

3. Child performers may lose their childhood. Studies have shown that child actors might lose their innocence due to exposure to adult themes and the intense pressure of the entertainment industry (Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 2014; National Child Traumatic Stress Network, 2010).

4. Child performers may experience high levels of pressure leading to burnout and mental health issues like depression and anxiety (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016; Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 2014).

5. Child performers tend to develop problems later in life, such as identity crises and difficulty adjusting to life outside the industry, as evidenced by the struggles of former child actor Herbert.

Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice: Affirmative action, as critiqued by the lawsuit against Harvard and Hardin's book, can inadvertently perpetuate racial prejudice.
Affirmative action reduces quality: Data from the University of Texas and graduation rates from higher education indicate that affirmative action might not be equipping minority students with the necessary tools to succeed, leading to disparities in academic performance and graduation rates.",

They present evidence from the International Monetary Fund (2019) and the International Labour Organization (2012) that suggest mandatory retirement stimulates economic growth and boosts employment opportunities for younger people by making room in the workforce.

Supporters' Argument:

Supporters of the motion believe that mandatory retirement has several negative impacts. Their arguments include the following points:

1. Decreases institutional knowledge: They reference commercial airline pilots in the US and successful businessman Greene's employment policies as examples of where mandatory retirement might lead to loss of experience and institutional knowledge.

2. Harms the economy: Evidence from the International Monetary Fund (2019) and the International Labour Organization (2012) shows that mandatory retirement can limit labor market flexibility and lead to inefficient use of human capital.

3. Discriminatory: The World Economic Forum (2016) and Harvard Business Review (2017) studies suggest that mandatory retirement promotes intergenerational inequity and can decrease older workers' sense of purpose.

4. Reduces quality of life for retirees: Research published in The Gerontologist and the Journal of Gerontology suggests that mandatory retirement can lead to decreased social connections, increased feelings of loneliness, and decreased psychological well-being.

5. Retirement should be at will: They suggest, based on studies by the World Economic Forum (2016) and the American Association of Retired Persons (2010), that allowing people to retire when they are ready can reduce the risk of poverty in old age and supports active aging."

"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..
","Debate Summary:

Opponents of the motion ""We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons"" argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. They put forth the principle of deterrence as a key strategy in maintaining peace, having done so for nearly seven decades (Evidence 1). To further substantiate this claim, they draw attention to the conflict in Ukraine, asserting that the invasion did not indicate the failure of nuclear deterrence, but instead illustrated the importance of nuclear protection. In this example, the opponents argue that the boundaries set by nuclear deterrence, as seen with NATO and Russia, prevent major, frontal military attacks (Evidence 2).","Debate Summary:

On the other hand, advocates for the abolition of nuclear weapons propose two main arguments. The first argument emphasizes the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands.

They further argue that even those entrusted with nuclear weapons, like presidents, can pose a risk due to unforeseen personal crises or mental health issues (Evidence 2). 

Their second argument focuses on the potential of nuclear weapons to provoke or escalate disastrous military action. Using historical events like the Cuban missile crisis, they argue that escalating tensions significantly increase the likelihood of unfortunate incidents leading to large-scale problems (Evidence 1). They also draw attention to a more recent event where contact was lost with 50 missiles, demonstrating that even current safeguards may not prevent accidental launches or false alarms, which highlights the persistent risks associated with nuclear weapons (Evidence 2)."
"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. âThese materials arenât going away and more states are interested in developing them,â said Mr Herbach..
    - Evidence 2: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps itâs breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis â so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like âSoviet Sub Captainâ¦Crisisâ) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
    - Evidence 2: David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack.

"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
    - Evidence 2: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
    - Evidence 2: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
","Summary of the Opposition to 'We should fight urbanization':

Opponents of fighting urbanization present a strong case based on the potential opportunities and benefits that urbanization brings to individuals, the economy, and even the environment. They argue that cities offer numerous opportunities, using examples such as Japan's urbanization during the 20th century that provided better job prospects and education. Further evidence comes from Sihanoukville, where urbanization is expected to create economic opportunities leading to increased migration.

The second claim focuses on urbanization's potential for economic growth. This argument emphasizes that even overurbanization can result in positives such as more efficient economics due to scale, technological advancements, and increased occupational mobility. As proof, they cite the privatization of agriculture in China and the influx of international investment.

The last claim addresses environmental benefits. Despite the perceived strain urbanization puts on the environment, opponents argue that it drives green technology innovation and ultimately contributes to the green economy. Furthermore, they present the idea that urban productivity significantly exceeds that of rural areas, leading to the production of the same output with fewer resources, hence reducing the ecological footprint."," Summary of the Opposition to 'We should fight urbanization':

Summary of the Support for 'We should fight urbanization':

Supporters of the motion believe that urbanization has significant drawbacks and should therefore be fought. They argue that restricting migration could economically and socially benefit people in rural areas. This is supported by evidence from India, where protecting natural resources effectively prevented rural-urban migration. They also refer to Venezuela's urbanization, which led to neglect and abandonment of rural areas, making the country a net food importer despite its rich arable lands.

The second argument put forth states that urbanization leads to increased crime rates. They back this up by referencing the rise in crime rates during the industrialization era and the increase in criminal activities in rapidly urbanizing areas like Bopal & Ghuma.

Supporters also claim that urbanization negatively impacts the environment, causing increased degradation of marine environments due to coastal development and contaminating water quality due to the increase in metals and organic contaminants.

Lastly, supporters argue that urbanization puts a significant strain on city resources, leading to overpopulation, inadequate housing, and sanitary facilities, and limited access to educational facilities. They use UNESCO reports and case studies of fast urbanization processes leading to the formation of irregular neighborhoods to substantiate this claim."
"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:

    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience.

- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ârandomâ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters.

The opposition argues that compulsory voting infringes on a citizen's right not to vote, undermines the validity of abstention, and may result in uninformed voting.

Claim 1: Abstaining from a vote also reflects personal preferences.

Evidence: Herbert Spencer's critique of Blackstone's doctrine that any form of participation, including abstention, is considered consent to the winning candidate's rule. Abstention can indicate ambivalence, mild disapproval, political expedience, or a feeling of being inadequately informed.

**Stance 2: Support for compulsory voting**

Supporters of compulsory voting argue that it increases representation, promotes political interest, and upholds the civic duty to vote.

**Claim 1:** Compulsory voting increases representation.

Evidence: Mandatory voting obliges candidates to address all voters, preventing political skewing towards the affluent or well-educated demographic, as often happens in voluntary voting systems like in the U.S. Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. argue that boosting turnout, especially among underrepresented groups, enhances justice and representation.

**Claim 2:** Compulsory voting incites greater interest in politics.

"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the Board representative is quoted as having said that we might end up in the next 10 or 20 years with our psychiatric hospitals filled with people who have problems with cannabis, and that a recent study by the British Lung Foundation found smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes..
    - Evidence 2: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
    - Evidence 2: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..

    - Evidence 2: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..

    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..

","Topic: 'We should legalize cannabis'

Summary of Opponent's Stance:

Opponents of cannabis legalization present four main arguments.

First, they claim that cannabis is harmful to the body. They assert that heavy cannabis usage can lead to significant lung damage, as per the British Lung Foundation's research. Furthermore, Dutch research suggests that increased THC content in cannabis can lead to impaired psychomotor skills, especially in younger or inexperienced users.

The second argument posits that cannabis use contributes to accidents, specifically vehicular crashes. Multiple studies, including one published in the American Journal of Public Health, show that the rate of fatal crashes involving cannabis and alcohol consumption has more than doubled over the past two decades.

Third, opponents see cannabis as a gateway to harder drugs and potential addiction. They cite a study involving same-sex twins that revealed a higher probability of one twin moving on to harder drugs if they smoked cannabis before age 17.

Lastly, they argue that legalizing cannabis could lead to increased usage among underage teenagers. They cite historical data from Alaska, where marijuana legalization resulted in the state's teens using cannabis at double the national rate, eventually leading residents to vote for re-criminalization of cannabis in 1990.","Topic: 'We should legalize cannabis'

Summary of Opponent's Stance:

Opponents of cannabis legalization present four main arguments. 

First, they claim that cannabis is harmful to the body. They assert that heavy cannabis usage can lead to significant lung damage, as per the British Lung Foundation's research. Furthermore, Dutch research suggests that increased THC content in cannabis can lead to impaired psychomotor skills, especially in younger or inexperienced users. 

The second argument posits that cannabis use contributes to accidents, specifically vehicular crashes.

Summary of Supporters' Stance:

Supporters of cannabis legalization also present five key arguments.

First, they posit that legal substances, like alcohol and tobacco, pose even greater health risks than cannabis. They argue that occasional use of certain illicit drugs, including cannabis, may not lead to significant health or social problems, unlike persistent alcohol or tobacco usage.

Second, they suggest that legalizing cannabis could bring significant financial benefits. One study estimates that California saved almost one billion dollars between 1976 and 1988 due to decriminalization of cannabis.

Third, supporters argue that cannabis can have therapeutic benefits. They claim that the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis is inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which suggests that cannabis does have medical benefits.

Fourth, they contend that legalization could lead to effective regulation. They argue that controlled supply and application of drug laws can lead to selective social control, potentially reducing use among vulnerable demographics.

Finally, they propose that legalization would reduce black-market activities and associated criminal behavior. They cite a study by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy, which found that drug law enforcement tends to increase drug-related violence, and therefore alternative models, such as legalization, might be necessary. They also suggest that decriminalization could drastically reduce crime and improve public health."
"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
    - Evidence 2: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer Â¬Â£6.7 billion..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 Â¬âC, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
    - Evidence 2: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
    - Evidence 2: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..

**Supporters' Stance:**

Supporters of the legalization of prostitution argue that it can lead to economic growth, improved conditions for sex workers, industry regulation, and safety for the women involved.

1. The legalization of sex work can boost the economy. Historical examples such as Seattle's city founder, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, show that regulated prostitution can be a functional part of an economy.

2. Legalizing prostitution can increase benefits for sex workers, such as healthcare, safe sex practices, and the possibility of unionization. The Ministry of Justice has previously considered legalizing prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income, while ethnographical research from the University of Porto supports this move to improve the condition of women in the industry.

3. Legalization allows for regulation of the profession. Advocates, such as Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman, argue that acknowledging and legalizing prostitution can provide safer, regulated, and revenue-generating sex work. Dutch citizens overwhelmingly support this view, considering prostitution as a valid occupation.

4. Legalized sex work can make the profession safer for women. Studies from China and New Zealand reveal that intervention projects promoting safe sex behaviors have had positive effects on the health and safety of sex workers.

5. Legalization respects individual autonomy and validates sex work as a personal choice over one's body. Mariska Majoor, a former sex worker, argues that prostitution is a valid profession and a way of making money. This perspective is backed by a 2009 study which shows that sex work has become normalized among the surveyed prostitutes."
"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:

    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
    - Evidence 2: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 2: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.

"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world â the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
    - Evidence 2: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like âGodâ and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
    - Evidence 2: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
    - Evidence 2: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
","Opposition's Stance: 'We should not legalize sex selection'

The opponents of legalizing sex selection base their argument on three central claims.

Firstly, they claim that sex selection can exacerbate gender imbalances. As evidence, they cite the substantial gender disparities in certain regions around the globe, such as India and China, where the preference for sons over daughters has led to a distorted male-to-female ratio. This is underscored by statistics that indicate 25% more male births than female births in some areas since the 1990s, reflecting persistent discrimination against females.

Secondly, they argue that sex selection only reaffirms gender biases and stereotypes. The act of parents playing ""God"" and deliberately choosing their child's gender breaks the natural law of conception, according to the opposition. They also reject the argument for 'family balancing' as a suitable use of sex selection, arguing that it often harbors sexist motivations and promotes consumerist tendencies in family creation.

Thirdly, they express concerns that sex selection could lead to an increase in abortions and even infanticide. They cite evidence indicating that son preference is correlated with repeat abortions, while highlighting the case of two doctors in Britain who were not prosecuted despite agreeing to perform a sex-selective abortion."," **Opposition's Stance: 'We should not legalize sex selection'**

**Supporters' Stance: 'We should legalize sex selection'**

Supporters of sex selection legalization, on the other hand, present several counterarguments.

First, they argue that parents should have the freedom to select their child's sex. This freedom, they believe, can help parents plan their families more effectively, ensuring they are capable of providing proper nutrition and education. Additionally, it allows them to avoid passing gender-specific diseases onto their offspring.

Secondly, supporters suggest that sex selection aids in family planning. Particularly in regions where family size is limited, like China, the ability to select a child's gender gives parents the opportunity to have the gender of child they desire without exceeding population limits.

Thirdly, advocates believe sex selection can foster a happier, more complete family. The opportunity to have a child of a desired gender can enhance familial love and satisfaction. Moreover, it can provide solace for parents who have lost a child, giving them the option to have another child of the same gender.

Fourthly, supporters maintain that sex selection can help prevent diseases. With technologies such as Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD), embryos can be selected based on health factors, reducing the likelihood of genetic disorders and increasing chances of successful pregnancy.

Lastly, supporters argue that legalizing sex selection could actually prevent abortions or infanticide. They refer to horrific instances of gendercide, the killing of a newborn due to their gender, as justification. With the ability to select their child's gender, parents could avoid finding themselves with an undesired gender and resorting to such tragic outcomes."
"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 2: Choosing babyâs gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isnât always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the fatherâs family name..
    - Evidence 2: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as âgendercideâ). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..

He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson.

Opponents of the prohibition of flag burning argue that it is a potent form of expression, protest, and critique, referencing the case of Gregory Lee Johnson as a demonstration of how flag burning is a form of expression protected by the First Amendment. They also invoke the words of Justice Brennan, who asserted that even offensive or disagreeable ideas cannot be prohibited by the government, and that flag burning falls under this umbrella of protected expressive activity.

Supporters of the prohibition, on the other hand, argue for the sanctity and respect of national symbols, such as flags. They point to the legislation in countries like Austria, where flag desecration is illegal. Additionally, they posit that flag burning is an inflammatory act that deserves legal prohibition. They reference laws like the one in Hong Kong where flag desecration is considered a serious offense, and highlight the offensive nature of flag burning to support their stance.

**Topic: Prohibition of Women in Combat**

Opponents of this prohibition believe in equality between men and women and argue that women are an asset in combat. They point to evidence of women's increasing participation in economic activities and their lower rates of disciplinary problems as indicators of their potential effectiveness in combat roles. Additionally, they argue that women possess unique skills and strategies beneficial to combat situations, citing historical examples like the Soviet Army during WWII and women serving as Special Operations Executive agents. They also propose that women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat, using the example of Maria Bochkareva's WomenÕs Battalion of Death in WWI and the historical service of women in the U.S. military.

They further argue that women should have the choice to serve in combat if they wish to do so, citing studies like the one conducted by the British Ministry of Defense in 2010 that found women performed on par with men. They also posit that women should be accepted into combat roles if they can pass the required tests, advocating for gender-free fitness standards like those introduced by the Army, where selection is based on ability, not gender."

"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
    - Evidence 2: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. Itâs essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
    - Evidence 2: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the first instance of organized womenâs soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 2: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Womenâs Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkarevaâs autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Womenâs Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no manâs land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalionâs lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 2: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
    - Evidence 2: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests â a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each roleâs requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..

"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 2: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers canât meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
    - Evidence 2: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
    - Evidence 2: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
    - Evidence 2: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or â more practically â that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You canât have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
    - Evidence 2: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..

"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Muskâs SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 2: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezosâ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
    - Evidence 2: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, âThe SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.â Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the worldâs recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
    - Evidence 2: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..
    - Evidence 2: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..

"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Itâs time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? Iâll readily admit Iâm for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me â but this isnât the space communityâs decision, or in fact, any single nationâs decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration isnât simply a sign of humanityâs hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, itâs also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.

    - Evidence 1: After Gagarinâs 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
    - Evidence 2: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040âand as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
    - Evidence 2: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planetâs life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. Itâs the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earthâs wellbeing. Itâs safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
    - Evidence 2: Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites â which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path â to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns..

","Summary of the Debate

Topic: Should We Subsidize Vocational Education?

Opponents' Stance and Arguments:

The opponents of subsidizing vocational education put forward several reasons:

Diversion of resources: They argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes. The American Federation of Teachers in 2019 found that many vocational programs may not provide the skills and knowledge required for the 21st-century workforce, thereby offering limited economic benefits.

Costly investment: They also contend that subsidizing vocational education is expensive, potentially draining resources from other crucial areas like financial aid, student support services, and research and development, as suggested by a 2019 report from the National Skills Coalition.

Profession influx: Further, they assert that subsidies lead to an influx in vocational fields. A study analyzing the effects of subsidies in Germany showed an increase in vocational enrollment and corresponding decline in academic programs, leading to a potential oversaturation in certain vocational professions.

Career progression limitations: Finally, opponents argue that vocational education is not a good career choice due to limitations in advancement opportunities. A 2019 report from the American Federation of Teachers found that many vocational programs do not provide pathways for career advancement, making it challenging for workers to ascend the career ladder.","**Summary of the Debate**
