"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying supporters argue that the recent trends towards the use of the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland and press stories regarding botched suicides and do-it-yourself advice would be stopped because individuals would know that when and if they wished to finally request an assisted death in the UK, it would be available as arranged..
    - Evidence 3: A qualitative study using narrative interviews was conducted throughout the UK. Results shows that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most people. Those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a right. Some had multiple reasons, including pain and anticipated pain, fear of indignity, loss of control and cognitive impairment. Those who did not want to be a burden also had other reasons for wanting euthanasia. Suicide was contemplated by a few, who would have preferred a change in the law to allow them to end their lives with medical help and in the company of family or friends..
    - Evidence 4: Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment..
    - Evidence 5: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient..
    - Evidence 2: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 3: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In Washington v. Glucksberg (1997), a group of Washington residents asserted that a state law banning assisted suicide was unconstitutional on its face..
    - Evidence 2: Dame Joan Bakewell, the British government's 'Voice of Older People', said that the current British law on assisted suicide was 'a mess' and that Nitschke should have been made more welcome in the UK..
    - Evidence 3: The use of Advanced Decisions can help significantly but they also believe that if a right to an Assisted Death is available then the very knowledge of this fact can alleviate many of the worries an individual might have..
    - Evidence 4: Dignity in Dying argue that if a person does not wish to take advantage of a change in the law which would allow for an assisted death then that is down to personal choice..
    - Evidence 5: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
    - Evidence 2: Opponents have presented a story of Oregon resident Jeanette Hall, who was diagnosed with cancer and given 6 months to a year to live. She wanted the act of assisted death to be performed..
    - Evidence 3: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 4: Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned..
    - Evidence 5: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..

","Assisted suicide is a controversial topic that has been debated for many years. Those who support assisted suicide argue that it gives terminally ill patients the right to die with dignity and control over their own death. They also argue that it can reduce suffering and improve the quality of life for those who are dying. Opponents of assisted suicide argue that it is morally wrong to help someone end their own life. They also argue that it could lead to abuse, such as elderly people being pressured to end their lives by their families or caregivers.

Here are some of the arguments in favor of assisted suicide:

Dignity: Those who support assisted suicide argue that it gives terminally ill patients the right to die with dignity. They believe that no one should be forced to suffer through a terminal illness, and that they should have the right to end their own life on their own terms.
Control: Assisted suicide gives terminally ill patients control over their own death. They can choose when and how they want to die, and they can do so in a way that is peaceful and comfortable.
Reduced suffering: Assisted suicide can reduce suffering for both the patient and their loved ones. The patient can die without having to endure pain or other medical complications, and their loved ones can be spared the emotional pain of watching them suffer.
Improved quality of life: Assisted suicide can improve the quality of life for those who are dying. It can give them peace of mind knowing that they have a way to end their life if their suffering becomes unbearable. It can also allow them to focus on spending time with their loved ones and making the most of the time they have left.
Here are some of the arguments against assisted suicide:

Morality: Opponents of assisted suicide argue that it is morally wrong to help someone end their own life. They believe that life is sacred and that no one has the right to take it away, even their own.
Abuse: Opponents of assisted suicide argue that it could lead to abuse. They worry that elderly people could be pressured to end their lives by their families or caregivers, or that people with disabilities could be coerced into suicide.
** slippery slope:** Opponents of assisted suicide argue that it could lead to a slippery slope, where other forms of euthanasia, such as involuntary euthanasia, become more accepted.
The debate over assisted suicide is complex and there are strong arguments on both sides.

","The debate on assisted suicide is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides. Those who support assisted suicide argue that it is a patient's right to choose to end their own life, especially if they are terminally ill and in pain. They also argue that assisted suicide can be a compassionate option for patients who are suffering and who feel that they have no other choice.

Those who oppose assisted suicide argue that it is morally wrong to help someone end their own life. They also argue that assisted suicide can be abused, and that it can lead to a slippery slope where more and more people are pressured to end their lives.

The evidence supporting the claim that assisted suicide should be a criminal offense is as follows:

Assisted suicide can be abused. For example, a patient who is feeling depressed or suicidal may be more likely to choose assisted suicide if it is legal. Additionally, there is a risk that doctors or other healthcare professionals may pressure patients to choose assisted suicide, even if they are not truly ready to die.
Assisted suicide can lead to a slippery slope. Once assisted suicide is legal, it may be difficult to draw a line between assisted suicide and euthanasia. Euthanasia is when a doctor intentionally ends a patient's life, even if the patient is not competent to make their own decision. If assisted suicide is legal, it may be easier for doctors to justify euthanasia, even in cases where the patient is not terminally ill or in pain.
Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role. Doctors are supposed to heal patients, not help them die. Assisted suicide undermines the trust that patients have in their doctors, and it can make it more difficult for doctors to provide compassionate care to patients who are dying.
In conclusion, there are strong arguments on both sides of the debate on assisted suicide. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not they believe that assisted suicide should be legal. However, the evidence suggests that assisted suicide can be abused, and that it can lead to a slippery slope where more and more people are pressured to end their lives.","The debate on assisted suicide is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.

"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The agency provides Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
    - Evidence 2: Gallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001..
    - Evidence 3: The agency provides Lebanon School District, charter schools, the district's home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 3: “Differentiation is what homeschooling is all about,” Sherry Bushnell told me. She and herhusband founded the National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, an internationalorganization that supports parents who educate special-needs children at home. They homeschool their sonJordan, a 13-year-old boy with Down's syndrome, along with his nine siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
    - Evidence 5: The efficiency of homeschooling – and the fact that you don’t have to follow the national curriculum or the typical timings of a school day – leaves you with time to spend broadening your child’s learning. You can make time for play, projects, real experiments, and the arts. Real-life skill building – including cooking, cleaning, volunteering, and learning to budget – could form a part of your school day. You could also choose to learn in different places, like museums, parks, and science centres..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.

Franklin commented that public schools are a 'sinking ship' and he believed that private and home schooling are a better alternative for Georgia..
    - Evidence 2: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 3: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.

The debate material consists of a topic; a stance; a series of arguments and evidence to support that argument. You do not need to use all of the evidence, just select the most appropriate one or more that are well-argued and well-persuaded. You may add background information as appropriate. The material for the debate as follow: 

 Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The agency provides Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
    - Evidence 2: Gallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001..
    - Evidence 3: The agency provides Lebanon School District, charter schools, the district's home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 3: “Differentiation is what homeschooling is all about,” Sherry Bushnell told me. She and herhusband founded the National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, an internationalorganization that supports parents who educate special-needs children at home. They homeschool their sonJordan, a 13-year-old boy with Down's syndrome, along with his nine siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
    - Evidence 5: The efficiency of homeschooling – and the fact that you don’t have to follow the national curriculum or the typical timings of a school day – leaves you with time to spend broadening your child’s learning. You can make time for play, projects, real experiments, and the arts. Real-life skill building – including cooking, cleaning, volunteering, and learning to budget – could form a part of your school day. You could also choose to learn in different places, like museums, parks, and science centres..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Franklin was an opponent of public schools, stating on his weekly blog that, 'The State Has No Jurisdiction To Educate Our Children - Period!'Rep. Franklin commented that public schools are a 'sinking ship' and he believed that private and home schooling are a better alternative for Georgia..
    - Evidence 2: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 3: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.

"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Unschooling contrasts with other forms of home education in that the student's education is not directed by a teacher and curriculum..
    - Evidence 2: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 3: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 4: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although we acknowledged in the advantages section that homeschooled children do still develop socially, they naturally lose some interaction by spending more time at home. They may be out of touch with their peers, have fewer friends, and have less experience interacting with people from different backgrounds. Their view of the world could be very narrow and biased. In the worst cases, they could be brought up to be intolerant and misinformed, with little knowledge of general societal values. This could disadvantage them in the future..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 3: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse..
    - Evidence 2: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 3: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 4: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..

","Sure, here is a summary of the debate on whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory.

Opponents of mandatory vaccination argue that:

Vaccinations can be dangerous. They cite the examples of the chickenpox vaccine, which can cause pneumonia, and the flu vaccine, which is associated with a small risk of Guillain-Barr syndrome.
Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights. They argue that it violates the First Amendment right to freedom of religion and the right to bodily autonomy.
Routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy. They point to the fact that natural infection often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.
Proponents of mandatory vaccination argue that:

Vaccinations are safe and effective. They point to the fact that vaccines have been proven to prevent serious diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella.
Mandatory vaccination is necessary to protect public health. They argue that when too many people are unvaccinated, it creates an environment where diseases can spread easily.
Parents have a responsibility to protect their children from harm. They argue that parents who choose not to vaccinate their children are putting their children and others at risk.
The debate on whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory is a complex one. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not to vaccinate their children.

Here are some additional points that may be relevant to the debate:

Vaccinations are not 100% effective. Even if a child is vaccinated, there is still a small chance that they could get sick.
Some people have allergies or other medical conditions that make it impossible for them to be vaccinated.
There is a growing trend of vaccine hesitancy, which is the reluctance to vaccinate children. This trend is due to a number of factors, including concerns about the safety of vaccines, the spread of misinformation about vaccines, and the rise of social media.
The debate on whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory is likely to continue for some time. It is important to weigh the risks and benefits of vaccination carefully before making a decision.","Sure, here is a summary of the debate on whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory.

"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Two to three million deaths are prevented each year worldwide by vaccination, and an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if all recommended vaccines were used..
    - Evidence 2: In the twentieth century, there were 16,316 deaths from polio and 29,004 deaths from smallpox yearly in the United States; in 2012 there were no reported cases of polio or smallpox..
    - Evidence 3: Diphtheria killed 21,053 people yearly, measles killed 530,217 people yearly, mumps killed 162,344 people yearly, rubella killed 47,745 people yearly, and Hib killed 20,000 people yearly in the twentieth century United States; by 2012 each of these diseases were decreased by 99% because of vaccinations..
    - Evidence 4: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
    - Evidence 5: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 2: The American Academy of Pediatrics states that “most childhood vaccines are 90%-99% effective in preventing disease.”.
    - Evidence 3: According to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization, vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, which equates to roughly 285 children saved every hour..
    - Evidence 4: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..
    - Evidence 5: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 3: Those seeking to enforce compulsory vaccination argued that the public good overrode personal freedom, a view supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905, a landmark ruling which set a precedent for cases dealing with personal freedom and the public good..
    - Evidence 4: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
    - Evidence 5: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 2: As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant..
    - Evidence 3: In the same manner, children receiving vaccines against pneumococcus reduces pneumococcal disease incidence among younger, unvaccinated siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries..
    - Evidence 5: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization (WHO): 'After observation of study populations for periods of up to 20 years in Japan and 10 years in the United States, more than 90% of immunocompetent persons who were vaccinated as children were still protected from varicella.'.
    - Evidence 2: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
    - Evidence 3: Vaccination campaigns helped eradicate smallpox, which once killed as many as one in seven children in Europe, and have nearly eradicated polio..
    - Evidence 4: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..
    - Evidence 5: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..

The material for the debate as follow: 

 Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Two to three million deaths are prevented each year worldwide by vaccination, and an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if all recommended vaccines were used..
    - Evidence 2: In the twentieth century, there were 16,316 deaths from polio and 29,004 deaths from smallpox yearly in the United States; in 2012 there were no reported cases of polio or smallpox..
    - Evidence 3: Diphtheria killed 21,053 people yearly, measles killed 530,217 people yearly, mumps killed 162,344 people yearly, rubella killed 47,745 people yearly, and Hib killed 20,000 people yearly in the twentieth century United States; by 2012 each of these diseases were decreased by 99% because of vaccinations..
    - Evidence 4: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
    - Evidence 5: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 2: The American Academy of Pediatrics states that “most childhood vaccines are 90%-99% effective in preventing disease.”.
    - Evidence 3: According to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization, vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, which equates to roughly 285 children saved every hour..
    - Evidence 4: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..
    - Evidence 5: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 3: Those seeking to enforce compulsory vaccination argued that the public good overrode personal freedom, a view supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905, a landmark ruling which set a precedent for cases dealing with personal freedom and the public good..
    - Evidence 4: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
    - Evidence 5: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:

","Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory.

Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent infectious diseases. Vaccines work by exposing the body to a weakened or inactive form of a virus or bacteria, which helps the body develop immunity to the disease.

There is a wealth of evidence to support the effectiveness of vaccination. For example, the measles vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, and the polio vaccine is 99% effective at preventing polio.

Vaccination is also very safe. Serious side effects from vaccines are very rare. In fact, the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.

Routine child vaccinations are important for several reasons. First, they protect children from serious diseases. Second, they help to create herd immunity, which protects people who cannot be vaccinated, such as infants and people with weakened immune systems. Third, they help to reduce the spread of disease and prevent outbreaks.

For all of these reasons, routine child vaccinations should be mandatory.

Here are some specific arguments in support of mandatory vaccination:

Vaccination is effective. Vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing a wide range of infectious diseases, including measles, mumps, rubella, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), hepatitis B, and chickenpox.
Vaccination is safe. The risks of serious side effects from vaccines are very low. The most common side effects are mild and go away on their own.
Vaccination is necessary to protect others. When a large enough percentage of the population is vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, which protects people who cannot be vaccinated, such as infants and people with weakened immune systems.
Vaccination is a public health issue. The decision to vaccinate is not just a personal one. It is also a public health issue. When people choose not to vaccinate their children, they are putting not only their own children at risk, but also the children of others.
Here are some specific examples of how mandatory vaccination has benefited society:

Measles. Measles was once a common and deadly disease. In the early 1900s, there were millions of cases of measles reported each year in the United States. Thousands of people died from measles each year. In 1963, the measles vaccine was introduced. Since then, the number of cases of measles has decreased by 99%. There have been no deaths from measles in the United States since 2000.
Polio. Polio was once a major cause of paralysis in children. In the early 1950s, there were over 35,000 cases of polio reported each year in the United States. Thousands of children were paralyzed each year. In 1955, the polio vaccine was introduced. Since then, the number of cases of polio has decreased by 99.9%. There have been no cases of polio in the United States since 1979.
These are just two examples of how mandatory vaccination has benefited society. There are many other examples. Mandatory vaccination is a public health measure that has saved millions of lives and prevented countless cases of disease.","**Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory.**

","Should Social Media Platforms Be Regulated by the Government?

The debate over whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government is a complex one. There are strong arguments on both sides of the issue.

Arguments in favor of regulation

Social media platforms have become too powerful. They have a huge reach and influence over people's lives. They can be used to spread misinformation, hate speech, and other harmful content.
Social media platforms are not doing enough to moderate harmful content. They often rely on users to flag content that is harmful, but this system is not effective. Harmful content can stay up for days or even weeks before it is removed.
Government regulation is necessary to protect people from the harms caused by social media. Regulation could help to ensure that social media platforms are more transparent about their content moderation practices, and that they are more proactive in removing harmful content.
Arguments against regulation

Regulation could stifle free speech. Social media platforms are a vital platform for free speech. Regulation could lead to social media platforms censoring content that they disagree with.
Regulation could be ineffective. It is difficult to regulate the content of social media platforms. Harmful content can be easily shared and reshared, making it difficult to track down and remove.
Government regulation is not necessary. Social media platforms are already taking steps to address the harms caused by their platforms. They are investing in new technologies to detect and remove harmful content, and they are working with governments to develop new policies.
Conclusion

The debate over whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government is likely to continue for some time. There are strong arguments on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, it is up to policymakers to decide whether regulation is the best way to address the harms caused by social media.

In addition to the arguments presented above, there are a number of other factors that policymakers should consider when making a decision about whether to regulate social media platforms. These factors include:

The potential impact of regulation on innovation. Social media platforms are constantly innovating and developing new ways to connect people. Regulation could stifle this innovation.
The cost of regulation. Regulation could be costly for social media platforms. They would need to invest in new technologies and processes to comply with regulations.
The public's willingness to accept regulation. The public may not be willing to accept regulation of social media platforms. They may view regulation as an infringement on their freedom of speech.
Policymakers must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of regulation before making a decision. There is no easy answer to the question of whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government.","**Should Social Media Platforms Be Regulated by the Government?**

"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On 8 February, the DCMS announced that the Bill would be strengthened so that all providers who published or placed pornographic content on their services would need to prevent children from accessing that content..
    - Evidence 2: Also in 2020, EPIC and coalition of child advocacy, consumer, and privacy groups filed a complaint urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and penalize TikTok for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act..
    - Evidence 3: Companies are obligated to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act if they know that children under age 13 use their platforms. The law, known as COPPA, gives parents control over what information online platforms can collect about their kids..
    - Evidence 4: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
    - Evidence 5: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: “Platforms should be transparent about their content moderation decisions, prevent dangerous disinformation from going viral and avoid unsafe products being offered on marketplaces,” said Margrethe Vestager, who has spearheaded much of the bloc’s work to regulate the tech industry as the executive vice president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union..
    - Evidence 2: The European Union reached a deal on Saturday on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation..
    - Evidence 3: A recent Gallup poll found that only 37 percent believe “news organizations generally get the facts straight.” This is down from about half of the country who felt that way in 1998..
    - Evidence 4: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
    - Evidence 5: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If we believe news headlines, social media is responsible for many of the major scourges of modern life. It is coarsening our political discourse, leading to polarization and division. It exposes vulnerable people to extremist ideology, driving them toward violence. Social media is addictive, can damage our body image and sense of self-worth..
    - Evidence 2: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 3: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
    - Evidence 4: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'This proportionate new framework will ensure we don’t put unnecessary burdens on small businesses but give large digital businesses robust rules of the road to follow so we can seize the brilliance of modern technology to improve our lives.'.
    - Evidence 5: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Along those lines, Senator Amy Klobuchar has proposed legislation to have the National Science Foundation identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material..
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
    - Evidence 3: Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'We will not allow child sexual abuse, terrorist material and other harmful content to fester on online platforms. Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.'.

That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 5: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.

"Given the topic: 'The USA is a good country to live in', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The US has unfair health and education policies.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: About a quarter of adults say they or family member in their household have not filled a prescription, cut pills in half, or skipped doses of medicine in the last year because of the cost, with larger shares of those in households with lower incomes, Black and Hispanic adults, and women reporting this..
    - Evidence 2: Among those under age 65, uninsured adults are much more likely to say affording health care costs is difficult (85%) compared to those with health insurance coverage (47%)..
    - Evidence 3: Additionally, at least six in ten Black adults (60%) and Hispanic adults (65%) report difficulty affording health care costs compared to about four in ten White adults (39%)..
    - Evidence 4: Adults in households with annual incomes under $40,000 are more than three times as likely as adults in households with incomes over $90,000 to say it is difficult to afford their health care costs (69% v. 21%)..
    - Evidence 5: In 2007, 8.1 million children under 18 years old were without health insurance. Children in poverty and Hispanic children were more likely to be uninsured..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Over the summer, 76% of Republicans (including independents who lean to the party) felt the U.S. had done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, compared with just 29% of those who do not identify with the Republican Party..

    - Evidence 3: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
    - Evidence 4: According to Carothers and O’Donohue, a “powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion renders America’s divisions unusually encompassing and profound..
    - Evidence 5: In their study of polarization across nations, Thomas Carothers and Andrew O’Donohue argue that polarization runs particularly deep in the U.S. in part because American polarization is 'especially multifaceted.'.
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: I struggle so much with this insane work culture in America. We are so freaking proud of working ourselves to death..
    - Evidence 2: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
    - Evidence 3: In a recent opinion piece for The New York Times, Anne-Marie Slaughter laments the state of the current American workplace, which she considers toxic by nature..
    - Evidence 4: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
    - Evidence 5: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045). Simply living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, researchers suggest..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Americans with less than five-figure incomes pay an effective payroll tax rate of 14.1 percent, while those making seven-figure incomes or more pay just 1.9 percent..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers estimate, for example, that 80 percent of families saw the share of budgets dedicated to spending on needs such as housing and health care increase by more than 7 percentage points between 1984 and 2014, potentially crowding out spending on other categories like leisure, longer-term investments in education, and saving for retirement..
    - Evidence 3: Further, a 2019 Pew survey found that 35 percent of middle-income families frequently worry about paying their bills; similarly, 37 percent worry about the cost of health care for themselves and their families..
    - Evidence 4: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
    - Evidence 5: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The ownership of wealth among households in the U.S. became somewhat more concentrated since the 1980s. The top 10% of households controlled 68.2 percent of the total wealth in 1983 and 73.1% of the total wealth in 2007..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers recently tested 355,000 White and 77,000 Black Americans and discovered a strong link between a fear of diseases and implicit/explicit racial bias. The tests found that 'among white people who are highly averse to germs, images that evoke thoughts of infectious disease also increase bias against African Americans.'.
    - Evidence 3: From the U.S. Census Bureau, the official poverty rate in 2020 was 11.4 percent, up 1.0 percentage point from 10.5 percent in 2019..
    - Evidence 4: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
    - Evidence 5: The United States’ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019—the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany—according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The US has the highest rate of death by guns in the developed world, and more than double the gun ownership rates than Yemen, a country that has been embroiled in a civil war since 2014..
    - Evidence 2: More Americans have been killed by guns since 1968 than soldiers have died in all of America’s wars combined..
    - Evidence 3: An astounding 1.5 million Americans died by gunfire between 1986 and 2017..
    - Evidence 4: A country where, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 253 mass shootings in the country since the beginning of 2019. That’s more shootings than days. Two of those occurred over the weekend in less than 24 hours, first in El Paso, Texas followed by Dayton, Ohio, leaving 31 dead..
    - Evidence 5: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Since 1892, the United States has deported more immigrants (over 57 million) than any other nation..
    - Evidence 2: Nearly three in ten Asian Americans report experiencing racial slurs or jokes since the start of the pandemic, over 6,600 incidents of hate crime (including physical attacks on Asian elders) have been reported nationwide, and six women were murdered at three Asian-owned spas in Georgia in March 2021..
    - Evidence 3: There is an oversimplification of racism in America, because as sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva notes, there can be systemic racism without racists..
    - Evidence 4: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
    - Evidence 5: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..

Two of those occurred over the weekend in less than 24 hours, first in El Paso, Texas followed by Dayton, Ohio, leaving 31 dead..
    - Evidence 5: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Since 1892, the United States has deported more immigrants (over 57 million) than any other nation..
    - Evidence 2: Nearly three in ten Asian Americans report experiencing racial slurs or jokes since the start of the pandemic, over 6,600 incidents of hate crime (including physical attacks on Asian elders) have been reported nationwide, and six women were murdered at three Asian-owned spas in Georgia in March 2021..
    - Evidence 3: There is an oversimplification of racism in America, because as sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva notes, there can be systemic racism without racists..
    - Evidence 4: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
    - Evidence 5: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..
","The USA is a good country to live in, but it also has its fair share of problems. Some of the main arguments against the USA being a good country to live in include:

Unfair health and education policies: The USA has a two-tiered healthcare system, with those who can afford it receiving better care than those who cannot. The cost of education is also high, making it difficult for many people to afford college or graduate school.
Problematic/divisive political system: The USA has a highly polarized political system, with the two major parties increasingly at odds with each other. This can make it difficult to get anything done, and can lead to gridlock and dysfunction in government.
Negative culture: The USA has a culture that is often seen as materialistic, individualistic, and competitive. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and a lack of community.
High taxation/high costs of living: The USA has a high tax burden, and the cost of living is high in many parts of the country. This can make it difficult for people to make ends meet.
Inequality/poverty: The USA has a high level of inequality, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. This can lead to social unrest and a lack of opportunity for many people.
Unsafe: The USA has a high rate of gun violence, and is considered to be one of the most dangerous countries in the developed world.
Xenophobic/racist: The USA has a history of xenophobia and racism, and these problems still exist today. This can make it difficult for immigrants and people of color to feel welcome and safe in the USA.
Despite these problems, the USA is still a great country to live in. It has a strong economy, a vibrant culture, and a diverse population. It is also a land of opportunity, where anyone can achieve their dreams if they are willing to work hard.

Ultimately, whether or not the USA is a good country to live in depends on your individual circumstances and preferences. If you are looking for a country with a strong economy, a vibrant culture, and a diverse population, then the USA may be a good fit for you. However, if you are looking for a country with a more equitable healthcare system, a more affordable education system, and a less polarized political system, then you may want to consider other options.","The USA is a good country to live in, but it also has its fair share of problems.

"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
    - Evidence 2: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 3: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of clerical celibacy answer that God only calls men to the priesthood if they are capable. Those who are not called to the priesthood should seek other paths in life since they will be able to serve God better there..
    - Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 3: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption..
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of celibacy claim that Roman Catholic priests suffering sexual temptations are not likely to turn immediately to a teenage boy simply because Church discipline does not permit clergy to marry..
    - Evidence 5: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 3: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind.

","You are an expert debater. Follow the argumentative structure of the debate script to summarize the given debate material presented below. The debate material consists of a topic; a stance; a series of arguments and evidence to support that argument. You do not need to use all of the evidence, just select the most appropriate one or more that are well-argued and well-persuaded. You may add background information as appropriate. The material for the debate as follow: 

 Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
    - Evidence 2: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 3: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of clerical celibacy answer that God only calls men to the priesthood if they are capable. Those who are not called to the priesthood should seek other paths in life since they will be able to serve God better there..
    - Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 3: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption..
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of celibacy claim that Roman Catholic priests suffering sexual temptations are not likely to turn immediately to a teenage boy simply because Church discipline does not permit clergy to marry..
    - Evidence 5: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 3: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..

    - Evidence 2: The forerunner of the CƒåSH was the Jednota (Union of the Catholic Czechoslovak Clergy), which was founded in 1890 to promote modernist reforms in the Roman Catholic Church, such as use of the vernacular in the liturgy and the adoption of voluntary rather than compulsory clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 3: In a radio interview given on March 10, 2009, Egan stated that clerical celibacy in the Latin Rite could be open to discussion [REF]..
    - Evidence 4: Priestly celibacy is a practice rather than required dogma, and many at the time had expected that it might be relaxed together with other practices..
    - Evidence 5: Lakeland believes that Clerical celibacy should become optional and that change is inevitable..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent..
    - Evidence 2: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
    - Evidence 3: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Protestant apologists further argue that clerical celibacy violates the Biblical teaching in the First Epistle to Timothy:. The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
    - Evidence 3: Men are driven by testosterone to want sex, says John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University. Women are driven to a lesser degree by a mixture of testosterone and oestrogen, he explains. ’I'd regard celibacy as a totally abnormal state.’ Around 80-90% of men masturbate and it's likely that priests do too, he says. There is data to suggest that men who ejaculate more are less prone to prostate cancer, he says. You could argue that it's not so healthy to be celibate..
    - Evidence 4: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
    - Evidence 2: Ignoring his vow of celibacy, Urbain Grandier is known to have had sexual relationships with a number of women and to have acquired a reputation as a philanderer..
    - Evidence 3: Christoph Sch√∂nborn and Hans K√ºng have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church..
    - Evidence 4: In the wake of the clergy sexual abuse scandals, some critics have charged that priestly celibacy was a contributing factor.

"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: One  of  the  factors  that  influence  adolescent  psychological  well-being  is  the role  of  family and  parents.  In  general,  parental  marriage  contributes  to  the  well-being  of  children  (Ribar, 2015) because  of  the financial  support between  husband and  wife, social  interaction between family members, and  stability  of  the relationship  between  parents who  are  bound  in marriage commitments.  Shek  et  al.  (2014)  found  that  parental  marital  conditions,  family  functioning, relationships  between  children  and  parents,  and  communication  patterns  affect  the  level  of psychological well-being  of  adolescents..
    - Evidence 2: Children raised in intact married families tend to earn higher grades than those in non-intact families.1) For example, kindergarten children from married families have higher reading scores than those from cohabiting families.2) Parents in always-intact married families are also more likely to help their children do their homework than are parents in stepfamilies or single-parent families,3) and fathers in always-intact married families are more involved in their children’s homework than are stepfathers.4) Compared with children in stable married families, students experiencing parental divorce have lower academic expectations and test scores.5).
    - Evidence 3: Plenty of research indicates that healthy marriage positively impacts children and society. And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, it’s possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages..
    - Evidence 4: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 5: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization..
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church..
    - Evidence 3: Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually..
    - Evidence 4: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 5: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Even middle-aged people, who generally tend to be unhappier than people in other stages of life, according to Science Daily, were able to enjoy an elevated level of happiness if they were married. Marriage may help ease the causes of a mid-life dip in life satisfaction and the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived, Helliwell explained..
    - Evidence 2: It’s not marriage that makes you happy, it’s happy marriage that makes you happy, Gilbert said. Married people are happier than unmarried ones, perhaps because the single best predictor of human happiness is the quality of social relationships. Marriage seems to buy you a decade or more of happiness, Gilbert said..
    - Evidence 3: Other recent research, however, has challenged this pessimistic view. Data from a large British panel survey show that marriage increased long-run happiness, suggesting that selection isn’t the whole story. Perhaps marriage doesn’t make Germans happy, but it does seem to make the English happy. Likewise, a paper using panel data from Taiwan has found somewhat more durable positive effects of marriage (though this there was a lot of variety in happiness trajectories, and Christians might get more happiness from marriage than other people)..
    - Evidence 4: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 5: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly..
    - Evidence 2: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult.
    - Evidence 3: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 4: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
    - Evidence 5: Each decision you as a couple can successfully make together brings you closer to each other..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage..
    - Evidence 2: One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill..
    - Evidence 3: There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married..
    - Evidence 4: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 5: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..

- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization..
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church..
    - Evidence 3: Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually..
    - Evidence 4: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 5: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Even middle-aged people, who generally tend to be unhappier than people in other stages of life, according to Science Daily, were able to enjoy an elevated level of happiness if they were married. Marriage may help ease the causes of a mid-life dip in life satisfaction and the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived, Helliwell explained..
    - Evidence 2: It’s not marriage that makes you happy, it’s happy marriage that makes you happy, Gilbert said. Married people are happier than unmarried ones, perhaps because the single best predictor of human happiness is the quality of social relationships. Marriage seems to buy you a decade or more of happiness, Gilbert said..
    - Evidence 3: Other recent research, however, has challenged this pessimistic view. Data from a large British panel survey show that marriage increased long-run happiness, suggesting that selection isn’t the whole story. Perhaps marriage doesn’t make Germans happy, but it does seem to make the English happy. Likewise, a paper using panel data from Taiwan has found somewhat more durable positive effects of marriage (though this there was a lot of variety in happiness trajectories, and Christians might get more happiness from marriage than other people)..
    - Evidence 4: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 5: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly..
    - Evidence 2: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult.
    - Evidence 3: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 4: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
    - Evidence 5: Each decision you as a couple can successfully make together brings you closer to each other..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage..
    - Evidence 2: One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill..
    - Evidence 3: There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married..
    - Evidence 4: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 5: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..

Discriminatory social norms that link a girl’s perceived “purity” to her family’s honor are among the factors that push girls into marriage.

    - Evidence 1: Alison, for instance, found that her husband would go out with his friends at the weekend while she stayed at home, preparing lessons and doing the housework. Then there are factors that have the capacity to bring everything to a head. Money is one. “He’d say, ‘Well, you chose to have a low-paid job,’” Alison says. By then they’d had a (planned and wanted) baby, and children are another acknowledged marriage stressor. They bring high strain (in terms of finances, fatigue and housework) and often highlight different standards of care. “It wasn’t an easy time,” Alison says. “It reinforced just how different we were.

    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 3: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
    - Evidence 4: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..

- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..

    - Evidence 3: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..

","Sure, I can summarize the arguments for abandoning marriage.

Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women. In many societies, marriage is seen as a woman's duty, and she is expected to subordinate herself to her husband. This can lead to domestic violence, financial dependence, and a lack of control over her own life.
Marriages are unstable. The divorce rate in many countries is high, and this can have a devastating impact on children. Studies have shown that children of divorced parents are more likely to experience poverty, mental health problems, and behavioral problems.
Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations. In many countries, marriage comes with a number of legal obligations, such as the duty to support one's spouse financially and the right to make decisions about their partner's medical care. These obligations can be unfair, especially if one partner is more financially secure or has more power in the relationship.
Most of the advantages of marriage can be achieved by a monogamous relationship. Monogamous relationships can provide the same level of emotional intimacy, support, and stability as marriage, without the legal obligations and risks.
Of course, there are also many arguments in favor of marriage. For example, marriage can provide a stable and loving environment for raising children, and it can offer financial security and companionship. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to get married is a personal one.

Here are some additional points that could be made in the debate:

Marriage is not necessary for happiness. There are many happy people who are single or in non-marital relationships.
Marriage can be oppressive. Marriage can be a source of control and oppression, especially for women.
Marriage is not always a good choice. There are many reasons why someone might choose not to get married, such as a lack of interest, a history of abuse, or a desire for more freedom.
The debate over whether or not to abandon marriage is a complex one. There are many factors to consider, and ultimately the decision is a personal one.","Sure, I can summarize the arguments for abandoning marriage.

    - Evidence 2: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 3: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
    - Evidence 4: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: B.R. international Public School shows that alongside featuring unity, uniforms likewise promote equality. Envision the circumstance without school uniforms. Students would show up in garments of their decision. Regardless of the amount we attempt, this will ingrain inequality- kids from rich foundations would wear their marked garments and adornments, while other students would build up a feeling of inadequacy..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 3: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
    - Evidence 4: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result..
    - Evidence 3: One study showed that 70% of principals believed that mandated school uniforms reduced disciplinary problems at their schools..
    - Evidence 4: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
    - Evidence 5: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
    - Evidence 3: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..

    - Evidence 3: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
    - Evidence 4: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..

- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result..
    - Evidence 3: One study showed that 70% of principals believed that mandated school uniforms reduced disciplinary problems at their schools..
    - Evidence 4: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
    - Evidence 5: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
    - Evidence 3: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..

Arguments in favor of school uniforms

School uniforms can help to reduce bullying. When students are all wearing the same thing, it is less likely that they will be targeted for bullying based on their clothing choices.
School uniforms can help to create a sense of unity and equality among students. When everyone is dressed the same, it can help to break down social barriers and create a more inclusive environment.
School uniforms can help to save money for families. The cost of school uniforms is typically lower than the cost of buying new clothes every season.
School uniforms can help to promote a more professional and respectful environment in schools. When students are dressed in a uniform, it can help them to focus on their studies and take their education more seriously.
Arguments against school uniforms

School uniforms can stifle students' creativity and self-expression. When students are not allowed to choose their own clothes, it can make it more difficult for them to express themselves and their individuality.
School uniforms can be expensive for some families. Not all families can afford to buy the required uniforms, which can create an unfair advantage for students from wealthier families.
School uniforms can be uncomfortable for some students. Not all students find uniforms to be comfortable, and some may feel restricted or uncomfortable wearing them.
School uniforms can be difficult to enforce. It can be challenging for schools to ensure that all students are following the uniform policy, and this can lead to disciplinary problems.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to implement a school uniform policy is a complex one. There are both pros and cons to consider, and the best decision for a particular school will depend on a variety of factors, such as the school's demographics, culture, and budget.

It is important to note that the evidence in favor of school uniforms is not conclusive. Some studies have found that school uniforms can help to reduce bullying and promote a more positive school climate, while other studies have found no such effects.

","Should we abandon the use of school uniforms?

School uniforms have been a hotly debated topic for many years. Proponents of uniforms argue that they promote equality, reduce distractions, and improve safety. Opponents argue that they stifle individuality, are expensive, and are not effective in reducing bullying.

Arguments in favor of abolishing school uniforms:

School uniforms stifle individuality. Students should be able to express themselves through their clothing. Forcing them to wear uniforms takes away this important form of self-expression.
School uniforms are expensive. The cost of buying uniforms can be a burden for many families.
School uniforms are not effective in reducing bullying. Studies have shown that school uniforms do not have a significant impact on bullying rates.
Arguments in favor of keeping school uniforms:

School uniforms promote equality. Everyone looks the same, regardless of their social status or economic background. This can help to create a more cohesive school community.
School uniforms reduce distractions. Students are less likely to be distracted by their clothing if they are all wearing the same thing. This can lead to improved academic performance.
School uniforms improve safety. School uniforms can help to identify students and make it more difficult for them to bring weapons or drugs to school.
Conclusion:

There are valid arguments on both sides of the debate about school uniforms. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to require school uniforms is a decision that should be made by each individual school district.

Here are some additional thoughts on the matter:

It is important to consider the age of the students when making a decision about school uniforms. Elementary school students may benefit from wearing uniforms, as they are still developing their sense of identity and may be more easily influenced by peer pressure. However, older students may feel that uniforms are too restrictive and may resent being forced to wear them.
It is also important to consider the culture of the school when making a decision about school uniforms. Some schools have a strong sense of community and tradition, and uniforms may be seen as a way of reinforcing these values. However, other schools may have a more relaxed atmosphere, and uniforms may be seen as unnecessary or even oppressive.
The decision of whether or not to require school uniforms is a complex one. There is no easy answer, and the best decision for one school may not be the best decision for another.","**Should we abandon the use of school uniforms?**

    - Evidence 1: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
    - Evidence 2: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..

    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
    - Evidence 3: Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals..
    - Evidence 4: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 5: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..

    - Evidence 1: Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that he is against the death penalty, whether it is Saddam Hussein or anybody else..
    - Evidence 2: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as deliberate and systematic .. extrajudicial killings, and has condemned them as crimes against humanity..
    - Evidence 3: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..

- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bolte was a proponent of using capital punishment as a deterrent against violent crime..
    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
    - Evidence 3: Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals..
    - Evidence 4: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 5: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","The death penalty is a highly controversial topic, with strong arguments on both sides. Those who support the death penalty argue that it is a just punishment for certain crimes, such as murder, and that it deters others from committing similar crimes. They also argue that it brings closure to the families of victims. Those who oppose the death penalty argue that it is cruel and unusual punishment, that it is not an effective deterrent, and that there is always the risk of executing an innocent person.

Here is a summary of the arguments for and against the death penalty, based on the evidence presented in the prompt:

Arguments in favor of the death penalty:

The death penalty is a just punishment for certain crimes, such as murder.
The death penalty deters others from committing similar crimes.
The death penalty brings closure to the families of victims.
Arguments against the death penalty:

The death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.
The death penalty is not an effective deterrent.
There is always the risk of executing an innocent person.
It is important to note that the evidence on the effectiveness of the death penalty is mixed. Some studies have found that it does deter crime, while others have found that it does not. There is also the risk of executing an innocent person, which is a serious moral concern.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to support the death penalty is a personal one. There are strong arguments on both sides, and each individual must weigh the evidence and decide what they believe is the right thing to do.

Here are some additional thoughts on the death penalty:

The death penalty is a complex issue with no easy answers.
There are many factors to consider, such as the cost of the death penalty, the risk of executing an innocent person, and the effectiveness of the death penalty as a deterrent.
It is important to have a thoughtful and informed discussion about the death penalty so that we can make the best decision for our society.","The death penalty is a highly controversial topic, with strong arguments on both sides.

Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent.

Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates.

Whether one compares the similar movements of homicide in Canada and the US when only the latter restored the death penalty, or in American states that have abolished it versus those that retain it, or in Hong Kong and Singapore (the first abolishing the death penalty in the mid-1990s and the second greatly increasing its usage at the same), there is no detectable effect of capital punishment on crime. The best econometric studies reach the same conclusion… Last year roughly 14,000 murders were committed but only 35 executions took place. Since murderers typically expose themselves to far greater immediate risks, the likelihood is incredibly remote that some small chance of execution many years after committing a crime will influence the behaviour of a sociopathic deviant who would otherwise be willing to kill if his only penalty were life imprisonment. Any criminal who actually thought he would be caught would find the prospect of life without parole to be a monumental penalty.

","Sure, here is a summary of the arguments against the death penalty:

The death penalty is a form of state-sanctioned killing, which is morally wrong.
The death penalty is applied in an unfair and unjust manner, with people of color and the poor being more likely to be sentenced to death.
The death penalty is irreversible, and there have been many cases where innocent people have been executed.
The death penalty does not deter crime, and there is no evidence that it makes society safer.
The death penalty is expensive, and the money could be better spent on other programs, such as education or healthcare.
In addition to these arguments, there are also religious and philosophical arguments against the death penalty. Some religions, such as Christianity and Islam, teach that all human life is sacred and should be protected. Others, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, believe that all life is interconnected and that killing another person is harmful to oneself and to the entire universe.

The death penalty is a complex issue with no easy answers. However, the arguments against it are strong and persuasive. It is time for the United States to abolish this cruel and unnecessary punishment.

Here are some additional details on the evidence supporting the arguments against the death penalty:

The death penalty is a form of state-sanctioned killing, which is morally wrong. Many people believe that it is wrong for the government to take a human life, even in the case of someone who has committed a terrible crime. This is because the death penalty is irreversible, and there is always the risk that an innocent person could be executed.
The death penalty is applied in an unfair and unjust manner. Studies have shown that people of color and the poor are more likely to be sentenced to death than white people. This is because they are more likely to be poor and have less access to good lawyers.
The death penalty is irreversible. There have been many cases where innocent people have been executed. In fact, since 1973, over 160 people have been exonerated from death row in the United States. This means that they were falsely convicted and sentenced to death.
The death penalty does not deter crime. Studies have shown that the death penalty does not deter crime any more effectively than other punishments, such as life in prison without parole.
The death penalty is expensive. The cost of executing someone is much higher than the cost of imprisoning them for life. This is because of the lengthy appeals process that is required in death penalty cases.
In conclusion, the arguments against the death penalty are strong and persuasive. It is time for the United States to abolish this cruel and unnecessary punishment.","Sure, here is a summary of the arguments against the death penalty:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By codifying intellectual property for plant breeders, UPOV aims to encourage the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society..
    - Evidence 2: Some copyright scholars believe that, regardless of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created..
    - Evidence 3: The basic public policy rationale for the protection of intellectual property is that IP laws facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovation into the public domain for the common good, by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights to exploit their works and invention for a limited period..
    - Evidence 4: Relying on the concept of the author, copyright is based on the assumption that without an intellectual property rights regime, authors would have no incentive to further create, and that artists cannot produce new works without an economic incentive..
    - Evidence 5: Examples of such theories include incentives theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivising the creation of new creative works..
- claim_2: Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) states that effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally..
    - Evidence 2: According to the review intellectual property (IP) policy is an increasingly important tool for stimulating economic growth..
    - Evidence 3: Many economists believe that, in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced, because there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organisations to produce them.
    - Evidence 4: In relation to computer software, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) claimed in its 2011 piracy study: Public opinion continues to support intellectual property (IP) rights: Seven PC users in 10 support paying innovators to promote more technological advances...
    - Evidence 5: A joint research project of the WIPO and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth..
- claim_3: Intellectual property rights protect against stealing.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Annexed to this is the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) which aims to 'reduce distortions .. in international trade .. promote effective and adequate protection of intellectual property rights .. '..
    - Evidence 2: Operation In Our Sites is an initiative led by the NIPRCC to detect and hinder intellectual property violations on the Internet..
    - Evidence 3: If we want to continue to lead the world in producing intellectual property, we need to protect Americans' rights in that property, stated Senator Leahy..
    - Evidence 4: Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create..
    - Evidence 5: Proponents say that copyright better preserves intellectual property like movies, music and television shows..
- claim_4: People, or a business, own their innovations and should be able to be compensated for their endeavour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intellectual property rights (IPRs) - IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation)..
    - Evidence 2: By providing innovators with durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources, intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility..
    - Evidence 3: A great number of jobs and industries are dependent on intellectual property and many people could benefit from better control and enforcement of their IP rights..
    - Evidence 4: IP-intensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added (price minus material cost) per employee than non-IP-intensive industries.
    - Evidence 5: These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs..

    - Evidence 1: By codifying intellectual property for plant breeders, UPOV aims to encourage the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society..
    - Evidence 2: Some copyright scholars believe that, regardless of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created..
    - Evidence 3: The basic public policy rationale for the protection of intellectual property is that IP laws facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovation into the public domain for the common good, by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights to exploit their works and invention for a limited period..
    - Evidence 4: Relying on the concept of the author, copyright is based on the assumption that without an intellectual property rights regime, authors would have no incentive to further create, and that artists cannot produce new works without an economic incentive..
    - Evidence 5: Examples of such theories include incentives theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivising the creation of new creative works..
- claim_2: Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) states that effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally..
    - Evidence 2: According to the review intellectual property (IP) policy is an increasingly important tool for stimulating economic growth..
    - Evidence 3: Many economists believe that, in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced, because there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organisations to produce them.
    - Evidence 4: In relation to computer software, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) claimed in its 2011 piracy study: Public opinion continues to support intellectual property (IP) rights: Seven PC users in 10 support paying innovators to promote more technological advances...
    - Evidence 5: A joint research project of the WIPO and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth..
- claim_3: Intellectual property rights protect against stealing.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Annexed to this is the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) which aims to 'reduce distortions .. in international trade .. promote effective and adequate protection of intellectual property rights .. '..
    - Evidence 2: Operation In Our Sites is an initiative led by the NIPRCC to detect and hinder intellectual property violations on the Internet..
    - Evidence 3: If we want to continue to lead the world in producing intellectual property, we need to protect Americans' rights in that property, stated Senator Leahy..
    - Evidence 4: Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create..
    - Evidence 5: Proponents say that copyright better preserves intellectual property like movies, music and television shows..
- claim_4: People, or a business, own their innovations and should be able to be compensated for their endeavour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intellectual property rights (IPRs) - IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation)..
    - Evidence 2: By providing innovators with durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources, intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility..
    - Evidence 3: A great number of jobs and industries are dependent on intellectual property and many people could benefit from better control and enforcement of their IP rights..
    - Evidence 4: IP-intensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added (price minus material cost) per employee than non-IP-intensive industries.
    - Evidence 5: These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs..
","Sure, here is a summary of the arguments in favor of intellectual property rights:

Intellectual property rights incentivize creativity and innovation. Without the ability to profit from their creations, people would be less likely to invest the time and effort necessary to come up with new ideas. This is especially true for large-scale projects that require significant investment, such as developing new drugs or creating new software.
Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products. When businesses know that they can protect their intellectual property, they are more likely to invest in research and development. This leads to the development of new products and services that benefit consumers and society as a whole.
Intellectual property rights protect against stealing. When people steal intellectual property, they are essentially taking something that does not belong to them. This can have a devastating impact on the creators of intellectual property, who may lose out on profits and even be forced to go out of business.
People, or a business, own their innovations and should be able to be compensated for their endeavor. Intellectual property is the product of human creativity and ingenuity. As such, it is only fair that the people who create it should be able to benefit from it. This is especially important in today's economy, where knowledge and information are increasingly valuable assets.
Of course, there are also arguments against intellectual property rights. Some people argue that they stifle innovation by giving too much power to large corporations. Others argue that they are unfair to consumers, who may have to pay higher prices for products that are protected by intellectual property rights.

Ultimately, the debate over intellectual property rights is a complex one. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. However, the evidence suggests that intellectual property rights do play an important role in encouraging innovation and economic growth.","Sure, here is a summary of the arguments in favor of intellectual property rights:

","The debate on whether or not to abolish intellectual property rights is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.

Arguments in favor of abolishing intellectual property rights

Intellectual property rights can stifle innovation. When companies have a monopoly on their ideas, they have less incentive to improve them. This can lead to stagnation in the market and fewer new products and services being developed.
Intellectual property rights can restrict access to important information and products. For example, pharmaceutical companies often use patents to keep the prices of life-saving drugs high, making them unaffordable for many people.
Intellectual property rights can be unfair. They often benefit large corporations at the expense of small businesses and individuals.
Intellectual property rights can be expensive to enforce. This can be a burden for businesses, especially small businesses, and can lead to higher prices for consumers.
Arguments against abolishing intellectual property rights

Intellectual property rights can encourage innovation. When companies have a limited monopoly on their ideas, they have an incentive to develop them in order to make a profit. This can lead to new products and services being created, which can benefit consumers.
Intellectual property rights can protect consumers. For example, patents can ensure that consumers have access to safe and effective drugs.
Intellectual property rights can promote competition. When companies have to compete for customers, they are more likely to innovate and offer better products and services at lower prices.
Intellectual property rights can be a source of revenue for governments. This revenue can be used to fund important public services, such as education and healthcare.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to abolish intellectual property rights is a complex one with no easy answers. There are strong arguments on both sides of the debate, and the best solution may vary depending on the specific circumstances.

In my opinion, intellectual property rights can be a valuable tool for promoting innovation and protecting consumers. However, I also believe that these rights should be balanced with the need to ensure that everyone has access to important information and products. I think that a more balanced approach to intellectual property rights would be to shorten the duration of patents and copyrights, and to make it easier for people to use copyrighted material for educational and non-commercial purposes.","The debate on whether or not to abolish intellectual property rights is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.

A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, a study was released that examined the effect of comprehensive background checks on the state. The study examined nearly two decades (1981-2000) of data and found that background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California..
    - Evidence 3: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
    - Evidence 4: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates..

    - Evidence 1: In 2010, the Court further strengthened Second Amendment protections in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 567 F.3d 856. The plaintiff in McDonald challenged the constitutionality of the Chicago handgun ban, which prohibited handgun possession by almost all private citizens. In a 5-4 decision, the Court, citing the intentions of the framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment, held that the Second Amendment applies to the states through the incorporation doctrine..
    - Evidence 2: In 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court struck down a New York law requiring parties interested in purchasing a handgun for the use of self-defense outside of the home to obtain a license because the law issued licenses on a “may-issue” rather than a “shall issue” basis. This “may issue” licensing method allowed state authorities to deny interested parties public use licenses for firearms if the interested party was unable to show “proper cause” as to why they have a heightened need for self-protection over the general population..
    - Evidence 3: In a 5-4 vote Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of individual Americans to keep and bear arms. The court said gun ownership is an individual right, not connected with military service, and that it can be regulated in some ways..
    - Evidence 4: The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision. 'Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,' he said..
    - Evidence 5: For today’s gun owners, the right to own guns nearly rivals other rights laid out in the U.S. Constitution in terms of its personal salience. About three-quarters of gun owners (74%) say this right is essential to their own sense of freedom..

    - Evidence 2: Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, stated, 'The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.'.
    - Evidence 3: A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun..
    - Evidence 4: Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer..

    - Evidence 1: According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment..
    - Evidence 3: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama’s: 'every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.'.
    - Evidence 2: Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, stated, 'The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.'.
    - Evidence 3: A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun..
    - Evidence 4: Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer..
    - Evidence 5: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
","The debate over the right to keep and bear arms is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.

Opponents of gun rights argue that gun control is ineffective and that gun ownership is a right that should be abolished. They point to studies that show that gun control laws have little effect on crime rates, and they argue that the Second Amendment does not guarantee an individual right to own guns.

Proponents of gun rights argue that gun control is necessary to reduce gun violence, and that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns for self-defense, hunting, and other purposes. They point to studies that show that gun control laws can reduce gun violence, and they argue that the Second Amendment is a fundamental right that should not be infringed upon.

The following are some of the arguments and evidence that have been put forward by both sides of the debate:

Opponents of gun rights argue that:

Gun control is ineffective. A 2016 study by the RAND Corporation found that ""there is no clear evidence that gun control laws have a significant effect on reducing violent crime.""
Gun ownership is a right that should be abolished. The Second Amendment was written at a time when the United States was a very different country, and it does not apply to the modern world.
Proponents of gun rights argue that:

Gun control is necessary to reduce gun violence. A 2017 study by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center found that ""universal background checks are associated with a 15% reduction in firearm homicides.""
The Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to own guns. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own guns for self-defense.
The debate over gun rights is likely to continue for many years to come. There are strong arguments on both sides of the issue, and it is a complex one that cannot be easily resolved.

In the meantime, it is important to have a respectful and civil discussion about the issue. We should listen to each other's arguments and try to understand each other's perspectives. Only then can we hope to find a solution that works for everyone.","**The debate over the right to keep and bear arms is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.**

","The following is a summary of the arguments in favor of abolishing the right to keep and bear arms:

Banning guns would save lives. Studies have shown that states with higher rates of gun ownership have higher rates of homicide, assault, and suicide. For example, a study by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center found that states with the highest rates of gun ownership had homicide rates that were 25% higher than states with the lowest rates of gun ownership.
Gun ownership allows for mass shootings and other forms of gun violence. Mass shootings are becoming increasingly common in the United States, and many of these shootings have been carried out by people who legally purchased their guns. For example, the gunman who killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, had a domestic violence conviction, which should have prevented him from buying a gun.
Guns can fall into the wrong hands. Guns are often stolen or sold illegally, and these guns can then be used to commit crimes. For example, a Secret Service analysis found that of 24 mass shootings in 2019, at least 10 (42%) involved illegally possessed guns.
Guns lead to accidental deaths. Guns are often stored in homes where children can access them, and these children can accidentally shoot themselves or others. For example, in 2021, there were over 2,000 unintentional shooting deaths in the United States.
The arguments in favor of abolishing the right to keep and bear arms are strong. Guns are a major public health problem in the United States, and they are responsible for thousands of deaths and injuries each year. Banning guns would save lives and make our communities safer.","The following is a summary of the arguments in favor of abolishing the right to keep and bear arms:

"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are warning signs that acute budget and service pressures can encourage a retreat to silos or ‘passing the buck’, particularly at the operational level..
    - Evidence 2: The UK’s largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has documented a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. In that decade this food bank network went from distributing just under 26,000 parcels a year to handing out more than 1.33 million of them..
    - Evidence 3: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
    - Evidence 4: “Taking care of ‘at risk’ children is a mandatory concern. However, youth centres and outreach services are considered unessential and have been cut to the bone. Yet these are services that help prevent children becoming ‘at risk’ in the first place,” said Gray..
    - Evidence 5: “For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
    - Evidence 3: For instance, interest rates on Greek debt fell following its first bailout. However, the gains were limited to the government having decreased interest rate expenses. Although the private sector was unable to benefit, the major beneficiaries of lower rates are large corporations. Consumers benefited only marginally from lower rates, but the lack of sustainable economic growth kept borrowing at depressed levels despite the lower rates..
    - Evidence 4: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
    - Evidence 5: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government should listen to the people being pushed into poverty by its policies. Universal credit is failing miserably, leaving families in debt, [in] rent arrears and at risk of becoming homeless. Three million children are growing up in poverty despite living in a working household..
    - Evidence 2: Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots – Denise Hunter, 57, at the West End food bank in Newcastle-on-Tyne.
    - Evidence 3: I got hungry because I was smelling the other food. I had to take my eyes away from it. The most unfair thing is the government knows families are going through hard times but they decide not to do anything about it – John Adebola-Samuel, 12, whose family couldn’t get school meals in Dumfries, Scotland, because of their immigration status.
    - Evidence 4: I was 18 [and homeless] and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work. I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing – Tayah, west London..
    - Evidence 5: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
    - Evidence 3: Because the evidence shows that austerity strangled the green shoots of economic recovery that were sprouting when the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition took office..
    - Evidence 4: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
    - Evidence 5: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers..
    - Evidence 2: Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%..
    - Evidence 3: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
    - Evidence 4: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
    - Evidence 5: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..

    - Evidence 1: Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers..
    - Evidence 2: Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%..
    - Evidence 3: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
    - Evidence 4: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
    - Evidence 5: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","Sure, I can summarize the arguments against austerity.

Austerity cuts access to essential services. Austerity measures often lead to cuts in public services, such as healthcare, education, and social welfare. This can have a negative impact on the most vulnerable members of society, such as children, the elderly, and the sick.
Austerity extends recessions. When governments cut spending, it can lead to a decrease in economic activity. This can lead to a vicious cycle, where the government cuts spending to reduce the deficit, which leads to a recession, which leads to lower tax revenue, which forces the government to cut spending even more.
Austerity is unfair to the citizens. Austerity measures often fall disproportionately on the poor and the middle class. This is because these groups are more likely to rely on government services and are less likely to be able to afford to pay higher taxes.
Austerity results in lower growth. Austerity measures can lead to a decrease in economic growth. This is because they can lead to a decrease in investment, consumption, and government spending.
Austerity results in lower job creation. Austerity measures can lead to a decrease in job creation. This is because they can lead to a decrease in investment, consumption, and government spending.
There is a growing body of evidence that suggests that austerity measures are not effective in reducing government debt or deficits. In fact, they can often have the opposite effect, by leading to a decrease in economic growth and an increase in unemployment.

There are a number of alternative approaches to reducing government debt and deficits that do not have the same negative consequences as austerity. These include:

Increased tax revenue. This can be done by closing tax loopholes, raising taxes on the wealthy, or increasing the overall tax rate.
Reduced government spending. This can be done by cutting unnecessary spending, such as on military contracts and corporate subsidies.
Economic growth. This can be stimulated by investing in infrastructure, education, and research and development.
It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of government debt and deficits. The best approach will vary depending on the specific circumstances of each country. However, the evidence suggests that austerity is not an effective solution and that there are a number of other options that are more likely to be successful.","Sure, I can summarize the arguments against austerity.

"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 2: If budget deficits are not cut, it can lead to higher bond yields (e.g. in case of Greece, Spain and Ireland)..
    - Evidence 3: After 2009 recession, many European and US economies faced record levels of peace-time deficit. The UK budget deficit was over 10% of GDP, causing a rise in national debt..
    - Evidence 4: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
    - Evidence 5: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: If policymakers and the electorate show sufficient resolve, carrying through with austerity will eventually be rewarded by better financing conditions. Austerity pays off in the long run..
    - Evidence 4: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Astute monetary policy and falls in international commodity prices are given by a recent World Bank overview, as reasons for this relatively steady growth in the services and industrial sectors, enjoyed by Morocco and reflected in the country’s GDP..
    - Evidence 2: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 3: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
    - Evidence 4: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..

- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Almost a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis, national debt in advanced economies remains near its highest level since World War II, averaging 104 percent of GDP. In Japan, the ratio is 240 percent and in Greece almost 185 percent. In Italy and Portugal, debt exceeds 120 percent of GDP. Without measures either to cut spending or increase revenue, the situation will only get worse..
    - Evidence 2: The most commonly proposed austerity measures in the IMF loans include wage bill cuts and freezes (31 countries), increases to or the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) (14 countries), and general public expenditure cuts (55 countries)..
    - Evidence 3: David Cameron used his speech at the Scottish Conservative conference over the weekend to hit back. He said: 'Our opponents bleat on about austerity but I tell you – if we don’t get a grip of these debts, they will grip us.'.
    - Evidence 4: The budget deficit was 11% of GDP in 2009-10. It is now about 5.5% and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of UK predicts a surplus by the end of the decade..
    - Evidence 5: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Despite its negative reputation concerning its commitment to reforms and its implementation record, Greece has put forth an immense effort over the last three years and indeed has taken impressive steps toward achieving fiscal sustainability, with occasionally remarkable results. In the three years since the beginning of the crisis, it implemented a fiscal tightening of some 20% of GDP (around €50bn, while it has committed to measures cumulatively totalling €65bn by 2015) and reduced its budget deficit by an impressive nine percentage points, despite having lost a fifth of its GDP since 2009..
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.

","The debate on whether or not atheism should be adopted is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.

Opponents of atheism argue that it is discriminatory and violates freedom of religion. They point to historical examples of atheism being used to justify persecution and discrimination against religious people, such as the Soviet Union's anti-religious campaigns. They also argue that atheism undermines morality, as it removes the belief in a higher power that can reward good behavior and punish bad behavior.

Proponents of atheism argue that it is a valid and rational choice, and that people should be free to choose their own beliefs. They point out that there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of God, and that atheism is simply the lack of belief in God. They also argue that atheism can be a source of morality, as it can lead people to live their lives based on reason and compassion rather than fear of punishment.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to adopt atheism is a personal one. There are strong arguments on both sides, and each individual must weigh the evidence and decide what they believe.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the arguments on both sides:

Arguments against atheism

Atheism discriminates against religious people.
Atheism has been used to justify persecution and discrimination against religious people throughout history. For example, the Soviet Union's anti-religious campaigns resulted in the imprisonment, torture, and execution of millions of religious people.
Atheism can lead to a lack of morality.
Without the belief in a higher power, people may be less motivated to behave morally. For example, they may be more likely to cheat, steal, or harm others without fear of punishment.
Atheism can also lead to a sense of alienation and isolation.
Without a shared belief in God, people may feel less connected to their community and society. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, despair, and hopelessness.
Arguments for atheism

Atheism is a valid and rational choice.
There is no scientific evidence to support the existence of God.
The burden of proof lies with the person making the claim, and there is no evidence that can definitively prove the existence of God.
The universe can be explained without the need for a creator.
Atheism is simply the lack of belief in God.
It is not a belief system in itself, but rather a rejection of the belief in God.
People should be free to choose their own beliefs.
Atheism is a personal choice, and each individual should be free to decide what they believe.
Forcing people to believe in something they do not believe is a violation of their freedom of religion.
In conclusion, the debate on whether or not to adopt atheism is a complex one. There are strong arguments on both sides, and each individual must weigh the evidence and decide what they believe.","The debate on whether or not atheism should be adopted is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.

They also argue that atheism can be a source of morality, as it can lead people to live their lives based on reason and compassion rather than fear of punishment.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to adopt atheism is a personal one. There are strong arguments on both sides, and each individual must weigh the evidence and decide what they believe.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the arguments on both sides:

**Arguments against atheism**

* Atheism discriminates against religious people.
    * Atheism has been used to justify persecution and discrimination against religious people throughout history. For example, the Soviet Union's anti-religious campaigns resulted in the imprisonment, torture, and execution of millions of religious people.
    * Atheism can lead to a lack of morality.
        * Without the belief in a higher power, people may be less motivated to behave morally. For example, they may be more likely to cheat, steal, or harm others without fear of punishment.
        * Atheism can also lead to a sense of alienation and isolation.
            * Without a shared belief in God, people may feel less connected to their community and society. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, despair, and hopelessness.

**Arguments for atheism**

* Atheism is a valid and rational choice.
    * There is no scientific evidence to support the existence of God.
        * The burden of proof lies with the person making the claim, and there is no evidence that can definitively prove the existence of God.
        * The universe can be explained without the need for a creator.
    * Atheism is simply the lack of belief in God.
        * It is not a belief system in itself, but rather a rejection of the belief in God.
* People should be free to choose their own beliefs.
    * Atheism is a personal choice, and each individual should be free to decide what they believe.
    * Forcing people to believe in something they do not believe is a violation of their freedom of religion.

In conclusion, the debate on whether or not to adopt atheism is a complex one. There are strong arguments on both sides, and each individual must weigh the evidence and decide what they believe."
"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: Being an atheists often comes with contradictory ideologies that the society thrusts upon people but on the inside, atheists are free of conflicting ideas. They do not need to debate almost every time some stranger comments or offends any religion for they not believe in religion. They do not ever get into heated debates about which religion is better than the other..
    - Evidence 3: They believe in scientific explanations and do not dwell on mythologies that are most of the time impossible to believe in unless you are a blind follower. Their reasons and concepts are clear and they are happy about whatever they believe to be true. Satisfaction at heart is the most important thing people seek and atheism brings it in the most literary and non-mythical way..
    - Evidence 4: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
    - Evidence 5: I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A few years ago, in a conversation with fellow atheist Peter Boghossian, Richard Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
    - Evidence 3: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 4: Theodore Drange (2006)  has developed an argument that if God were the sort of being that wanted humans to come to believe that he exists, then he could bring it about that far more of them would believe than currently do.  God would be able, he would want humans to believe, there is nothing that he would want more, and God would not be irrational.  So God would bring it about that people would believe.  In general, he could have brought it about that the evidence that people have is far more convincing than what they have.  He could have miraculously appeared to everyone in a fashion that was far more compelling than the miracles stories that we have.  It is not the case that all, nearly all, or even a majority of people believe, so there must not be a God of that sort..
    - Evidence 5: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
    - Evidence 3: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
    - Evidence 4: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.

    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
    - Evidence 3: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).

"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 2: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
    - Evidence 3: The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others..
    - Evidence 4: Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered..
    - Evidence 5: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
    - Evidence 3: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good..
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
    - Evidence 3: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
    - Evidence 3: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..

- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good..
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
    - Evidence 3: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

","Sure, I can summarize the arguments against libertarianism.

Claim 1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
Libertarians believe that the free market is the best way to promote economic growth. They argue that government intervention in the economy, such as regulations and taxes, stifles innovation and investment. However, critics of libertarianism argue that market failures, such as monopolies and externalities, can lead to economic instability and inequality. They also argue that government intervention can be used to promote economic growth, such as by investing in infrastructure and education.

Claim 2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
Libertarians believe that people should be free to make their own choices, regardless of their race, gender, or social class. They argue that government programs that attempt to help minorities and the poor often do more harm than good. However, critics of libertarianism argue that these programs are essential to ensuring that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. They also argue that libertarianism can lead to increased inequality, as the wealthy are able to take advantage of their freedom to accumulate more wealth.

Claim 3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
Libertarians believe that everyone has an equal right to freedom. They argue that government should not interfere with people's lives, even if they make choices that are harmful to themselves or others. However, critics of libertarianism argue that this view of freedom is too simplistic. They argue that people's freedom is often limited by factors such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of education. They also argue that government intervention is sometimes necessary to protect people's rights.

Claim 4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
Libertarians believe that the government should only provide essential services, such as national defense and law enforcement. They argue that the private sector can provide most other services more efficiently and effectively. However, critics of libertarianism argue that the government plays an essential role in providing many services, such as education, healthcare, and social welfare. They argue that these services are necessary to ensure that everyone has a decent standard of living.

Claim 5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
Libertarians believe that individuals are best able to protect their own rights. They argue that government intervention in the protection of rights is often unnecessary and counterproductive. However, critics of libertarianism argue that the government is essential to protecting the rights of citizens. They argue that the government is the only entity that has the power to enforce laws and protect people from harm.

","Proponents of libertarianism argue that it would increase economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfillment, and individual freedom/liberties.

Economic growth. Libertarians believe that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals, which in turn leads to increased economic growth. They argue that when individuals are free to make their own decisions about how to use their resources, they are more likely to invest in productive activities that will lead to economic growth. Additionally, libertarians argue that competition between businesses is essential for innovation and economic growth. When businesses are free to compete, they are more likely to develop new products and services that meet the needs of consumers.
Freedom in the political system. Libertarians believe that the central goal of political systems should be to protect individual liberty. They argue that this can be achieved by limiting the role of government in society and by protecting individual rights, such as the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to private property.
Happiness/fulfillment. Libertarians believe that individuals are happier when they are free to make their own choices about how to live their lives. They argue that when individuals are free to pursue their own interests and goals, they are more likely to find happiness and fulfillment. Additionally, libertarians argue that competition between businesses can lead to lower prices and better products, which can also contribute to happiness and fulfillment.
Individual freedom/liberties. Libertarians believe that individuals should have maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters. They argue that this includes the right to free speech, the right to bear arms, the right to private property, the right to travel freely, and the right to associate with whomever they choose.
Opponents of libertarianism argue that it would lead to decreased social welfare, increased inequality, and a decrease in environmental protection.

Decreased social welfare. Opponents of libertarianism argue that it would lead to decreased social welfare programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. They argue that these programs are essential for providing for the basic needs of the poor and elderly, and that their elimination would lead to increased poverty and hardship.
Increased inequality. Opponents of libertarianism argue that it would lead to increased inequality. They argue that when the government does not play a role in redistributing wealth, the wealthy will tend to accumulate more and more wealth, while the poor will become poorer.
Decrease in environmental protection. Opponents of libertarianism argue that it would lead to a decrease in environmental protection. They argue that the government has a responsibility to protect the environment, and that this responsibility would be diminished if the government's role in society was decreased.

","You are an expert debater. Follow the argumentative structure of the debate script to summarize the given debate material presented below. The debate material consists of a topic; a stance; a series of arguments and evidence to support that argument. You do not need to use all of the evidence, just select the most appropriate one or more that are well-argued and well-persuaded. You may add background information as appropriate. The material for the debate as follow: 

 Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
    - Evidence 3: Cloning can also be used to improve the quality of life for people with certain medical conditions. For example, cloning can be used to create replacement tissues for people with conditions like Parkinson's disease, which can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. A study by the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that transplantation of human stem cells can help to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease..
    - Evidence 4: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. By creating human cells and tissues that are specific to an individual, researchers can better understand the effects of new treatments and drugs on human health. For example, a study by the National Institutes of Health found that human tissue cloning can help to reduce the need for animal testing..
    - Evidence 5: Cloning can also be used to advance medical research in a number of different areas. For example, cloning can be used to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments for those diseases. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents claim that human reproductive cloning also would produce benefits.
    - Evidence 2: One of the main arguments for not banning human cloning is that cloning can help those who are struggling with infertility. According to the World Health Organization, infertility affects about 10% of couples of reproductive age worldwide..
    - Evidence 3: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility..
    - Evidence 4: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility.
    - Evidence 5: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is free of genetic diseases that are present in one of the parents. A study by the New England Journal of Medicine found that cloning can help to reduce the transmission of genetic diseases..
- claim_3: Cloning promotes health.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For example, scientists could clone specific organs and use them to replace damaged or diseased organs in individuals. A study by the Lancet medical journal found that cloning could provide a source of organs for those in need of transplants..
    - Evidence 2: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic makeup of individuals with a particular disease and to develop therapies that target the underlying cause of the disease. A study by the Nature Genetics journal found that cloning could be used to develop gene therapies for a range of diseases..
    - Evidence 3: For example, scientists could use cloning to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases. A study by the Nature journal found that cloning could greatly advance stem cell research..
    - Evidence 4: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of aging and to develop new therapies to slow or reverse the aging process. A study by the Aging Cell journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the process of aging..
    - Evidence 5: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of infertility and to develop new therapies to treat infertility. A study by the Fertility and Sterility journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the processes of reproduction..
- claim_4: Cloning promotes science/research.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, cloning can be used to study the development of embryos and to better understand the processes that occur during development. A study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help to advance medical science..
    - Evidence 2: For example, cloning can be used to study the development of embryos and to better understand the processes that occur during development. A study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that cloning can help to improve biomedical research..
    - Evidence 3: For example, cloning can be used to study the genetic makeup of individuals with a particular disease and to develop new therapies to treat the disease. A study by the Journal of Medical Science found that cloning can help to develop new therapies for a range of diseases..
    - Evidence 4: For example, cloning can be used to produce genetically modified organisms that can be used for a range of applications, such as producing new medicines and improving agricultural production. A study by the Nature Biotechnology journal found that cloning can help to advance biotechnology..
    - Evidence 5: For example, cloning can be used to study the genetic makeup of extinct species and to better understand the processes that led to their extinction. A study by the Journal of Evolutionary Biology found that cloning can help to better understand the process of evolution..
","The opponents of banning human cloning argue that it has a number of potential benefits, including:

Organ replication: Cloning can be used to create organs that are genetically identical to the recipient. This could help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation.
Helping those who can't otherwise have a child: Cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. This could be a valuable option for couples who are struggling with infertility.
Promoting health: Cloning could be used to study the genetic makeup of individuals with a particular disease and to develop therapies that target the underlying cause of the disease. It could also be used to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases.
Promoting science/research: Cloning can be used to study the development of embryos and to better understand the processes that occur during development. It can also be used to study the genetic makeup of individuals with a particular disease and to develop new therapies to treat the disease.
However, there are also a number of ethical concerns about human cloning, including:

The potential for abuse: Cloning could be used to create ""designer babies"" who are selected for their physical or intellectual characteristics. This could lead to a society where people are judged on their genetic makeup rather than their individual merits.
The risk of harm to the cloned child: Cloning is a relatively new technology and there is a risk that it could lead to health problems in the cloned child. For example, cloned animals have been known to have a higher risk of birth defects and health problems.
The moral status of the cloned child: Some people believe that cloned children are not fully human and that they should not be given the same rights as other children.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to ban human cloning is a complex one. There are a number of potential benefits and risks to consider, and it is important to weigh these carefully before making a decision.","The opponents of banning human cloning argue that it has a number of potential benefits, including:

"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
    - Evidence 3: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On December 13, 2001, the United Nations General Assembly began elaborating an international convention against the reproductive cloning of humans. A broad coalition of States, including Spain, Italy, the Philippines, the United States, Costa Rica and the Holy See sought to extend the debate to ban all forms of human cloning, noting that, in their view, therapeutic human cloning violates human dignity..
    - Evidence 2: The Ministry of Health enacted the Danish Council Act 1988, which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos..
    - Evidence 3: Article 11 of UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights asserts that the reproductive cloning of human beings is contrary to human dignity..
    - Evidence 4: Hwang himself criticised the process, stating that it did not bring science any closer to human cloning and the complexities, coupled with the low success rate (one in 123), did not make it ethical to clone family pets..
    - Evidence 5: In 2001, when Germany and France proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an international convention to ban reproductive human cloning, the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included Spain, Philippines, the United States, and Costa Rica, noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Much of the concern related to human cloning stems from a fear of overstepping the bounds of the natural order..
    - Evidence 2: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
    - Evidence 3: The Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and saw the alleged clone baby as an aberration..
    - Evidence 4: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child..
    - Evidence 2: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the journal Nature Biotechnology in 2005 found that cloning can result in genetic mutations that may cause long-term health problems and reduced lifespan..
    - Evidence 4: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2008 reported that cloning may result in unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences for the health of the cloned organism..
    - Evidence 5: A report published by the Council of Europe in 2008 discussed the potential for abuse of cloning technology and recommended measures to ensure that cloning is used for medical purposes only..

","Sure, here is a summary of the arguments for banning human cloning:

Cloning is not understood enough yet. We do not fully understand the risks and potential consequences of cloning, both for the cloned individual and for society as a whole. For example, there is a risk of genetic defects, premature death, and other health problems in cloned individuals. There is also the potential for cloning to be used for unethical purposes, such as creating clones for organ harvesting or creating designer babies.
Cloning is unethical/anti-religious. Many people believe that cloning is unethical because it violates the sanctity of human life. They argue that cloning creates a new individual who is not a product of love and procreation, but rather of science and technology. Some religious groups also oppose cloning on the grounds that it is a form of playing God.
Cloning is unnatural. Some people believe that cloning is unnatural and that it should not be done because it goes against the natural order of things. They argue that cloning is a form of genetic engineering that could have unintended consequences for the future of humanity.
Cloning is unsafe. There is a high risk of complications and health problems associated with cloning. For example, cloned animals are more likely to die at a young age or to have birth defects. There is also the potential for cloned humans to develop health problems later in life.
Based on these arguments, many countries have banned human cloning. However, there is still some debate about the ethics of cloning, and it is likely that this debate will continue for many years to come.

Here are some additional points that could be made in support of banning human cloning:

Cloning could lead to the exploitation of women and children. For example, women could be pressured to donate their eggs for cloning, and children could be cloned without their consent.
Cloning could lead to the creation of a new class of people who are seen as inferior or less human. For example, cloned humans could be seen as property of their ""parents"" or as less deserving of rights and protections.
Cloning could have a negative impact on society as a whole. For example, it could lead to increased inequality, decreased social cohesion, and a loss of faith in humanity.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to ban human cloning is a complex one. There are strong arguments on both sides of the issue. However, the potential risks and ethical concerns associated with cloning are serious enough that it is important to proceed with caution.","Sure, here is a summary of the arguments for banning human cloning:

    - Evidence 3: A report by the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2007 found that private military companies can carry out sensitive missions, such as covert operations, reducing the risk of harm to regular army personnel..
    - Evidence 4: A report by the RAND Corporation in 2013 found that private military companies often invest in advanced technology, allowing them to carry out their operations with greater safety and effectiveness..
    - Evidence 5: A report by the Heritage Foundation in 2010 found that private military companies can provide support services, such as logistics and communications, improving overall safety by freeing up regular army personnel to focus on other tasks..
","The opponents of banning private military companies argue that they offer a number of benefits, including:

Financial benefits: Private military companies can be more cost-effective than traditional military personnel, due to their ability to quickly respond to changing circumstances, provide access to specialized skills and expertise, and offer greater flexibility in terms of hiring and deploying personnel.
Training and equipment benefits: Private military companies typically require their personnel to have high levels of training and experience, and often invest in advanced technology. This can lead to improved safety and effectiveness.
Supplementing regular armies: Private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies cannot, or do not want, to do. This can include providing support services, such as logistics and communications, or carrying out sensitive missions, such as covert operations.
However, there are also a number of concerns about the use of private military companies, including:

Accountability: Private military companies are not subject to the same level of accountability as traditional military personnel. This can lead to human rights abuses, impunity, and a lack of transparency.
Lack of oversight: There is a lack of oversight and regulation of private military companies. This can lead to the use of mercenaries, the proliferation of arms, and the exploitation of natural resources.
Increased risk of conflict: The use of private military companies can increase the risk of conflict. This is because they can be used to train and equip local militias, which can then be used to wage war against the government or other groups.
Overall, there are both pros and cons to the use of private military companies. It is important to weigh these factors carefully before deciding whether or not to ban them.

In my opinion, the use of private military companies should be carefully regulated. They should be subject to the same level of accountability as traditional military personnel, and there should be greater oversight and transparency. With proper regulation, private military companies can play a valuable role in providing support to regular armies. However, without regulation, they pose a serious risk to human rights and security.","The opponents of banning private military companies argue that they offer a number of benefits, including:

","The debate on whether or not to ban child actors is a complex one. There are many arguments on both sides of the issue.

Arguments in favor of banning child actors:

Children are more vulnerable to exploitation than adults. They may be forced to work long hours, they may be exposed to harmful content, and they may not be paid fairly.
Child acting can have a negative impact on a child's education and social development. They may miss school, they may have difficulty making friends, and they may struggle to adjust to a normal life after they leave the industry.
There are many other ways for children to express themselves and achieve success. They can participate in sports, music, art, or other extracurricular activities.
Arguments against banning child actors:

Acting can be a positive experience for children. It can help them develop their creativity, confidence, and communication skills.
Some children have a natural talent for acting and may be able to make a successful career out of it.
There are laws and regulations in place to protect child actors. These laws ensure that children are not exploited and that they receive a fair wage.
Ultimately, parents should be the ones to decide whether or not their child should be an actor.
My opinion:

I believe that the decision of whether or not to allow child actors should be made on a case-by-case basis. There are many factors to consider, such as the child's age, maturity level, and the type of work they will be doing. I do not believe that a blanket ban on child actors is the answer. However, I do believe that there needs to be strong safeguards in place to protect children who do choose to act.

Here are some additional thoughts on the issue:

I think it is important for parents to be aware of the potential risks and benefits of child acting before they make a decision. They should talk to their children about their dreams and goals, and they should research the industry to make sure that their child will be safe and well-supported.
I think it is also important for the entertainment industry to take steps to protect child actors. They should have clear policies in place regarding working hours, pay, and safety. They should also provide training for parents and child actors on how to identify and report abuse.
I believe that with the right safeguards in place, child acting can be a positive experience for children. It can help them develop their talents and skills, and it can give them a sense of accomplishment. However, it is important to remember that children are still children, and they need to be protected.","The debate on whether or not to ban child actors is a complex one.

","Should we ban the use of child actors?

There are many arguments for and against banning the use of child actors. Some people believe that child actors are at risk of exploitation, while others believe that they can benefit from the experience.

Arguments in favor of banning child actors:

Child actors are at risk of exploitation. They may be forced to work long hours, they may not be paid a fair wage, and they may be exposed to adult material.
Child actors may miss out on important childhood experiences. They may not be able to attend school, they may not be able to play with friends, and they may not be able to have a normal childhood.
Child actors may develop mental health problems. The pressure of being a child actor can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression.
Arguments against banning child actors:

Some child actors enjoy their work. They love performing, and they enjoy the attention that comes with being a star.
Child actors can learn valuable skills from their work. They can learn how to work hard, they can learn how to deal with stress, and they can learn how to be professional.
Banning child actors would deprive the world of talented performers. Some of the most famous and successful actors in the world got their start as child actors.
Conclusion:

The decision of whether or not to ban child actors is a complex one. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what they believe is best for children.

Here are some additional thoughts on the issue:

The laws and regulations governing child labor vary from country to country. In some countries, there are strict laws that protect child actors, while in other countries, there are few or no regulations.
The entertainment industry is a competitive and demanding industry. Child actors who are successful in this industry often have to work long hours and make many sacrifices.
There are many stories of child actors who have gone on to have successful and fulfilling careers. However, there are also many stories of child actors who have struggled with addiction, mental health problems, and other personal issues.
If you are considering allowing your child to become a child actor, it is important to do your research and to make sure that you understand the risks involved. You should also make sure that your child is mature enough to handle the demands of the job.","**Should we ban the use of child actors?**

"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
    - Evidence 2: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 3: High-Value Enemy Combatant Defined.--In this section, the term  ``high-value enemy combatant'' means an enemy combatant who--(1) is a senior member of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group; (2) has knowledge of an imminent terrorist threat against the United States or its territories, the Armed Forces of the United States, the people or organizations of the United States, or an ally of the United States;  (3) has, or has had, direct involvement in planning or preparing a terrorist action against the United States or an ally of the United States or in assisting the leadership of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group in  planning or preparing such a terrorist action; or (4) if released from detention, would constitute a clear and continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the United States..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
    - Evidence 3: “The president has been really explicit ... that Gitmo is a very, very important tool,” Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said on Fox News this morning. It's also important to understand that Guantanamo Bay is an incredibly important intelligence asset..
    - Evidence 4: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..
    - Evidence 5: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..

"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241..
    - Evidence 3: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
    - Evidence 4: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
    - Evidence 2: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 3: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
    - Evidence 4: Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad..
    - Evidence 5: The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
    - Evidence 3: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.

    - Evidence 1: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
    - Evidence 2: In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher..

 Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241..
    - Evidence 3: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
    - Evidence 4: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
    - Evidence 2: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 3: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
    - Evidence 4: Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad..
    - Evidence 5: The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
    - Evidence 3: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..

","The Guantanamo Bay detention camp has been a controversial issue since its opening in 2002. Supporters of the camp argue that it is necessary to detain suspected terrorists and prevent them from carrying out attacks. Opponents of the camp argue that it is a violation of human rights and that it has damaged the United States' reputation around the world.

Here are some of the arguments in favor of closing Guantanamo Bay:

Detainees have the right to a fair trial. The United States Constitution guarantees the right to a fair trial, and this right should not be denied to anyone, even suspected terrorists. Detainees at Guantanamo Bay have been denied this right, and they have been held for years without being charged with a crime.
The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is a symbol of injustice. The camp has become a symbol of injustice around the world. It is seen as a place where people can be detained indefinitely without charge and where they can be subjected to torture. This has damaged the United States' reputation and made it more difficult to fight terrorism.
The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is expensive. The camp has cost the United States billions of dollars to operate. This money could be better spent on other things, such as fighting terrorism or improving the lives of American citizens.
Here are some of the arguments against closing Guantanamo Bay:

Some detainees are dangerous terrorists. Some of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay are dangerous terrorists who pose a threat to the United States. If they are released, they could carry out attacks that could kill innocent people.
Closing Guantanamo Bay would send a message to terrorists that they can win. If the United States closes Guantanamo Bay, it would send a message to terrorists that they can win. This could encourage them to carry out more attacks.
There is no safe place to transfer detainees. There is no safe place to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay. Many countries are unwilling to accept them, and those that are willing may not be able to ensure their safety.
The debate over Guantanamo Bay is likely to continue for many years to come. There are strong arguments on both sides of the issue, and it is a difficult decision to make. However, it is important to remember that the United States is a country that is founded on the rule of law. We should not detain people indefinitely without charge or subject them to torture. We should also remember that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp is expensive and that the money could be better spent on other things.","**The Guantanamo Bay detention camp has been a controversial issue since its opening in 2002.

","Affirmative Action

Affirmative action is a policy that aims to increase opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups, such as women and minorities. It is often used in employment and education, and can take a variety of forms, such as setting quotas or giving preferential treatment to certain groups.

There are many arguments in support of affirmative action. Supporters argue that it is necessary to address the legacy of historical discrimination and to create a more level playing field for all groups. They also argue that affirmative action can lead to a more diverse and inclusive society, which is beneficial for everyone.

There are also some arguments against affirmative action. Opponents argue that it is unfair to give preferential treatment to certain groups, and that it can lead to reverse discrimination. They also argue that affirmative action can lower standards and that it can be used to justify quotas and other forms of discrimination.

The debate over affirmative action is complex and there are no easy answers. However, it is an important issue that deserves careful consideration.

Arguments in Support of Affirmative Action

Affirmative action boosts diversity. A diverse workforce and student body is beneficial for everyone. It exposes people to different perspectives and experiences, which can lead to better decision-making and problem-solving.
Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past. Historically, women and minorities have been discriminated against in employment and education. Affirmative action can help to level the playing field and create a more just society.
Affirmative action reduces discrimination. By increasing the representation of women and minorities in positions of power, affirmative action can help to break down stereotypes and prejudices.
Arguments Against Affirmative Action

Affirmative action is unfair to give preferential treatment to certain groups. It is unfair to give someone a job or a spot in school over someone who is more qualified simply because of their race or gender.
Affirmative action can lead to reverse discrimination. Reverse discrimination is when a member of a majority group is discriminated against because of their race or gender. This can happen when affirmative action programs are used to give preferential treatment to minority groups.
Affirmative action can lower standards. When affirmative action programs are used to admit students or hire employees who are not as qualified as other candidates, it can lower standards. This can have a negative impact on the quality of education or the workforce.
Conclusion

The debate over affirmative action is complex and there are no easy answers. However, it is an important issue that deserves careful consideration. Affirmative action can be a valuable tool for promoting diversity and equality, but it is important to use it carefully to avoid the negative consequences of reverse discrimination and lowered standards.","**Affirmative Action**

","Affirmative Action

Affirmative action is a policy that aims to increase opportunities for historically disadvantaged groups, such as racial minorities and women. It is often used in college admissions, employment, and government contracting.

There is a long and heated debate over affirmative action. Supporters argue that it is necessary to address the legacy of discrimination and to ensure that all people have an equal chance to succeed. Opponents argue that affirmative action is unfair to individuals who are not members of historically disadvantaged groups and that it can lead to reverse discrimination.

The following are some of the arguments in favor of ending affirmative action:

Affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities. When people are admitted to college or hired for a job based on their race or ethnicity, it can send the message that they are not qualified on their own merits. This can be demoralizing for minority students and employees, and it can also lead to resentment from other groups.
Affirmative action is ineffective. There is no evidence that affirmative action has had a significant impact on closing the achievement gap between minority and white students. In fact, some studies have shown that affirmative action may actually have a negative impact on minority students, by lowering expectations and making it more difficult for them to succeed.
Affirmative action is not just. Affirmative action policies often give preferential treatment to minority students and employees, even when they are not as qualified as other applicants. This can be seen as unfair to individuals who are not members of historically disadvantaged groups.
Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice. Affirmative action can reinforce the idea that people of color are not as capable as white people. This can lead to increased discrimination and make it more difficult for minorities to succeed in society.
The following are some of the arguments against ending affirmative action:

Affirmative action is necessary to address the legacy of discrimination. For centuries, people of color have been discriminated against in education, employment, and housing. Affirmative action is a way to address this legacy and to ensure that all people have an equal chance to succeed.
Affirmative action can help to create a more diverse society. A diverse society is a stronger society. Affirmative action can help to create a more diverse workforce and student body, which can lead to new ideas and perspectives.
Affirmative action is fair. Affirmative action does not give preferential treatment to minority students and employees. It simply gives them a fair chance to compete.
Affirmative action does not perpetuate prejudice. Affirmative action can help to break down stereotypes and to create a more inclusive society.
The debate over affirmative action is complex and there are no easy answers. It is a debate that is likely to continue for many years to come.","**Affirmative Action**

","Should we end mandatory retirement?

Arguments in favor of ending mandatory retirement:

A mandatory retirement age decreases institutional knowledge. When older workers are forced to retire, they take with them a wealth of institutional knowledge and experience. This can be a significant loss for organizations, as it can take time for new employees to learn the ropes.
A mandatory retirement age harms the economy. Older workers are a valuable asset to the workforce. They have experience, skills, and knowledge that can be invaluable to employers. Forcing them to retire can lead to a decrease in labor force participation, which can harm economic growth.
A mandatory retirement age is not fair/discriminatory. Mandatory retirement ages are based on age, which is a protected class under anti-discrimination laws. Forcing people to retire simply because of their age is discriminatory.
A mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire. Studies have shown that mandatory retirement can lead to decreased health, well-being, and social connections. It can also lead to financial hardship, as older workers may have difficulty finding new jobs or may have to take early retirement, which can reduce their retirement savings.
Arguments against ending mandatory retirement:

Some jobs require physical or mental abilities that decline with age. For example, jobs that require heavy lifting or complex decision-making may be too dangerous or demanding for older workers.
Ending mandatory retirement could lead to age discrimination in the workplace. Employers may be less likely to hire or promote older workers if they know that they can be forced to retire at a certain age.
Ending mandatory retirement could lead to a decrease in productivity. Older workers may be less productive than younger workers, due to factors such as health problems or decreased motivation.
Conclusion:

The arguments in favor of ending mandatory retirement are strong. Older workers are a valuable asset to the workforce, and forcing them to retire can harm the economy, individuals, and society as a whole. However, there are some legitimate concerns about ending mandatory retirement, such as the potential for age discrimination and decreased productivity. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to end mandatory retirement is a complex one that should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific circumstances of each job and organization.","**Should we end mandatory retirement?**

","Topic: We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons.

Opponents' stance: Nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence.

Evidence supporting opponents' stance:

Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years.
The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory.
Response:

The opponents' arguments are based on the assumption that nuclear weapons are necessary to deter aggression. However, there is no guarantee that nuclear deterrence will always work. In fact, there is a risk that nuclear weapons could be used accidentally or intentionally, leading to a nuclear war that would be devastating for all of humanity.

The invasion of Ukraine is a reminder that nuclear deterrence is not foolproof. Russia's decision to invade Ukraine despite the risk of NATO retaliation shows that some leaders are willing to take risks, even if it means the possibility of nuclear war.

The abolition of nuclear weapons is the only way to guarantee that they will never be used. It is a long and difficult process, but it is a goal worth striving for.

In addition to the arguments presented above, there are a number of other reasons why we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. These include:

Nuclear weapons are a threat to global security. They could be used accidentally, intentionally, or by terrorists.
Nuclear weapons are a waste of money. The money spent on nuclear weapons could be used to fund other priorities, such as education, healthcare, or climate change mitigation.
Nuclear weapons are a threat to the environment. The use of nuclear weapons would release large amounts of radiation into the environment, causing widespread damage.
We must not give up hope that nuclear weapons can be abolished. It is a goal worth fighting for, and it is a goal that we can achieve if we work together.","**Topic:** We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons.

"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, said Deepti Choubey, senior director of nuclear and bio-security at the Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington. These are the materials that a terrorist would use to make a kind of bomb that you would use for nuclear terrorism attacks and they are currently spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world..
    - Evidence 2: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
    - Evidence 3: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 4: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
    - Evidence 5: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 2: More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and other NATO countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a single nuclear warning shot, according to a terrifying simulation..
    - Evidence 3: Max Tegmark: Soviet Sub Captain Decides to Fire Nuclear Torpedo During Cuban Missile Crisis To me, this is both harrowing and educational: it shows how great risk can come from the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings that couldn’t start a nuclear war on their own, but can provide the perfect storm when combined. The fact that it remained secret for decades also suggests that there may be recent scary incidents that we haven’t yet heard of..
    - Evidence 4: David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack. Additionally, the fact that it happened so recently highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago..
    - Evidence 5: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..

Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands. There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world. This material could be used by terrorists or rogue states to create nuclear weapons.

Nuclear weapons are necessary to deter war. Nuclear weapons have prevented a major war between the great powers since World War II. Without nuclear weapons, these countries would be more likely to go to war with each other.
The abolition of nuclear weapons would make the world more dangerous. If nuclear weapons were abolished, other countries would be more likely to develop them. This would increase the risk of nuclear war.

Nuclear weapons are a major threat to the environment. A nuclear war would release large amounts of radiation into the atmosphere, which would cause widespread environmental damage.
Nuclear weapons are a major economic burden. The countries that possess nuclear weapons spend billions of dollars each year on their nuclear arsenals. This money could be better spent on other things, such as education, healthcare, or poverty reduction.
Nuclear weapons are a moral hazard. The existence of nuclear weapons creates an incentive for countries to use them, or to threaten to use them, in order to achieve their political goals. This makes the world a more dangerous place.

","The opponents of the statement ""We should fight urbanization"" argue that it has many benefits, including:

Cities offer more opportunities. Urban areas tend to have more job opportunities, better educational institutions, and more cultural and recreational amenities than rural areas. This makes them attractive places to live for people of all ages and backgrounds.
Urbanization benefits the economy. Cities are engines of economic growth. They generate more tax revenue, attract more investment, and create more jobs than rural areas. This is because cities are more productive places to do business. They have agglomeration economies, which means that businesses can benefit from being located close to other businesses and suppliers.
Urbanization benefits the environment. Cities are more efficient users of resources than rural areas. They have higher population densities, which means that they can provide services such as transportation, water, and waste disposal more efficiently. Cities also tend to have lower rates of pollution than rural areas.
Of course, urbanization also has some challenges, such as:

Poverty and inequality. Cities can be very expensive places to live, which can make it difficult for low-income people to afford housing, food, and other necessities. This can lead to high rates of poverty and inequality in urban areas.
Crime and violence. Cities tend to have higher rates of crime and violence than rural areas. This is due to a number of factors, including poverty, inequality, and social disorganization.
Environmental problems. Cities can generate a lot of pollution, which can contribute to climate change, air pollution, and water pollution.
Overall, the opponents of the statement ""We should fight urbanization"" argue that the benefits of urbanization outweigh the challenges. They believe that cities are essential for economic growth and prosperity, and that they can be made more sustainable through careful planning and management.","The opponents of the statement ""We should fight urbanization"" argue that it has many benefits, including:

* **Cities offer more opportunities.** Urban areas tend to have more job opportunities, better educational institutions, and more cultural and recreational amenities than rural areas. This makes them attractive places to live for people of all ages and backgrounds.
* **Urbanization benefits the economy.** Cities are engines of economic growth. They generate more tax revenue, attract more investment, and create more jobs than rural areas. This is because cities are more productive places to do business. They have agglomeration economies, which means that businesses can benefit from being located close to other businesses and suppliers.
* **Urbanization benefits the environment.** Cities are more efficient users of resources than rural areas. They have higher population densities, which means that they can provide services such as transportation, water, and waste disposal more efficiently. Cities also tend to have lower rates of pollution than rural areas.

Of course, urbanization also has some challenges, such as:

* **Poverty and inequality.** Cities can be very expensive places to live, which can make it difficult for low-income people to afford housing, food, and other necessities. This can lead to high rates of poverty and inequality in urban areas.
* **Crime and violence.** Cities tend to have higher rates of crime and violence than rural areas. This is due to a number of factors, including poverty, inequality, and social disorganization.
* **Environmental problems.** Cities can generate a lot of pollution, which can contribute to climate change, air pollution, and water pollution.

Overall, the opponents of the statement ""We should fight urbanization"" argue that the benefits of urbanization outweigh the challenges. They believe that cities are essential for economic growth and prosperity, and that they can be made more sustainable through careful planning and management."

","Sure, I can summarize the given debate material.

The topic of the debate is whether we should fight urbanization. The positive supporters of this stance argue that restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially, urbanization causes crime, urbanization harms the environment, and urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.

Here is a more detailed summary of each of these arguments:

Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially. When people migrate to cities, they often leave behind their rural communities, which can lead to economic decline and social isolation. In addition, rural areas often lack the resources to support the influx of new people, which can lead to overcrowding, poor sanitation, and other problems.
Urbanization causes crime. There is a strong correlation between urbanization and crime rates. This is likely due to a number of factors, including the concentration of poverty, unemployment, and social disorganization in cities.
Urbanization harms the environment. Urbanization can have a number of negative impacts on the environment, including air pollution, water pollution, and deforestation. In addition, cities often consume a disproportionate amount of resources, such as water and energy.
Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources. The rapid growth of cities is putting a strain on their resources, such as housing, infrastructure, and public services. This can lead to problems such as overcrowding, traffic congestion, and pollution.
The opponents of this stance argue that urbanization is a natural and inevitable process, and that it can lead to economic growth and social development. They also argue that the negative impacts of urbanization can be mitigated through careful planning and management.

Ultimately, the debate over whether we should fight urbanization is a complex one. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. However, it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of urbanization, and to take steps to mitigate these impacts.","Sure, I can summarize the given debate material.

","Sure, I can summarize the arguments against compulsory voting.

Argument 1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.

People who abstain from voting are not necessarily apathetic or uninterested in politics. They may have a strong opinion about the candidates or the issues, but they may also believe that none of the candidates represent their views or that the election is not important enough to warrant their time and effort.

Argument 2: Citizens have a right not to vote.

Compulsory voting violates the right to freedom of choice. People should be free to participate in the political process or not, as they see fit. Forcing people to vote undermines their right to self-determination.

Argument 3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.

When people are forced to vote, they may not take the time to learn about the candidates or the issues. This can lead to uninformed voting, which can undermine the democratic process.

Argument 4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.

Some people are unable to vote because of work, family obligations, or other commitments. Compulsory voting does not take these factors into account, and it can disenfranchise people who are unable to vote on election day.

In addition to these arguments, opponents of compulsory voting also argue that it is expensive and time-consuming to enforce. They also argue that it can lead to voter fraud and corruption.

Proponents of compulsory voting argue that it increases voter turnout, which makes elections more representative of the population. They also argue that it helps to educate voters about the candidates and the issues.

","Sure, here is a summary of the arguments for compulsory voting:

Compulsory voting increases representation. When everyone is required to vote, candidates have to appeal to a wider range of voters, which can lead to more policies that reflect the interests of the majority. This is in contrast to voluntary voting systems, where candidates can focus on appealing to the interests of their base, which can lead to a more polarized political system.
Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. When people are required to vote, they are more likely to pay attention to political news and debates. This can lead to a more informed electorate, which can make better decisions about who to vote for.
People have an obligation to vote. Voting is a fundamental right and responsibility of citizenship. It is a way for people to have a say in how their government is run. When people do not vote, they are essentially giving up their voice and allowing others to make decisions for them.
There are also some potential drawbacks to compulsory voting, such as:

It could lead to people voting uninformed. If people are required to vote, they may not take the time to learn about the candidates and the issues. This could lead to uninformed voters making decisions that they later regret.
It could be seen as an infringement on individual liberties. Some people believe that the government should not force people to do something as important as voting. They argue that voting should be a voluntary act.
Overall, the arguments for and against compulsory voting are complex and there is no easy answer. However, the potential benefits of compulsory voting, such as increased representation, more informed voters, and a stronger democracy, are worth considering.","Sure, here is a summary of the arguments for compulsory voting:

This is in contrast to voluntary voting systems, where candidates can focus on appealing to the interests of their base, which can lead to a more polarized political system.
* **Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.** When people are required to vote, they are more likely to pay attention to political news and debates. This can lead to a more informed electorate, which can make better decisions about who to vote for.
* **People have an obligation to vote.** Voting is a fundamental right and responsibility of citizenship. It is a way for people to have a say in how their government is run. When people do not vote, they are essentially giving up their voice and allowing others to make decisions for them.

There are also some potential drawbacks to compulsory voting, such as:

* **It could lead to people voting uninformed.** If people are required to vote, they may not take the time to learn about the candidates and the issues. This could lead to uninformed voters making decisions that they later regret.
* **It could be seen as an infringement on individual liberties.** Some people believe that the government should not force people to do something as important as voting. They argue that voting should be a voluntary act.

Overall, the arguments for and against compulsory voting are complex and there is no easy answer. However, the potential benefits of compulsory voting, such as increased representation, more informed voters, and a stronger democracy, are worth considering."
"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
    - Evidence 2: A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke..
    - Evidence 3: For example, the Board representative is quoted as having said that we might end up in the next 10 or 20 years with our psychiatric hospitals filled with people who have problems with cannabis, and that a recent study by the British Lung Foundation found smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
    - Evidence 2: A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash..
    - Evidence 3: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
    - Evidence 2: Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs..
    - Evidence 3: The Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse..
    - Evidence 4: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
    - Evidence 5: Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Despite more than $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005, the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys.
    - Evidence 2: Despite over $7 billion spent annually towards arresting[REF] and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005 (FBI Uniform Crime Reports), the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys..
    - Evidence 3: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 4: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..

    - Evidence 1: Take California for example: first in the nation to legalize the medical use of the drug in 1996, the state would go on to legalize recreational use in 2016. But in just the past year, the state reported several massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza – just over the last three or four months..

","Sure, here is a summary of the arguments for and against legalizing cannabis, based on the evidence you have provided:

Arguments in favor of legalizing cannabis

Cannabis is less harmful than alcohol or tobacco.
Cannabis has medicinal benefits, such as relieving pain and nausea.
Legalizing cannabis would reduce crime, as it would take the drug trade out of the hands of criminals.
Legalizing cannabis would generate tax revenue that could be used to fund important programs, such as education and healthcare.
Legalizing cannabis would give adults the freedom to make their own choices about whether or not to use the drug.
Arguments against legalizing cannabis

Cannabis can impair judgment and coordination, which can lead to accidents.
Cannabis can be addictive.
Cannabis use can lead to mental health problems, such as psychosis.
Legalizing cannabis would make it more accessible to minors, who are more vulnerable to the negative effects of the drug.
Legalizing cannabis would send the wrong message to young people, and could lead to an increase in drug use overall.
It is important to note that the evidence on the effects of cannabis is complex and there is no clear consensus on the issue. Some studies have shown that cannabis can have negative health effects, while others have shown that it is relatively harmless. More research is needed to fully understand the risks and benefits of cannabis use.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to legalize cannabis is a complex one that must be made by each individual society. There are both pros and cons to legalization, and the decision should be based on a careful consideration of all the evidence.

In addition to the arguments presented above, there are a number of other factors that should be considered when making a decision about whether or not to legalize cannabis. These factors include:

The cultural and social norms of the society in question
The level of public support for legalization
The potential impact of legalization on crime rates
The potential impact of legalization on public health
The potential impact of legalization on the economy
It is important to weigh all of these factors carefully before making a decision about whether or not to legalize cannabis.","Sure, here is a summary of the arguments for and against legalizing cannabis, based on the evidence you have provided:

"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: In 2001, the New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group stated that decriminalizing cannabis will result in greater availability of resources to respond to more serious crimes without any increased risks to public safety..
    - Evidence 3: Psychopharmacologist David Nutt argues, though he is against full declassification, that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco, which, if they were invented today would be illegal..
    - Evidence 4: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
    - Evidence 5: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
    - Evidence 3: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 3: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The Connecticut Law Revision Commission made the following evaluation: (1) the costs of arresting and prosecuting marijuana offenders were significantly lower in states that had done away with criminal penalties for possessing small amounts; (2) there was a greater increase in marijuana use in states that continue to treat possession as crime than in states that treated it as a civil offense; (3) easing the penalties for marijuana did not lead to a substantial increase in the use of either alcohol or hard drugs..
    - Evidence 2: The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many unintended negative consequences of drug enforcement..
    - Evidence 3: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
    - Evidence 4: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
    - Evidence 5: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..

    - Evidence 2: The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many unintended negative consequences of drug enforcement..
    - Evidence 3: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
    - Evidence 4: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
    - Evidence 5: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.

","Sure, here is a summary of the debate material you have provided, with evidence supporting each argument:

Argument 1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.

Evidence: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse.
Conclusion: Marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and tobacco, and should therefore be legalized.
Argument 2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.

Evidence: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation.
Conclusion: Legalizing cannabis would save money and generate revenue for the government.
Argument 3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.

Evidence: A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart.
Conclusion: Cannabis is safe and can be used to relieve pain and other medical conditions.
Argument 4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.

Evidence: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years.
Conclusion: Legalizing cannabis would allow for regulation and taxation, which could help to reduce its use by young people.
Argument 5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.

Evidence: The Connecticut Law Revision Commission made the following evaluation: (1) the costs of arresting and prosecuting marijuana offenders were significantly lower in states that had done away with criminal penalties for possessing small amounts; (2) there was a greater increase in marijuana use in states that continue to treat possession as crime than in states that treated it as a civil offense; (3) easing the penalties for marijuana did not lead to a substantial increase in the use of either alcohol or hard drugs.
Conclusion: Legalizing cannabis would reduce crime and save money.
Argument 6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.

Evidence: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant.'
Conclusion: People should be allowed to make their own choices about whether or not to use cannabis.
In conclusion, there are many strong arguments in favor of legalizing cannabis. These arguments include the fact that cannabis is less harmful than alcohol and tobacco, it can be used to relieve pain and other medical conditions, it could be regulated and taxed, it would reduce crime and save money, and people should be allowed to make their own choices about whether or not to use it.","Sure, here is a summary of the debate material you have provided, with evidence supporting each argument:

"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:

    - Evidence 1: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
    - Evidence 2: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..

    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The World Charter for Prostitutes Rights (1985), drafted by the International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights, calls for the decriminalisation of all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decision. Since the mid-1970s, sex workers across the world have organised, demanding the decriminalisation of prostitution, equal protection under the law, improved working conditions, the right to pay taxes, travel and receive social benefits such as pensions..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 3: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
    - Evidence 4: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
    - Evidence 5: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent..
    - Evidence 2: The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person. Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry..
    - Evidence 3: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
    - Evidence 4: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear..
    - Evidence 2: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 3: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 4: Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution in toto, there is some evidence that regulation of China's recreational venues has helped to create a legitimate female service worker with the right to refuse to engage in practices repugnant to the valid labour contract, as well as the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace..
    - Evidence 5: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
    - Evidence 2: For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word prostitution to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term criminal sexual acts..
    - Evidence 3: Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will. Most women make this decision themselves..
    - Evidence 4: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 5: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..

    - Evidence 5: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this ..

"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society . Charles Lockwood of Yale says, a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars..
    - Evidence 2: When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences..
    - Evidence 3: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
    - Evidence 4: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
    - Evidence 5: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son, while a deeply rooted son preference makes many families want a son..
    - Evidence 2: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
    - Evidence 3: In addition, primary care physicians voiced the concerns that sex selection led to invasive medical interventions in the absence of therapeutic indications, contributed to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex, and was not a solution to domestic violence..
    - Evidence 4: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
    - Evidence 5: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 3: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
    - Evidence 4: Under the tradition of son preference and the one-child policy, missing females in China are formed through sex-selective abortion, discrimination in care for females, and non-registration of girls at birth..
    - Evidence 5: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..

"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Most families opt for unisex stuffs for babies before they are born. From clothes to toys, the color of the crib to the various necessities and accessories, everything is gender neutral in most cases. With gender selection or knowing baby’s gender can help every family to buy gender specific items. This not only does away with the ambiguity but actually helps the baby to get the best stuff as well. There is also a financial aspect as after the birthing of a baby, the parents always spend money on items that are for a boy or girl respectively. Knowing the gender or choosing gender allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The economic advantage is not oft talked about but it is significant..
    - Evidence 3: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
    - Evidence 4: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 4: There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire..
    - Evidence 5: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 3: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..

"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In common usage, the phrase 'flag burning' refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest..
    - Evidence 2: In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7-2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:  In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth..
    - Evidence 3: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 5: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
    - Evidence 3: Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..

    - Evidence 1: In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
    - Evidence 3: Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..

","Should We Prohibit Flag Burning?

The debate over whether or not to prohibit flag burning is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.

Arguments in Favor of Prohibiting Flag Burning

Flags are important symbols that should be respected. They represent the values and ideals of a country, and burning a flag is a way of showing disrespect for those values.
Flag burning is an inflammatory act. It can incite violence and hatred, and it can make it difficult for people to have civil conversations about important issues.
There are other ways to express dissent or protest without burning a flag. For example, people can write letters to their elected officials, organize protests, or donate to organizations that are working to change the policies they disagree with.
Arguments Against Prohibiting Flag Burning

The First Amendment protects freedom of speech, even if that speech is offensive. Flag burning is a form of symbolic speech, and it should be protected by the First Amendment.
Banning flag burning would be a slippery slope. If we start banning certain types of speech, it could lead to a situation where the government is able to censor any speech that it doesn't like.
Flag burning is a way for people to express their grievances with their government. It's a form of political protest, and it should be protected by the First Amendment.
Conclusion

The debate over whether or not to prohibit flag burning is a difficult one. There are strong arguments on both sides, and there is no easy answer. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide where they stand on this issue.

Personally, I believe that flag burning should be protected by the First Amendment. I think that it is important to allow people to express their grievances with their government, even if that speech is offensive. I also think that banning flag burning would be a slippery slope, and it could lead to a situation where the government is able to censor any speech that it doesn't like.","**Should We Prohibit Flag Burning?**

"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls and makes our communities safer and healthier. It is a human right and it is good for the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations. Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy. In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy..
    - Evidence 3: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
    - Evidence 4: Twenty-five years after the United Nations’ Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action pledged to take the necessary steps to “remove all obstacles to gender equality and the advancement and empowerment of women,” support for gender equality is strong around the globe. Across 34 countries surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 94% think it is important for women in their country to have the same rights as men, with 74% saying this is very important..
    - Evidence 5: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: As a health professional and a researcher, Mar Nagel found that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions. They have better social and communication skills than men, possess strong memory, are sophisticated and show precision and fast reaction and response time..
    - Evidence 3: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
    - Evidence 4: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
    - Evidence 5: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address..
    - Evidence 2: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 4: The more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed..
    - Evidence 5: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Nindl, et al. (p. 51, 2016), training programs increased the number of pull-ups that women were capable of, demonstrating that they could overcome their naturally smaller muscle mass. Additionally, their research found that women performed better than men in ultra-endurance, or the ability to physical endure for a given extended period of time. These studies suggest that women excel in some abilities, and that while men are indeed stronger as a physical typicality, there are exceptions and other ways that women can compete..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
    - Evidence 3: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 4: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
    - Evidence 2: In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty..
    - Evidence 3: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 4: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
    - Evidence 5: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
    - Evidence 2: Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country..
    - Evidence 3: While fewer women might achieve such levels, as Jon Soltz, notes: There are women who can meet these standards, and they have a right to compete..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.

Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 4: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
    - Evidence 2: In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty..
    - Evidence 3: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 4: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
    - Evidence 5: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
    - Evidence 2: Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country..
    - Evidence 3: While fewer women might achieve such levels, as Jon Soltz, notes: There are women who can meet these standards, and they have a right to compete..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
","The debate on whether or not women should be allowed to serve in combat is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides.

Those who oppose women in combat argue that women are physically weaker than men and would be at a disadvantage in a fight. They also argue that women would disrupt unit cohesion and morale, and that their presence would make it more difficult for men to focus on their duties.

Those who support women in combat argue that there is no evidence to suggest that women are less capable than men of performing combat duties. They also argue that women bring unique skills and perspectives to the battlefield, and that their presence can actually improve unit cohesion and morale.

In 2013, the Pentagon lifted the ban on women serving in ground combat roles. However, there are still some restrictions in place, such as the prohibition on women serving in infantry or special operations units.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to allow women to serve in combat is a complex one that must be made on a case-by-case basis. There is no easy answer, and both sides of the argument have valid points.

Here is a summary of the arguments for and against women in combat:

Arguments for:

Arguments against:

Women are physically weaker than men and would be at a disadvantage in a fight.
Their presence would disrupt unit cohesion and morale.
It would be more difficult for men to focus on their duties if they were aware that women were in danger.

"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
    - Evidence 3: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
    - Evidence 4: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
    - Evidence 2: In an interview with CNN on January 4, Maj. General Robert Dees, the campaign chair for Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, said he didn’t think it was a good idea: “If you look at the population demographics, most women…cannot properly carry a 230-pound soldier—with a rucksack and combat vest on—off of the battlefield to save his life..
    - Evidence 3: While the majority of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves.  In addition, combat units engage in activities designed to suit men’s capabilities. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this..
    - Evidence 4: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
    - Evidence 5: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: While it may be a feel-good move for many progressives, the end result might well be to lower the standards for all troops and damage the quality of the military..
    - Evidence 2: Lower female standards also reinforce the belief that women cannot perform the same job as men, therefore making it difficult for women to earn the trust and confidence of their teammates..
    - Evidence 3: Inconvenient truth is that men and women have been each other’s most consistent distraction since the beginning of time. To pretend that we don’t know what will happen when men and women are thrown together for prolonged periods in emotionally intense situations defies common sense. Being overly academic and insufficiently adult about adult behavior isn’t just irresponsible but imperiling, and belies the deadly seriousness with which we should want combat units to perform..
    - Evidence 4: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
    - Evidence 5: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected..
    - Evidence 3: 1988 – The DoD convenes its Task Force on Women in the Military and adopts the “risk rule,” which excludes women from combat units or missions which risk exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture..
    - Evidence 4: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
    - Evidence 5: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
    - Evidence 2: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..

","The debate on whether or not to subsidize journalism is a complex one with strong arguments on both sides.

Opponents of subsidies argue that government intervention in the media would have a number of negative consequences, including:

Increased government bias: By subsidizing certain media outlets, the government would be able to exert undue influence on their coverage. This could lead to a more biased and less objective media landscape.
Less competition: Subsidies would give some media outlets an unfair advantage over others, making it more difficult for new and independent voices to be heard.
Higher taxes: Subsidies would require additional government funding, which would likely come in the form of higher taxes.
Proponents of subsidies argue that they are necessary to ensure that the public has access to high-quality journalism. They point to the fact that the traditional business model for journalism is no longer sustainable in the digital age. As a result, many news organizations have been forced to cut back on their reporting or even close altogether. This has left a void in the media landscape that subsidies could help to fill.

In addition, proponents argue that subsidies would help to promote diversity in the media. By providing funding to a variety of outlets, subsidies would help to ensure that there is not a single dominant voice in the media landscape. This would be in the best interests of democracy, as it would allow for a more informed and engaged citizenry.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to subsidize journalism is a difficult one. There are strong arguments on both sides of the issue. However, it is clear that the traditional business model for journalism is no longer sustainable. As a result, some form of government intervention may be necessary to ensure that the public has access to high-quality journalism.

Here are some additional points to consider:

The decline of local journalism: The decline of local journalism has been a major concern in recent years. As more and more news organizations have cut back on their reporting, it has become more difficult for communities to get the information they need to make informed decisions. Subsidies could help to support local journalism and ensure that communities have access to high-quality reporting.
The rise of misinformation: The rise of misinformation has been another major concern in recent years. As social media has made it easier for people to spread false information, it has become more difficult for people to know what to believe. Subsidies could help to support fact-checking organizations and promote the spread of accurate information.

United Kingdom that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom ..

","Should We Subsidize Journalism?

The decline of traditional journalism has been a hotly debated topic in recent years. Some argue that the free market will eventually correct itself and that the public will find new ways to get the news they need. Others believe that government subsidies are necessary to ensure that journalism remains viable.

Arguments in favor of subsidies

Journalism is a public good. The benefits of journalism, such as informing the public, holding powerful people accountable, and promoting democracy, extend beyond those who pay for it. As a result, the market may not provide enough journalism to meet the public's needs.
Subsidies can help to preserve journalistic quality. In the absence of subsidies, news organizations may be forced to cut costs, which could lead to lower-quality journalism. Subsidies can help to offset these costs and ensure that news organizations have the resources they need to produce high-quality journalism.
Subsidies can help to promote diversity in the news media. Without subsidies, the news media may be dominated by a small number of large, for-profit organizations. This could lead to a decline in diversity of viewpoints and perspectives in the news. Subsidies can help to support smaller, independent news organizations that may not be able to survive in the current market.
Arguments against subsidies

Subsidies could lead to government interference in the news media. If the government is providing subsidies to the news media, it may be tempted to exert undue influence over the content of the news. This could undermine the independence of the news media and its ability to hold powerful people accountable.
Subsidies could distort the market for news. If the government is providing subsidies to the news media, it may give these organizations an unfair advantage over their competitors. This could lead to higher prices for news and a decline in the quality of journalism.
The public can support journalism without government subsidies. There are a number of ways for the public to support journalism without government subsidies. These include subscribing to newspapers and magazines, donating to nonprofit news organizations, and sharing news stories on social media.
Conclusion

The decision of whether or not to subsidize journalism is a complex one. There are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to provide subsidies is a political one that must be made by elected officials.","**Should We Subsidize Journalism?**

"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
    - Evidence 2: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 3: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
    - Evidence 4: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
    - Evidence 2: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 3: Rockets and spaceflight instruments do not assemble themselves. They are designed and built by people, who get paid. They are fabricated from components which have to be manufactured and then purchased. The community engaged in the space industry includes specialist scientists and engineers, designers, graphic artists and IT professionals, as well as a vast support system: HR, catering, cleaning, etc..
    - Evidence 4: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
    - Evidence 5: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
    - Evidence 2: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 3: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
    - Evidence 4: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.

    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
    - Evidence 3: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
    - Evidence 4: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..

","Sure, I can summarize the debate on whether or not we should subsidize space exploration.

Opponents of space exploration argue that:

Space exploration can be carried by the private sector. Private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic have made significant progress in space travel in recent years. They have developed reusable rockets, flown astronauts to the International Space Station, and even sent tourists into space. These companies argue that they can do a better job of exploring space than government agencies, and that they can do it more cheaply.
Space exploration is expensive. The cost of space exploration is staggering. The Apollo program alone cost over $200 billion in today's dollars. And that's just one program. The total cost of all space exploration programs over the years is estimated to be in the trillions of dollars. Opponents of space exploration argue that this money could be better spent on other things, like education, healthcare, or poverty alleviation.
Space exploration is ineffective. Opponents of space exploration argue that it has not produced any real benefits for humanity. They point out that the Apollo program did not lead to any major technological breakthroughs, and that the International Space Station has not produced any significant scientific discoveries. They also argue that space exploration is dangerous, and that the risks outweigh the potential benefits.
There are other issues more important to fund than space exploration. Opponents of space exploration argue that there are other issues that are more important to fund, such as climate change, poverty, and healthcare. They argue that we should focus on solving these problems before we start spending money on space exploration.
Proponents of space exploration argue that:

Space exploration is a national priority. Space exploration is a national priority that has the potential to benefit all of humanity. It can lead to new technologies, new discoveries, and a better understanding of our place in the universe.
Space exploration is a driver of innovation. Space exploration has been a major driver of innovation. It has led to the development of new technologies, such as GPS, lasers, and solar cells. These technologies have benefited all of humanity, not just those involved in space exploration.
Space exploration inspires people. Space exploration inspires people and gives them hope for the future. It shows us that there is more to our world than just Earth, and that there is still much to learn about the universe.
Space exploration is a matter of national security. Space exploration is a matter of national security. It allows us to monitor potential threats from space, such as asteroids and comets. It also allows us to maintain our military superiority.
In conclusion, there are strong arguments on both sides of the debate on whether or not we should subsidize space exploration. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to fund space exploration is a political one.

"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe..
    - Evidence 3: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
    - Evidence 4: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
    - Evidence 5: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:

Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas.

The material for the debate as follow: 

 Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe..
    - Evidence 3: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
    - Evidence 4: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
    - Evidence 5: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars..

","Should we subsidize space exploration?

Space exploration is a complex and expensive endeavor, but it has the potential to yield enormous benefits for humanity. Here are some of the arguments in favor of subsidizing space exploration:

Space exploration can help us colonize the resources/lands of other planets. This would provide us with a new home if Earth becomes uninhabitable, and it would also give us access to new resources that could help us solve problems like climate change and resource scarcity.
Space exploration improves science/technology. The development of new technologies for space exploration often leads to innovations that benefit society as a whole. For example, the development of GPS technology was originally for military purposes, but it is now used by billions of people around the world for navigation, tracking, and other applications.
Space exploration is financially beneficial. The space industry is a growing sector of the global economy, and it is estimated to generate trillions of dollars in revenue in the coming decades. This revenue can be used to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and improve the quality of life for people around the world.
Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity. The Earth is a fragile planet, and it is vulnerable to a variety of threats, including asteroids, climate change, and nuclear war. Space exploration can help us to learn more about these threats and to develop technologies that can help us to mitigate them.
Space exploration unravels information about the universe. The universe is a vast and mysterious place, and space exploration can help us to learn more about its origins, evolution, and future. This knowledge can help us to better understand our place in the universe and to make better decisions about our future.
Of course, there are also arguments against subsidizing space exploration. Some people argue that it is a waste of money, and that the money could be better spent on other priorities, such as education, healthcare, or poverty reduction. Others argue that space exploration is dangerous, and that we should focus on exploring Earth rather than the universe.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to subsidize space exploration is a complex one. There are both pros and cons to consider, and the decision should be made based on a careful weighing of the evidence.

In my opinion, the benefits of space exploration outweigh the costs. Space exploration has the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, and it can also help us to learn more about our place in the universe. I believe that we should continue to invest in space exploration, and I hope that one day we will be able to colonize other planets and explore the vastness of space.","**Should we subsidize space exploration?**
