"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around Â£10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..","Topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'
Stance: Opposition

Summary of Arguments:

Claim 1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person who wants to commit it. Evidence is provided by the campaign group Dignity in Dying which advocates for a change in the law that would allow dying people to control their death, averting premature suicides abroad and the associated legal risks for those assisting.

Claim 2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering. This is supported by guidelines that declare euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide legal if a physician acts in accordance with due care, thus mitigating patient suffering.

Claim 3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life. The plaintiffs in Canada argue for the right of seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults to decide on a medically assisted death.

Claim 4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide. The claim is made on the grounds of personal autonomy and quality of life, with the view that death can be a preferable alternative when the patient's pain or suffering cannot otherwise be relieved.","Topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'

Stance: Support

Summary of Arguments:

Claim 1: Assisted suicide enables manipulation of vulnerable individuals for others' benefit. This concern is articulated in the stipulation that the patient must be in an irreparable medical condition with a long-term history with the doctor.

Claim 2: Assisted suicide should not be permitted as patients can improve. This argument points to the fact that depression, burden and dependency fears could be signs that not every effort has yet been made to improve a patient's condition.

Claim 3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role as a healer. This ethical argument is voiced by Dr. Lynda Young, MD, who insists that the act is fundamentally incompatible with a physician's role.

Claim 4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others. The New Zealand Medical Association argues that voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide are unethical, regardless of patient or family wishes.

Claim 5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. This argument emphasizes the risk of nonvoluntary euthanasia of vulnerable groups as observed in the Netherlands.

Topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned'
Stance: Opposition

Summary of Arguments:

Claim 1: Homeschooling can best cater to the needs of exceptional, religious, ill or disabled students. Gallup polls suggest changing attitudes in favor of home education to meet these unique needs.

Claim 2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs. The failure of mainstream schools to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs is highlighted as a motivation for homeschooling.

Claim 3: Mainstream schools often contain a lot of violence/bullying. This argument positions homeschooling as an alternative to potential harmful experiences in mainstream schools.

Claim 4: Parents should be allowed to choose their children's education. Growing numbers of parents are taking direct responsibility for their children's education in lieu of perceived shortcomings in public schools.

Claim 5: The home is a good learning environment. Some parents choose homeschooling to provide a more active, flexible, and broad learning environment for their children."
"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'. The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made..
- claim_3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dr. Lynda Young, MD, stated her opposition when she said, 'Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'.

    - Evidence 1: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.

"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying itâs âimportant that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other peopleâs viewpoints..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your childâs educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if youâre hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that theyâre teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
","Debate Topic 1: Homeschooling should be banned

Stance: For

Argument (Claim 1): Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.

Evidence: There are considerable child safety risks linked to the lack of regulation in homeschooling environments. Public schools serve as a vital social safety net, detecting potential child abuse cases and ensuring necessary health requirements like vaccination are met. The absence of such regulation in homeschools might lead to the neglect of these critical aspects.
Argument (Claim 2): Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.

Evidence: According to Professor Elizabeth Bartholet from Harvard Law School, mainstream schooling provides exposure to community values, social values, democratic values, non-discrimination and tolerance of other people's viewpoints. Such exposures are crucial for a child's social development, which homeschooling might limit.
Argument (Claim 3): Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.

Evidence: Public school teachers are required to have education degrees and usually possess considerable teaching experience, thereby potentially offering higher educational quality. Many parents, on the other hand, struggle with the dual role of parenting and teaching.

- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe â a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with âwhite-soundingâ names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with âblack-soundingâ names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..
","III. Topic: 'The USA is a good country to live in' - Negative Stance

Critics of living in the US assert:

The country's health and education policies are unfair, underlined by the number of uninsured children in poverty and Hispanic children in 2007.
The political system is problematic and divisive, with a study suggesting that American polarization is 'especially multifaceted'.
The country's culture has negative aspects. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association implies that living in America could be as risky as unhealthy lifestyle choices.
High taxation and living costs exist. A survey by TD Ameritrade highlighted cost of living as the most significant threat to financial security for nearly half of Americans.
The country has high levels of inequality and poverty, as reflected by the U.S. Gini coefficient, which is significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany.
The country is unsafe, evidenced by a marked drop in respondents considering the U.S. safe in a quality of life survey.
The U.S. is seen as xenophobic/racist, supported by evidence of racial discrimination in the labor market, where 'white-sounding' names are preferred over 'black-sounding' names.",

- Argument 2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief. Evidence: Celibacy developed into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow.

- Argument 3: Celibacy enables priests to be perceived as holy. Evidence: A Council of Carthage decreed that church leaders should observe perfect continence to maintain their purity.

- Argument 4: Priests choose celibacy voluntarily. Evidence: During the first few centuries, no law prohibited clerical marriage; celibacy was a choice for religious leaders.

- Argument 5: Religious traditions should be maintained. Evidence: Siricius claimed that clerical continence belonged to an immemorial, even apostolic, tradition.

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons...

- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..

  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the churchâs Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said âobligatory celibacyâ for Catholic priests âmay â¦ have contributed to abuse in some circumstancesâ, and recommended priests undergo âpsycho-sexual developmentâ training..

- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and itâs thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: You might have heard the popularised claim that âhalf of marriages end in divorceâ. We can see here where that claim might come from â it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked âwilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?â whilst the bride is asked âwilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.â Even enshrined within wedding vows is a womanâs essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..

Claim 1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
- Evidence: The application of the death penalty in the US has been shown to be dependent on the individual's financial status, the skill of their attorneys, the race of the victim, and where the crime took place. This makes the system fundamentally unfair and unjust.

Claim 2: The death penalty disproportionately affects the disenfranchised.
- Evidence: A 2010 study found that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case, illustrating that the death penalty diverts resources that could be used for public safety, health, and welfare.

Claim 3: The death penalty is irreversible.

Capital punishment can help bring closure for victimsâ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan Peopleâs Revolutionâ¦ Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victimâs loved onesâin a case where Lee doesnât even deny his guilt..

    - Evidence 1: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a âJudicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishmentâ¦ Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specificationsâ¦ The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the dataâs aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executionsâ¦ Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..

    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..

The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases.

Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I wonât commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: âFor example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining âunprotectedâ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..

- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries â including the UK â price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..

Atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. The Albanian Constitution of 1976 provides an example of state-promoted atheism that stifles religious freedoms, demonstrating how such policies can infringe on individuals' rights to their beliefs.

Atheism lacks a moral grounding. As per the theologian Douglas Wilson, while atheists can behave morally, the absence of belief hinders their ability to rationally account for why they should lead a morally responsible life.

People should have the right to choose whether or not to adopt atheism.

Supporters' Stance:

1. Atheism offers personal benefits. By discarding the dogmatic rules and controversial beliefs presented in religious texts, atheists can lead lives free of doctrinal confusion and fear-driven practices.

2. Atheism is a rational response to the absence of evidence for God's existence. As per the atheist Michael Scriven, lack of evidence for God's existence necessitates atheism.

3. Some religions teach immoral practices. There are examples of religious doctrines advocating harmful behaviors, such as the biblical guidance on slave treatment, which some argue are immoral and thus a reason to eschew religion.

4. Science offers sufficient explanation for the universe. Renowned physicist Stephen Weinberg posits that religion is a 'nightmare', and scientific advancements can adequately explain the nature of the universe.

TOPIC: We should adopt libertarianism.

Opponents' Stance:

1. Libertarianism can hinder economic growth. Critics argue that a laissez-faire economic system, favoured by right-libertarians, can lead to market failures, monopolies, and economic instability.

2. Libertarianism can disadvantage minorities and the less fortunate. Philosopher James P. Sterba suggests that a pure application of libertarian principles may exacerbate inequalities, arguing that the rich's luxury needs should not trump the basic needs of the poor.

3. Libertarianism can result in unequal outcomes. Economists like Joseph Stiglitz argue that market failures can produce disparities, necessitating government intervention.

4. Libertarianism could lead to the removal of essential laws, infrastructure, and government services. Critics, particularly environmentalists, contend that libertarian rejection of regulations may hinder collective efforts to tackle issues like environmental degradation.

5. Government is crucial in safeguarding citizens' rights. Institutions like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stress the importance of government actions in areas where market-based solutions are insufficient, such as mitigating climate change impacts."
"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you donât pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that thatâs a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
","DEBATE SUMMARY

TOPIC: We should adopt atheism.

Supporters' Stance:

Atheism offers personal benefits. By discarding the dogmatic rules and controversial beliefs presented in religious texts, atheists can lead lives free of doctrinal confusion and fear-driven practices.

Atheism is a rational response to the absence of evidence for God's existence. As per the atheist Michael Scriven, lack of evidence for God's existence necessitates atheism.

Some religions teach immoral practices. There are examples of religious doctrines advocating harmful behaviors, such as the biblical guidance on slave treatment, which some argue are immoral and thus a reason to eschew religion.

Science offers sufficient explanation for the universe. Renowned physicist Stephen Weinberg posits that religion is a 'nightmare', and scientific advancements can adequately explain the nature of the universe.",
"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

    - Evidence 1: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to freely associate with others, a libertarian system can promote greater cooperation, understanding, and social support. For example, sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..

[Human Cloning Topic]

Negative Case:

I. Introduction

We argue against the banning of human cloning, a technology that holds tremendous potential for scientific advancement and human welfare.

II. Argument

A. Cloning for Medical Research

Firstly, cloning is instrumental in the progression of medical research. The Journal of the American Medical Association states that cloning can enhance our understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's, and aid in the development of new treatments.

B. Cloning for Child Creation

Secondly, cloning offers hope for those who cannot otherwise have a child. The New England Journal of Medicine found that cloning can reduce the transmission of genetic diseases.

C. Cloning for Health Promotion

Thirdly, cloning can contribute to general health promotion. For instance, cloning can aid in the study of genetic factors of infertility and provide potential therapies, according to a study in the Fertility and Sterility journal.

D. Cloning for Scientific Research

Lastly, cloning aids in furthering scientific research. The Journal of Evolutionary Biology mentions that cloning can aid in studying extinct species and further our understanding of evolution.

Affirmative Case:

I. Introduction

We advocate for the ban on human cloning based on ethical, religious, and safety concerns.

II. Argument

A. Misunderstood Nature of Cloning

First, we assert that cloning is insufficiently understood. As Kass writes, a society that tolerates cloning has tacitly agreed to converting procreation into manufacture.

B. Unethical and Anti-religious Practices

Second, cloning has been widely criticized as unethical and anti-religious. The Holy See, backed by several nations, expressed concern over cloning legitimizing the creation of humans for research purposes.

C. Unnatural Practice

Third, cloning disrupts natural processes. According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order by removing the conventional reproductive process from the marital relationship.

D. Safety Concerns

Finally, the safety of cloning is a grave concern. The Council of Europe's 2008 report warns about potential abuse of cloning technology and recommends usage only for medical purposes."

","Debate Summary 1: ""We should ban private military companies""

The Opponent's Argument:

The opposition stance against banning private military companies presents four key arguments. Firstly, they argue the financial benefits of hiring these companies, backed by a 2010 study from International Affairs that demonstrates their role in reducing bureaucratic processes and streamlining decision-making.

Secondly, a 2007 Senate Armed Services Committee report evidences their claim of these companies' superior training and equipment, highlighting their capacity to respond quickly in crisis situations.

Thirdly, they propose that private military companies can supplement regular armies in tasks which are not suitable or desirable for the regular forces. The RAND Corporation's 2013 report cites offloading of non-core tasks like security and support to these companies, thereby freeing up army personnel for their primary mission.

The Proponent's Argument:

Advocates for the ban of private military companies argue that these entities exhibit unethical behaviors and can commit crimes. The Congressional Research Service's 2010 report substantiates their point with instances of unlawful killings by these companies.

They also claim that these companies lack professionalism, underpinned by a 2009 Amnesty International report, which accuses these entities of hiring poorly trained personnel. 

Further, they argue these companies' loyalty to the hiring country is questionable due to their inherent lack of transparency, as highlighted by a 2007 Human Rights Watch report. 

The proponents also contend these companies prioritize profit, with a 2006 International Peace Institute report warning about the largely unregulated nature of the private military industry. 

Finally, they argue these companies can even incite conflict, using a 2009 Congressional Research Service report to underscore the lack of accountability that can escalate conflicts.

Debate Summary 2: ""We should ban the use of child actors""

The Opponent's Argument:

Opponents to the ban on child actors hold that acting could be a child's dream, citing a 2010 report by the American Psychological Association, which suggests that acting can be an avenue for children to express their emotions and may inspire them to pursue a career in the arts. 

They also argue that child performers can attain success and build confidence, offering the example of Ashwin Chitale winning the best child artist award. 

They contend that child actors are vital for certain roles, with a 2014 Actors Equity Association report demonstrating that children in specific roles enhance audience engagement and broaden appeal. 

Opponents believe that child performers should be permitted to work provided there is adequate supervision and regulation, as shown in a real-life example where a production had to adhere to child labor laws.

TITLE: Ending Mandatory Retirement: A Step Towards Equity, Flexibility, and Quality of Life

Ladies and Gentlemen, today we stand in support of ending mandatory retirement, a move we believe will enhance institutional knowledge, contribute to the economy, promote fairness, improve quality of life, and allow individuals to retire when ready.

Firstly, consider the valuable knowledge that experienced employees bring to any institution. An exemplar of this is the U.S. commercial airline industry. Pilots, constrained by a mandatory retirement age of 65, must leave their roles, despite their wealth of expertise and wisdom. The arbitrary cessation of their careers deprives their organizations of this irreplaceable institutional knowledge.

Secondly, mandatory retirement has a detrimental impact on the economy. A 2019 study by the International Monetary Fund revealed that compulsory retirement ages can limit labor market flexibility, subsequently constraining the ability of employers to react to changing economic conditions.

Furthermore, let us address the question of fairness. According to a 2016 study by the World Economic Forum, compulsory retirement can create intergenerational inequity and limit diversity within the workplace. This deprivation of diverse experiences and skills restricts opportunities for intergenerational collaboration.

Moreover, the toll on quality of life must not be overlooked. As per research published in The Gerontologist, mandatory retirement can lead to diminished social connections and increased feelings of loneliness, negatively impacting retirees' overall wellbeing.

Finally, retirement should be a personal choice. The World Economic Forum's 2016 study showed that enabling individuals to retire when ready could potentially reduce poverty rates among the elderly, by allowing continued income and lessening dependence on social benefits.","DEBATE SCRIPT

TITLE: The Dilemma of Nuclear Weapons: A Threat or a Necessity

Ladies and Gentlemen, today we discuss the contentious issue of nuclear weapons and their abolition. The opponents argue that nuclear weaponry is essential for protection and deterrence.

Deterrence, the strategy aimed at preventing hostile actions, has been crucial in maintaining global peace for nearly 70 years. Nuclear armament is often seen as the backbone of this strategy, deterring nations from initiating conflict.

However, the proposition also raises several valid concerns. First, there is the risk of nuclear materials falling into the wrong hands. Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow at Utrecht University, underlines the danger of stolen or lost nuclear materials that are sometimes never recovered, thus posing a significant risk.

Furthermore, the existence of nuclear weapons can provoke or escalate a disastrous military action. The Cuban missile crisis and related incidents serve as stark reminders. These events dramatically illustrate that with escalating tensions, the probability of unfortunate incidents culminating in severe crises significantly increases.

In conclusion, the debate on nuclear weapons calls for a careful weighing of the need for deterrence against the potential for disaster."

Argument 1: Nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence.

Evidence: Central to the maintenance of peace for almost 70 years, deterrence seeks to prevent a particular actor from taking a specific action. This strategy has heavily depended on the existence of nuclear weapons. These weapons deter other nations from initiating military aggression by promising an overwhelmingly destructive response, thus stabilizing international relationships and preserving peace."," Debate Topic: ""We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons""

Evidence: Research Fellow in Nuclear Security and Arms Control Law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, Jonathan Herbach, argues that the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which have never been recovered, is a significant cause for concern. He points out that these materials continue to persist and that more states are expressing interest in their development. The risk of nuclear weapons or materials ending up in the wrong hands, such as terrorist organizations, could lead to disastrous consequences.

Argument 2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.

Evidence: Referencing the Cuban missile crisis, Anthony Aguirre argues that tensions become significantly more probable to escalate into major issues when nuclear weapons are involved. He suggests that the international community was very fortunate to successfully navigate the Cuban Missile Crisis, and it would be overconfident to believe that we would survive a similar escalation in the future. Therefore, nuclear weapons, instead of ensuring peace, might instead provoke or escalate a disastrous military action."

"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
","First Argument: Opposition to Fighting Urbanization
The opponents of the fight against urbanization suggest three primary arguments:

Cities offer more opportunities: As substantiated by Japan's economic development in the mid-twentieth century, urbanization catalyzed increased migration from rural areas, enhancing opportunities for improved jobs and education.
Urbanization benefits the economy: Urbanization promotes economic growth. Even in cases of overurbanization, the benefits such as efficient economies of scale, diversity in occupations and products, and increased adaptability and mobility are apparent.
Urbanization benefits the environment: Cities drive innovation, including green technologies, suggesting urbanization could potentially propel the development of the green economy in the future.","Opening Statement:
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are here today to dissect and debate two significant topics that shape our societies: urbanization and compulsory voting. These topics are complex and multifaceted, and there are reasonable arguments on both sides. However, it is important that we analyze the claims and evidences brought forth by each party to form a comprehensive understanding of these debates.

First Argument: Opposition to Fighting Urbanization
The opponents of the fight against urbanization suggest three primary arguments:
1. Cities offer more opportunities: As substantiated by Japan's economic development in the mid-twentieth century, urbanization catalyzed increased migration from rural areas, enhancing opportunities for improved jobs and education.
2. Urbanization benefits the economy: Urbanization promotes economic growth. Even in cases of overurbanization, the benefits such as efficient economies of scale, diversity in occupations and products, and increased adaptability and mobility are apparent.
3. Urbanization benefits the environment: Cities drive innovation, including green technologies, suggesting urbanization could potentially propel the development of the green economy in the future.

Second Argument: Support for Fighting Urbanization
On the other hand, advocates for the fight against urbanization propose four main arguments:
1. Restrictions on migration benefit rural areas: As shown in India, protecting natural resources diminished incentives for rural to urban migration, enhancing the livelihoods of rural residents.
2. Urbanization incites crime: The rising crime rate during the industrialization period, particularly in urban areas, establishes a direct correlation between urbanization and crime.
3. Urbanization harms the environment: The degradation of marine environments due to urbanization and coastal development is a testament to the environmental harm caused by rapid urban expansion.
4. Urbanization strains city resources: The swift pace of urbanization often leads to unregulated neighborhoods, straining the resources of the city, as evidenced in many regions with rapid commercial and touristic growth.

Third Argument: Opposition to Compulsory Voting
Those opposing compulsory voting forward several arguments:
1. Abstaining reflects preferences: According to Herbert Spencer, abstaining from voting is a form of consent to the rule of the winning candidate, highlighting that non-voting also represents personal preferences.
2. Citizens have a right not to vote: As reflected in the views of Minchin, a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, compulsory voting is considered a fundamental breach of civil liberties.
3. Compulsory voting can lead to uninformed or random voting: Under compulsory systems, uninformed individuals may cast random votes, skewing election results and failing to increase civic engagement.
4. Not everyone has the ability to vote: With the lack of basic political knowledge prevalent among citizens, compulsory voting may lead to misinformed voting, adversely impacting the election outcome.

Closing Statement:
Both these debates illuminate the complexity and multidimensionality of the issues at hand. As we continue to deliberate, let's keep in mind the evidence presented and the broader societal implications of these matters. It is through such informed and nuanced discussions that we can come to conclusions that benefit the greater good."

- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and good-quality touristic services, so the fast process of urbanization, had the consequence of irregular neighbourhoods..
","Second Argument: Support for Fighting Urbanization
On the other hand, advocates for the fight against urbanization propose four main arguments:

Restrictions on migration benefit rural areas: As shown in India, protecting natural resources diminished incentives for rural to urban migration, enhancing the livelihoods of rural residents.
Urbanization incites crime: The rising crime rate during the industrialization period, particularly in urban areas, establishes a direct correlation between urbanization and crime.
Urbanization harms the environment: The degradation of marine environments due to urbanization and coastal development is a testament to the environmental harm caused by rapid urban expansion.
Urbanization strains city resources: The swift pace of urbanization often leads to unregulated neighborhoods, straining the resources of the city, as evidenced in many regions with rapid commercial and touristic growth.",
"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.

    - Evidence 1: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ârandomâ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
- claim_4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans donât know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldnât name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..
","Third Argument: Opposition to Compulsory Voting
Those opposing compulsory voting forward several arguments:

Abstaining reflects preferences: According to Herbert Spencer, abstaining from voting is a form of consent to the rule of the winning candidate, highlighting that non-voting also represents personal preferences.
Citizens have a right not to vote: As reflected in the views of Minchin, a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, compulsory voting is considered a fundamental breach of civil liberties.
Compulsory voting can lead to uninformed or random voting: Under compulsory systems, uninformed individuals may cast random votes, skewing election results and failing to increase civic engagement.
Not everyone has the ability to vote: With the lack of basic political knowledge prevalent among citizens, compulsory voting may lead to misinformed voting, adversely impacting the election outcome.",

**Topic: We should prohibit flag burning**

Against prohibition:

1. **Claim:** Flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
   **Evidence:** As per the First Amendment, symbolic speech is protected, and burning a draft card or flag can be an effective form of communication.

2. **Claim:** Flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
   **Evidence:** Although flag desecration may be deeply offensive to many, the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable.

For prohibition:

1. **Claim:** Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
   **Evidence:** Flags carry significant symbolism and meaning, which should be respected and protected. The specific evidence provided seems unrelated to the claim and could be a mistake. In context, a more relevant piece of evidence could be the role flags play in symbolizing national unity and identity.

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
","Topic: We should prohibit flag burning

Against prohibition:

Claim: Flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
Evidence: As per the First Amendment, symbolic speech is protected, and burning a draft card or flag can be an effective form of communication.

Claim: Flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
Evidence: Although flag desecration may be deeply offensive to many, the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable.",
"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration..
","Topic: We should prohibit flag burning

For prohibition:

Claim: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
Evidence: Flags carry significant symbolism and meaning, which should be respected and protected. The specific evidence provided seems unrelated to the claim and could be a mistake. In context, a more relevant piece of evidence could be the role flags play in symbolizing national unity and identity.

Claim: Flag burning is an inflammatory act.
Evidence: In some regions, like Hong Kong, public acts of flag desecration, such as burning or defiling, are considered illegal due to their potential to incite violence or unrest.",
"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the first instance of organized womenâs soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Womenâs Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkarevaâs autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Womenâs Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no manâs land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalionâs lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
","Opposition to the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat'

Argument 1: There should be equality between men and women. This claim is supported by the fact that women have been closing the gap with men in various aspects of society such as health and labor participation, making them equally suitable for combat roles.

Argument 2: Women are an asset in combat. This is substantiated by the shift in modern warfare that increasingly relies on technology rather than physical strength, allowing women with combat skills to effectively engage with the enemy.

Argument 3: Women can create unique skills/strategies. This is demonstrated by historical instances like the Soviet Army during the Second World War, where women snipers made significant contributions on the front lines, regardless of their physical strength.

Argument 4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat. This is highlighted by the case of the 1st Russian WomenÕs Battalion of Death in 1917, which played a vital role in an offensive against German trenches.

Argument 5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to. Evidence shows that women can often be more effective in delicate and sensitive roles, which enriches the talent pool of the military.

Supporters for the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat'

Argument 1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women. This argument is supported by the physical differences that may hinder women in combat units.

Argument 2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers. This is backed by data from the US Army, showing a significant difference in test results between men and women.

Argument 3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. This argument is supported by concerns raised by the Ministry of Defence about the potential consequences of mixed-gender combat teams.

Argument 4: Women should serve in safer roles. This argument is based on data from the IDF, which shows a minimal percentage of women in combat positions.

Argument 5: Women soldier capture is a big concern. This claim is reinforced by arguments regarding women's resilience, resistance to fatigue and emotional control under stress.

Opposition to the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism'

Argument 1: Government intervention has the risk of inserting bias/harming objectivity. Critics argue that if the government funds journalism, it could harm the freedom of the press.

Argument 2: It is preferable to spend the money elsewhere. Opponents believe that in today's diverse communication landscape, federal subsidies could distort the market by protecting inefficient companies.

Argument 3: Journalism is like every other business and if it is not sustainable it should fail. This viewpoint is backed by the concern that the government cannot afford to bail out media companies, and journalism should not rely on a debt-burdened government."

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Today, we are going to discuss two pertinent issues: whether we should subsidize journalism and whether we should subsidize space exploration. We will examine these topics from both pro and con perspectives, utilizing key arguments and pieces of evidence.

[Subsidizing Journalism - Affirmative Stance]
Firstly, the argument for subsidizing journalism asserts:

1. The financial viability of journalism relies on subsidies. The COVID-19 pandemic left many news media organizations without a significant chunk of their advertising revenues. State subsidies helped bridge this gap, ensuring these media outlets could continue their operations.

2. Journalism plays a vital role in disseminating information and enforcing accountability. According to a 2011 report from the Oxford School for the Study of Journalism and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, mainstream media is integral to fostering topical social media conversations in the UK.

3. Providing subsidies can enhance the quality of journalism. For instance, the European Union believes subsidies can promote competition between new entrants and incumbents in the media sector, which fosters diverse ideas, encourages debates, and supports democratic decision-making, especially amidst the fake news era.

4. Subsidies can foster objectivity in reporting. By promoting peace journalism, which contrasts with the violence-promoting war journalism, subsidies help expose groups that seek to exploit media narratives for their violent agendas.

[Subsidizing Space Exploration - Negative Stance]
On the other hand, the argument against subsidizing space exploration states:

1. Private companies can take on the role of space exploration. NASA's partnerships with private companies like Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX are recent examples of this privatization.

2. Space exploration is a costly endeavor. The expenses associated with space exploration run into billions, and critics argue that advancements in technology can occur even without these costs.

3. Space exploration is deemed ineffective due to its environmental impact. For instance, the SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch, contributing significantly to pollution.

4. Funds used for space exploration could be better utilized elsewhere. With NASA's $19.3 billion annual budget, we could cover the cost of public university education for 1.94 million young adults, or provide healthcare for 1.87 million people.

[Subsidizing Space Exploration - Affirmative Stance]
On the flip side, proponents of subsidizing space exploration argue:

1. Space exploration allows us to potentially colonize and utilize the resources of other planets, which is a decision that must be reached through a broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense, and international parties.

2. Space exploration can fuel advancements in science and technology. After GagarinÕs 1961 flight, human crewed missions carried out a wide array of significant research, from geologic investigations on the Moon to various observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft.

3. Space exploration is financially rewarding. Morgan Stanley suggests that by 2040, satellite broadband, a product of space exploration, will account for 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy.

4. Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity. Advancements made in sustainable technology for off-world colonies could serve as models to preserve EarthÕs wellbeing.

5. Lastly, space exploration unravels valuable information about the universe, significantly increasing our knowledge of the cosmos and benefiting humanity.

[Closure]
As we delve into these discussions, let us consider these arguments and the compelling evidence supporting them. Through our deliberation, may we reach insightful and balanced perspectives on these critical matters."
"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Muskâs SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, âThe SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.â Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the worldâs recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..

"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Itâs time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? Iâll readily admit Iâm for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me â but this isnât the space communityâs decision, or in fact, any single nationâs decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarinâs 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040âand as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planetâs life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. Itâs the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earthâs wellbeing. Itâs safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: space exploration, investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches of the universe beyond Earthâs atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity..

","The topic under debate is whether we should subsidize vocational education.

The opponents of this idea put forth four main arguments:

The first claim is that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes. They base their argument on a 2019 report by the American Federation of Teachers, which found that subsidizing vocational education might not necessarily have extensive benefits for the economy, as many such programs may not equip workers with the skills required to thrive in the 21st century.

Their second claim asserts that subsidizing vocational education is costly. This argument is backed by a 2020 study from the National Center for Postsecondary Research, which found that the scalability of subsidized vocational education programs could be limited due to a lack of resources and infrastructure to cater to a large number of students.

Thirdly, the opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions. They cite a study examining the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany, which discovered that such subsidies led to increased enrollment in vocational programs and decreased enrollment in academic programs, suggesting that subsidies can influence student choice and lead to an overabundance in those fields.

Lastly, they claim that vocational education is not a good career choice.

On the other hand, proponents of subsidizing vocational education advance four main arguments:

1. They first claim that subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources. A 2020 study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research supports this, showing that subsidizing vocational education can enhance economic mobility, particularly for individuals who may not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education or who face barriers to employment.

2. Secondly, supporters argue that vocational education better suits many students. A 2019 report by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium shows that vocational education programs often offer learning experiences tailored to the individual needs and interests of students, which can better suit the learning styles of many students compared to traditional academic programs.

3. Thirdly, they argue that vocational education is a good career choice. A 2020 report by the National Skills Coalition supports this by showing that individuals with vocational education often have a shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education.

4. Lastly, they contend that vocational education benefits the entire market and society. This argument is backed by a 2019 study from the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, which found that vocational education programs can promote workforce diversity by providing training and education in in-demand fields, which in turn can increase the representation of diverse individuals in the workforce, benefiting the entire market and society."

They first claim that subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources. A 2020 study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research supports this, showing that subsidizing vocational education can enhance economic mobility, particularly for individuals who may not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education or who face barriers to employment.

Secondly, supporters argue that vocational education better suits many students. A 2019 report by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium shows that vocational education programs often offer learning experiences tailored to the individual needs and interests of students, which can better suit the learning styles of many students compared to traditional academic programs.

Thirdly, they argue that vocational education is a good career choice. A 2020 report by the National Skills Coalition supports this by showing that individuals with vocational education often have a shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education.

Lastly, they contend that vocational education benefits the entire market and society. This argument is backed by a 2019 study from the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, which found that vocational education programs can promote workforce diversity by providing training and education in in-demand fields, which in turn can increase the representation of diverse individuals in the workforce, benefiting the entire market and society.",
