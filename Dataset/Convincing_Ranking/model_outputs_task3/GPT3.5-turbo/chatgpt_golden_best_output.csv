"The opponents of the statement 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence' argue that it should not be made a criminal offence because it gives dignity to the person who wants to commit it, reduces suffering, people should have the freedom to choose to end their life, and the terminally ill would benefit from it. They provide evidence supporting their claims such as the popularity of the term 'death with dignity', criteria of due care concerning patient's request and suffering, physician-assisted suicide, and the wish of terminally ill patients to die by assisted suicide before their disease progresses to a critical point."
"The topic of the debate is whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offense. Supporters of this stance argue that assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die for their own benefit, violates the doctor's role, and people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. They also argue that assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better and people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others. Evidence supporting these arguments includes the requirement that the patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated', physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent, and the slippery slope argument which claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia. Overall, supporters of this stance believe that the dangers of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweigh any advantages to assisted suicide or safeguards in the initiative's text."
"The debate topic is whether homeschooling should be banned. Those who oppose the ban argue that homeschooling is often the best option for exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students. They provide evidence that many services, such as special education, are available to homeschoolers through district schools and private schools. Additionally, homeschooling allows for a personalized education tailored to the child's pace and needs, as evidenced by personal accounts. Supporters of homeschooling also argue that mainstream schools have a lot of violence and bullying, as noted by a statement from 1980. Parents should have the right to choose their child's education, as they have a deeper understanding of their child's progress and want to provide a learning environment free from government control and institutions. Finally, homeschooling provides a good learning environment, with opportunities for active learning and a broader socialization experience than traditional classrooms. Therefore, they conclude that homeschooling should not be banned."
"The debate is whether or not homeschooling should be banned. The supporters of the motion argue that homeschooling should be banned for several reasons. Firstly, homeschooling cannot be regulated or standardized, which leads to poor quality education. For example, a mother who homeschooled her seven children for 18 years in Nebraska, lacked the energy and time to provide quality education due to constant pregnancies, and the lack of regulation allowed her to get away with shoddy homeschooling. Secondly, mainstream schools are essential for developing social skills that homeschooled children miss out on, such as work experience opportunities, participation in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward. Thirdly, mainstream schools provide higher educational quality, as stated by the National Education Association. Lastly, parents are not qualified as teachers, which can lead to a one-sided point of view for students as their parents may unknowingly block or diminish all points of view except their own."
"The proponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations argue that:
- counterclaim_1: The benefits of routine child vaccinations outweigh the potential risks.
  Evidence supporting counterclaim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in preventing serious and sometimes deadly diseases.
    - Evidence 2: The risk of serious complications from vaccines is extremely low and much lower than the risks of the diseases they prevent.
- counterclaim_2: Mandatory vaccinations are necessary to protect public health.
  Evidence supporting counterclaim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccines prevent the spread of diseases and help to achieve herd immunity, protecting those who cannot receive vaccines due to medical reasons.
    - Evidence 2: Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and whooping cough, have been on the rise in recent years due to lack of vaccination.
- counterclaim_3: Mandating vaccinations is consistent with other public health measures.
  Evidence supporting counterclaim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Other public health measures, such as seatbelt laws and smoking bans, have been implemented to protect the public's health and safety.
    - Evidence 2: Mandatory vaccination policies have been successful in other countries, such as Australia, in reducing the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases."
"The topic of debate is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory or not. Those in favor of the topic presented five claims supported by various pieces of evidence. Firstly, routine child vaccinations are effective as evidenced by studies that showed a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Secondly, child vaccination saves lives, with an estimation that full vaccination of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections. Thirdly, routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others, as evidenced by an outbreak of measles that infected 34 people, mostly children, and virtually all unvaccinated. Fourthly, routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading, with smallpox, a contagious and deadly disease, killing an estimated 300-500 million people in the 20th century before it was finally eradicated. Lastly, children should not suffer from preventable diseases, as vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year. Based on this evidence, routine child vaccinations should be made mandatory."
"The topic of the debate is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. Opponents argue against regulation, presenting several claims and evidence to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that social media regulation is not effective, citing the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act as examples of legislation that have had little impact on the data-collection practices of companies like Facebook and Google. Secondly, opponents contend that social media regulation harms privacy, with most people feeling they have little control over how their personal information is used. Thirdly, they argue that regulation harms freedom of speech and other democratic rights, pointing to examples of countries like Vietnam where vague prohibitions on posts have restricted press freedom. Fourthly, opponents assert that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, as it may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency. Lastly, they argue that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government, citing examples of political advertisements targeting minority communities during elections to suppress voting and political participation."
"The debate centers around whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government, and the affirmative side believes that it should be. Firstly, they argue that social media regulation protects younger audiences from potential harm online. The evidence supporting this argument is a quote from Norman Lamb, which states that the government must establish an independent, statutory regulator to protect young people online. Secondly, they argue that regulation is necessary to deal with fake news. The evidence supporting this argument is a statistic stating that a solid majority of Americans believe that major news organizations routinely produce false information. Thirdly, they argue that social media regulation is beneficial to society at large. The evidence supporting this argument is the proposed legislation in the European Union that seeks to make social media platforms more transparent and to outlaw psychologically manipulative techniques designed to keep users engaged. Fourthly, they argue that social media regulation can help deal with negative content. The evidence supporting this argument is a quote from Richard Pursey, stating that online safety is a fundamental human right, and forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety. Lastly, they argue that social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users. The evidence supporting this argument is a statistic stating that 13% of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user."
"The opponents of the topic argue that the USA is not a good country to live in due to several reasons. Firstly, the country has unfair health and education policies that disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic adults. Additionally, the political system is problematic and divisive, as the parties have intensified their divisions over time, making it harder to find common ground. Secondly, the country's culture is negative and misuses digital technology, spreads false information, promotes sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and influences music, television, and films. Thirdly, the country has high taxation and a high cost of living that disproportionately affects Manhattan families. Fourthly, there is inequality and poverty, with 750,000 homeless Americans, disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people, veterans, and disabled. Fifthly, the country is unsafe, with 65% of people worried about violent crime. Finally, the country is xenophobic and racist, with incidents of hate crimes against Asian Americans and women murdered at Asian-owned spas. Therefore, the opponents argue that the USA is not a good country to live in due to these various reasons."
The debate topic is 
"The opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy argue that it should be maintained for several reasons. Firstly, they argue that celibacy allows priests to focus solely on God, freeing them from other obligations and enabling them to deepen their spiritual lives. This is supported by the teachings of Paul and the increased solitude that comes from being away from the demands of family. Secondly, opponents argue that celibacy is a strong religious belief, supported by the encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus by Pope Paul VI. Thirdly, celibacy makes priests appear holy and draws on the love of God, which gives them a limitless horizon and deepens their sense of responsibility. Fourthly, opponents argue that priests choose to be celibates, as evidenced by the vows taken in front of the Bishop of Limburg. Fifthly, opponents argue that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, as celibacy is a duty that has been observed since apostolic times. Finally, opponents argue that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, as evidenced by the Archbishop of Vienna, who connected celibacy with the sex abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic Church."
"The debate is centered on whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned. Those in support of abandoning celibacy argue that it is outdated, too pressuring, unhealthy/unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behavior, and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Evidence shows that the vow of celibacy is outdated as even the Pope had commuted the vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity in 1540. Additionally, celibacy is a difficult lifestyle, as it is not just biology, but sexual chemistry that makes it difficult. Celibacy is also an unnatural act in nature, and all living organisms are meant to reproduce. Evidence shows that celibacy leads to wrong sexual behavior, as allegations of sexual abuse were made against priests and deacons in the United States in 2004. Lastly, celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests, as expressed by Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck, an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, who supported the ordination of women and ending clerical celibacy to address the priest shortage in 1971."
"The opponents of the idea of abandoning marriage argue that it has various benefits. Firstly, marriage benefits children as they receive gender-specific support from both parents, which is crucial for their development. Secondly, marriage holds immense religious and traditional significance, and is considered as one of the greatest blessings in life. It helps in raising children in a healthy family environment, which has lasting benefits. Thirdly, married people tend to be happier than unmarried people. Fourthly, marriage brings couples closer and fosters a strong sense of trust. Lastly, marriage provides significant financial benefits, including higher savings, lower tax brackets, cheaper insurance coverage, and eligibility for a larger Social Security benefit. Overall, abandoning marriage would mean giving up on these benefits and advantages."
"The debate topic is whether we should abandon marriage. Those who support this idea argue that marriage preserves harmful norms for women, marriages are unstable, marriages tie people up with unfair obligations, and most of the advantages of marriage can be achieved through monogamy. The first argument presented is that marriage is harmful to women because it enforces rigid gender roles that require women to be submissive to their husbands, leading to physical violence as punishment for transgressions. The second argument is that marriages are unstable, as divorce rates have increased globally since the 1970s. The third argument is that marriages tie people up with unfair obligations, such as in Qatar where women need male guardian permission to marry and can be considered disobedient if they do not follow their husband's wishes. Lastly, the argument is made that most of the benefits of marriage can be achieved through monogamous relationships."
The opponents of the motion 
"The debate topic is whether or not we should abandon the use of school uniforms. Those in support of abandoning school uniforms argue that uniforms harm learning and creativity, as well as self-expression. Research shows that conformity is emphasized, while creativity is not valued. Additionally, schools with a uniform policy have lower self-perception rates than those without. School uniforms are also expensive and can be a financial burden for some families. Furthermore, school uniforms can be uncomfortable and can perpetuate sexist attitudes. Finally, uniforms increase conformity and can limit individuality. It is argued that allowing children to dress themselves encourages independent thinking and prepares them for adulthood."
"The opponents of abolishing capital punishment present three main arguments in favor of retaining it. Firstly, they argue that the death penalty provides closure and justice to the victim and their family. They cite Henry McMaster, the Governor of South Carolina, who stated that the death penalty is necessary to provide victims' families with justice and closure. Secondly, they argue that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes. The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. Lastly, they contend that the death penalty deters crime. David Muhlhausen, a Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, argues that the majority of studies find a deterrent effect of capital punishment, and it saves lives. However, these arguments are not sufficient to justify the continued use of the death penalty, as there are other factors to consider, such as the risk of wrongful convictions, the potential for discrimination, and the moral implications of state-sanctioned killing."
"The topic of the debate is whether we should abolish capital punishment, and those in favor of abolishing capital punishment present the following arguments:
Firstly, state-sanctioned killing is fundamentally wrong, as the death penalty system in the US is unjustly applied, with people of color being more likely to be executed, innocent people being sentenced to death, and a disproportionate impact based on factors such as the victim's race and the location of the crime.
Secondly, the death penalty harms the disenfranchised, as it diverts resources from other cases and costs significantly more than non-death penalty cases. This cost includes the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses.
Lastly, the death penalty is irreversible, as there is no evidence that it prevents crime, and it has been proven that murder rates are lower in states without the death penalty. Therefore, it is inhumane, discriminatory, arbitrary, and often claims innocent lives. As it is disappearing from legal systems around the world, it is time for all nations, including the United States, to end it."
"The opponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that such rights incentivize creativity and innovation, as codifying intellectual property for plant breeders encourages the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society. Additionally, intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products, as many economists believe that without such protections, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced. These rights also protect against stealing and allow for compensation for people or businesses who own their innovations. Senator Leahy states that protecting Americans' rights in their intellectual property is essential to continue leading the world in producing intellectual property. Therefore, the opponents believe that intellectual property rights should not be abolished."
"The debate topic is whether we should abolish intellectual property rights, and those who support it have presented six arguments. Firstly, they argue that intellectual property rights prevent continuous improvement of a service or product, citing the example of Fox Talbot's photographic patent in 1852. Secondly, they state that intellectual property rights restrict access to important information and products, which they claim has been captured by multinational corporations. Thirdly, they argue that intellectual property rights are unfair, particularly in the context of developing countries and poor patients. Fourthly, they claim that intellectual property rights harm creativity and innovation, using the same example of Fox Talbot's patent. Fifthly, they assert that intellectual property rights waste money, especially when products involve complex methods, designs, and processes. Finally, they argue that intellectual property rights are ineffective, and that copyright is invalid because intellectual property is not scarce, unlike physical property."
"The opponents of the proposition that 'we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms' argue that gun control is ineffective since criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms illegally. Furthermore, they argue that gun ownership is a right, as established by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. They also state that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports-shooting, as shown by data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Lastly, they argue that gun ownership promotes self-protection, as indicated by a Gallup survey where gun owners cited personal safety as the primary reason for owning firearms."
"The debate topic is whether or not we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. Supporters of this idea argue that banning guns would save lives. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death, supporting the claim that guns are a threat to public safety. Additionally, gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence. A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance, further strengthening the argument. Furthermore, guns can fall into the wrong hands, leading to deadly consequences. The massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns serves as an example. Lastly, guns lead to accidental deaths, particularly among children and adolescents. So far in 2022, 209 children have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms. These pieces of evidence make a strong case for the abolition of the right to keep and bear arms."
"The opponents of adopting an austerity regime have presented several claims and supporting evidence to back up their stance. Claim 1 argues that austerity cuts access to essential services, and evidence shows that local authority budgets and public health grants were significantly reduced, leading to the closure of public services such as Sure Start centers and libraries. Claim 2 states that austerity extends recessions, with economists pointing out that these measures have contractionary effects that exacerbate ongoing economic recessions. Claim 3 highlights that austerity is unfair to citizens, with high levels of child poverty being declared a social calamity and an economic disaster by the UN's rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. Claim 4 presents evidence that austerity results in lower growth, as seen in Greece's economy after the EU and European Central Bank embarked on an austerity program to control the country's finances. Finally, Claim 5 argues that austerity results in lower job creation, with evidence showing that countries with stronger employment protection legislation experienced more unemployment due to austerity policies. Overall, opponents of austerity believe that it causes harm to citizens and economies and should not be adopted."
"The debate topic is whether we should adopt an austerity regime. Supporters argue that austerity has many benefits. Firstly, they claim that austerity improves economic measures, as evidenced by Latvia and Estonia's fast economic growth after adopting fiscal austerity. Secondly, austerity is important in the long term as cutting budget deficits increases investor confidence, encouraging private sector investment. The EU points to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg, and Sweden as proof of austerity's effectiveness. Thirdly, austerity increases stability, as seen in Morocco, which experienced economic stability, steady growth, low inflation rates, and reduced unemployment after implementing austerity measures. Fourthly, austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts. The World Bank found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period, it slows economic growth, and every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth. Finally, austerity is essential in economically troubled times, such as the global economic downturn that began in 2008. Several European countries turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns. Therefore, adopting an austerity regime has many benefits that cannot be ignored."
"The opponents of adopting atheism put forward three main claims. Firstly, they argue that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. This is evidenced by the fact that John Locke believed that denying the existence of God would lead to chaos and undermine the social order. Secondly, they claim that atheism lacks morality and that belief in a higher power is necessary to provide a rational and coherent account of why an individual should lead a morally responsible life. Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, supports this argument. Finally, opponents argue that people should be able to choose for themselves whether to adopt atheism. According to Liddle, choosing to believe in God or not is ultimately a matter of personal choice, as there is no scientific proof either way."
"The debate topic is whether or not we should adopt atheism, and the positive supporters of atheism argue the following points. Firstly, they claim that atheism is beneficial to the person who adopts it because it provides a superior basis for ethics. This is because atheists are more inclined to evaluate moral imperatives from an external basis instead of religious dogma. Secondly, atheism should be adopted because we cannot prove that God exists. Atheist Michael Scriven argues that atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence. Thirdly, religions are immoral, and people should not follow them. This is because religion confuses obedience with morality, and obedience is amoral at best, and utterly irresponsible at worst. Lastly, science can adequately explain the universe, which is why we do not need to rely on the existence of a divine being to explain the world. While some critics may argue against these points from a theistic standpoint, the positive supporters of atheism argue that it represents a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective."
"The topic at hand is whether we should adopt libertarianism. The opponents of this stance argue that libertarianism can be harmful in several ways. Firstly, they claim that libertarianism harms economic growth and cite George Monbiot's article in The Guardian linking Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy to the failure of Northern Rock. Secondly, opponents argue that libertarianism harms minorities and those who are worse off. They mention philosopher Robert Nozick's argument that a consistently libertarian society would allow consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, which would be unjust. Thirdly, opponents argue that libertarianism is unjust and non-equal. They argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and result in unequal outcomes. Fourthly, they claim that libertarianism would remove essential laws, infrastructure, and government services, citing the support of libertarianism for the legalization of victimless crimes such as drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution. Finally, opponents argue that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens. They mention the importance of the government in protecting basic human rights, which are often enshrined in constitutional documents and protected by laws and institutions."
"The supporters of libertarianism argue that we should adopt this political philosophy for various reasons. Firstly, they claim that libertarianism increases economic growth, citing the book "
"The opponents of the ban on human cloning present four claims to support their stance. First, cloning can be used for organ replication to address the shortage of organs available for transplantation, which causes many people to die while waiting for suitable organs. Second, cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility to have genetically related children. Third, cloning promotes health as it could be used to produce stem cells that could treat a range of diseases. Lastly, cloning promotes science and research as certain states in the US permit human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells, and certain forms of embryonic stem cell research are legalized in other states."
"The debate topic is whether or not human cloning should be banned, and the positive supporters argue in favor of a ban. They make four main claims to support their stance. First, they argue that cloning is not yet understood well enough to be safely practiced, and provide evidence that allowing cloning would be a dangerous and unethical decision for society. Second, they argue that cloning is unethical and anti-religious, and provide evidence from Pope John Paul II that the manipulation and destruction of human embryos involved in cloning is morally unacceptable. Third, they claim that cloning is unnatural and provide evidence from a Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist that humans are meant to be created through acts of love, not the manipulation of cells. Finally, they argue that cloning is unsafe and provide evidence from an FDA biotechnology chief that cloning could risk transferring sexually transmitted diseases to newborn children. Overall, the positive supporters of banning human cloning argue that it is a dangerous, unethical, unnatural, and unsafe practice that should not be allowed to continue."
"The opponents of banning private military companies make several claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that hiring private military companies is financially beneficial. This is supported by a study published in the journal Defense and Security Analysis in 2011, which found that private military companies can provide more efficient services compared to traditional military personnel. Secondly, private military companies are argued to be well-trained and better equipped than regular armies. This is backed up by a report by the Congressional Research Service in 2009, which found that private military companies often provide specialized training programs to their personnel. Thirdly, private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies cannot, or do not want, to do. This is supported by the same study in the journal Defense and Security Analysis in 2011, which found that private military companies can provide access to specialized skills and expertise that may not be available in the regular army. Lastly, it is claimed that private military companies increase safety. This is supported by a report by the Heritage Foundation in 2010, which found that private military companies can provide more efficient use of resources, reducing the overall cost of military operations and allowing for a greater focus on safety."
"The debate topic is whether private military companies should be banned. Those who support the ban argue that private military companies are less ethical and often violate human rights or commit crimes. For instance, a report by the United Nations in 2004 found evidence of private military companies using child soldiers in conflict zones. Private military companies are also not professional as they hire poorly trained personnel, which leads to increased risks and decreased professionalism in their operations. Furthermore, private military companies cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country, as they face a conflict of interest if they have loyalty to multiple countries, potentially leading to a lack of trust in their actions. Their main interest is profit, and they often operate with limited accountability, making it difficult to hold them responsible for actions taken in pursuit of profit. Additionally, private military companies have a financial incentive to prolong conflicts, as they profit from their continued involvement. Therefore, supporters of the ban argue that it is necessary to ban private military companies."
"The debate is centered around whether the use of child actors should be banned or not. Opponents argue against this proposition by making the following claims. Firstly, they state that acting may be a child's dream, supported by a report by the Drama Teachers Association of America that found that some children have natural talent and pursue acting as a career. Secondly, they argue that child performers achieve success and confidence, citing the example of Ashwin Chitale who won the best child artist award. Thirdly, they believe that child performers are necessary for roles, as reported by the National Association of Theatre Owners, as it increases diversity in casting and provides opportunities for more actors, including children. Fourthly, they suggest that child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation, illustrated by the example of Walsh who appears with a roster of child actors to help illustrate scenarios in which children could often be in danger. Finally, they argue that parents should decide for their child, as supported by a study published in the Journal of Family Psychology that found that parents are able to provide individualized attention and care for their children, which is important for their development and well-being."
"The debate topic is about banning the use of child actors. Those who support the ban have presented several claims with supporting evidence. Firstly, they argue that being a performer harms the child's education as child performers often miss school or receive inadequate education, leading to a lack of basic skills and knowledge. Secondly, child performers are at risk of exploitation as they are often subject to labor violations, including wage theft, lack of breaks, and poor working conditions. Thirdly, child performers are losing their childhood as they are often exploited and exposed to unhealthy working conditions, leading to the loss of their childhood. Fourthly, child performers have a lot of pressure which may lead to mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. Lastly, child performers tend to develop problems later in life, such as a lack of identity, when they are no longer in demand as a child actor."
"The opponents of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp argue that it would harm national security, as a significant number of former detainees have been confirmed or suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. The director of National Intelligence reported that approximately 17.5% of former detainees transferred to other countries have been involved in terrorism or insurgency. Moreover, the Guantanamo Bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives, as it provides humane treatment and exceeds any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested by human rights organizations and an independent commission. Finally, the opponents claim that the detention camp is essential to gain intelligence, as it was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror, and can provide a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations."
"The supporters of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp have presented several compelling arguments. Firstly, the detainees have the right to a fair trial in US courts, as per the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of Boumediene v. Bush. Secondly, the camp harms the reputation of the United States and serves as a recruiting tool for terrorists. Thirdly, the detention camp is a symbol of discrimination and injustice, and has become a catastrophic failure. Fourthly, the camp is expensive to run, costing an estimated $540 million annually. Fifthly, there have been allegations of crimes committed by personnel against the prisoners, including sexual humiliation, waterboarding, and the use of vicious dogs. Lastly, unjust treatment tactics have been used in the camp, such as stress positions, isolation, and deprivation of stimuli. Based on these arguments, the supporters of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp make a strong case for ending the controversial facility."
"The opponents of ending affirmative action put forth three key claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that affirmative action boosts diversity. Evidence shows that students of color experience a 23% decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect. Secondly, they assert that affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past. Affirmative action has been defined as any measure adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination. Thirdly, they contend that affirmative action reduces discrimination. Johnson v. Transportation Agency upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a "
"The proponents of ending affirmative action make the following claims: Firstly, affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, as it devalues their accomplishments and is counterproductive. Secondly, affirmative action is ineffective, as evidenced by Arizona's Proposition 107 which banned government-sponsored affirmative action. Thirdly, affirmative action is not just, as Asian-American students are marked down on "
"The opponents of ending mandatory retirement argue that it has some benefits that we should consider. They claim that mandatory retirement ages create opportunities for other workers. A report by the International Labour Organization in 2012 supports this claim, showing that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people. Older workers are encouraged to leave the workforce and make room for younger workers. In addition, they argue that mandatory retirement age benefits those who are about to be retired. A report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can increase financial security for workers. Workers can receive pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a specified age. These benefits should be taken into consideration before ending mandatory retirement."
"The debate topic is whether mandatory retirement should be ended. Those in support of the proposition argue that a mandatory retirement age should be ended because it decreases institutional knowledge, harms the economy, is not fair/discriminatory, reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, and we should let everyone retire when they are ready. To support their argument, they present evidence such as the absence of a mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers in the UK, a study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 which found that mandatory retirement ages can impede workforce diversity, and a report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 which found that mandatory retirement ages can result in age discrimination, among others. The proponents argue that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging, as older workers can continue to contribute to the workforce, using their skills and experience to benefit society."
"As an expert debater, I will present a summary of the arguments and evidence presented by the opponents of the proposition that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons.

The opponents of the proposition argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. They believe that deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years.

Therefore, they argue that having nuclear weapons deters other countries from attacking and provides a sense of security and protection. They contend that countries with nuclear weapons are less likely to engage in war as the consequences of using such weapons are catastrophic.

However, it is important to note that the proposition to fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons is based on the premise that the use of such weapons is unacceptable and poses an existential threat to humanity. This argument is supported by evidence of the devastating effects of nuclear weapons, including long-lasting radiation, destruction of infrastructure, and loss of human life.

In conclusion, while the opponents of the proposition make a valid argument for the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence, it is important to consider the larger implications of possessing such weapons and the potential catastrophic consequences of their use. Therefore, the abolition of nuclear weapons should remain a top priority in the quest for global peace and security."
"The debate topic is whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. The positive supporters argue that nuclear weapons should be abolished because they can fall into the wrong hands and provoke or escalate a disastrous military action. The evidence supporting the first argument is that recent propaganda from ISIS has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within a year, and history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare has never been a top priority. The second argument is supported by the evidence that in the event of a Soviet nuclear attack during the Cold War, the US would have sent thousands of nuclear weapons to targets in multiple countries, resulting in millions of deaths due to radioactive fallout and short-range missiles. Therefore, to prevent catastrophic consequences, we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons."
"The debate topic is 'We should fight urbanization'. Opponents of this argument presented three claims supporting urbanization. The first claim is that cities offer more opportunities, and this is evidenced by the fact that people often migrate to urban areas in search of better lives. The second claim is that urbanization benefits the economy, supported by new government policies that encourage the privatisation of agriculture, the urbanisation of rural populations, the development of rural industries and international investment. The third claim is that urbanization benefits the environment by driving innovation, including green technologies that will determine the future of the green economy."
"The supporters of fighting urbanization have made four claims. The first claim is that restrictions on migration would benefit people in rural areas economically and socially. They provide evidence from Venezuela, where rural areas have suffered from economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment, resulting in high urbanization rates and food dependency. The second claim is that urbanization causes crime. They provide evidence from Māori communities in New Zealand that have struggled to deal with social issues, including a rise in urban crime, poverty, and health problems. The third claim is that urbanization harms the environment. They provide evidence that increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies, and many parts of the world do not have access to clean, safe water. Finally, the fourth claim is that urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources. They provide evidence from a UNESCO report that details the negative effects of overurbanization, including inadequate housing, a lack of sanitary facilities, filth, squalor, repugnant odors, disease, high mortality rates, and limited access to educational facilities."
"The opponents of the introduction of compulsory voting make four main claims. Firstly, abstaining from a vote can also reflect a person's preferences. This is because abstention can indicate ambivalence or mild disapproval, or a lack of adequate information or participation in relevant discussion. Secondly, citizens have the right not to vote and compulsory voting violates freedom of speech as it is a compelled speech act. Thirdly, compulsory voting can lead to uninformed or random voting as uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of misleading advertising. Lastly, not everyone has the ability to go to vote and some people may vote based on intentional disinformation."
"The topic of the debate is whether or not we should introduce compulsory voting. Those in favor of introducing compulsory voting argue that it would increase representation, political education, and that people have an obligation to vote. The first argument in support of this is that compulsory voting increases representation. A report by Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne Jr. shows that boosting turnout is a matter of justice and representation, as disparities in turnout between different groups are a cause for concern. The second argument is that compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics, which will lead to higher political education. If people know that they must vote, they will be more likely to pay attention to politics. Finally, supporters argue that people have an obligation to vote. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 1971 that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms because only attendance at a polling station, and not voting itself, is compulsory. Voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper."
"The opponents of legalizing cannabis present five main arguments. Firstly, they argue that cannabis harms the body, citing a study which found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Secondly, opponents claim that cannabis increases lack of judgement and accidents, citing claims that it causes people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. Thirdly, they argue that cannabis is a gateway drug and addictive, as THC triggers brain cells to release dopamine and repeated use could lead to addiction, which is a brain disease. Fourthly, opponents claim that legal cannabis can easily get into the hands of underage teenagers and children, citing the example of UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown opposing cannabis reclassification as it sends out a message to teenagers that it is acceptable. Finally, they argue that legalizing cannabis will boost the black-market and criminal activity, citing several recent busts of illegal cannabis operations in California despite it being legalized for medical and recreational use."
"The debate topic is whether cannabis should be legalized. The positive supporters argue that cannabis should be legalized for the following reasons. Firstly, they argue that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal. For example, a 2002 DAWN report in the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found, while legal drugs such as tobacco and alcohol cause more than half a million deaths a year. Secondly, legalizing cannabis is financially beneficial as it can reduce government spending on prohibition enforcement and generate billions in annual tax revenues through taxation and regulation. Thirdly, cannabis has therapeutic benefits, as it is safe, healthy and can provide pain relief. Fourthly, if cannabis was legalized, it could be regulated, which would lead to a decrease in its use, especially among young people. Fifthly, legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market and criminal activity, which can benefit the society at large. Lastly, people should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies, and the government should not intervene to prevent individuals from using cannabis if it does not harm others. The proponents of the legalization of cannabis cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill, who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society."
"The opponents of legalizing prostitution make four claims against it. First, they argue that legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, citing a survey in Athens in the late 1980s that found 12 out of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive, and a survey in the late 1990s that found 44 foreign prostitutes were HIV positive. Second, they claim that legalizing sex work will increase immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking, citing a report by two councilors for the Labour Party in the Netherlands that found a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs. Third, they argue that legalizing sex work will increase violence against women, citing the unintended consequences of similar legislation in Sweden in 1996 that drove women in prostitution underground, increased the risk of violence, harmed the most vulnerable, and was almost impossible to enforce. Finally, they argue that selling one's body is immoral, citing feminist perspectives that see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, reducing the woman to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client and putting her in a subordinate position."
"The debate topic is about whether or not prostitution should be legalized. Those who support the legalization of prostitution argue that it has several benefits. Firstly, legalizing prostitution would boost the economy. This is evident in Seattle, where prostitution was considered a functional part of the economy and was supported by the city's founder, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard. Secondly, legalizing sex work would increase sex workers' benefits such as healthcare, safe sex, and unionization. Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health, and human rights. Thirdly, legalization would allow for regulation of those in the profession, such as in Las Vegas, where brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex. Fourthly, legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women. The policy of tolerance towards prostitution in the Netherlands was based on harm reduction, with the belief that enforcement of anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect women was to tolerate prostitution. Lastly, sex work is considered a valid choice over one's body, and a study found that among sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized. Overall, supporters of the legalization of prostitution argue that it would have various positive outcomes and benefits."
"The opponents argue that we should not legalize sex selection. Firstly, sex selection can lead to gender imbalance, as evidenced by the disproportionate number of men to women in countries such as China and India where having a male child is preferred. Secondly, sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases, which can persist even in modernized and urban areas. Finally, legalizing sex selection could lead to more abortions and infanticide, particularly in areas where there is a strong son preference and strict family planning policies such as the one-child policy in China. These reasons suggest that legalizing sex selection is not a desirable option."
"The debate topic is whether we should legalize sex selection or not. The supporters of this argument have put forward several claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that it is a basic right of parents to select the sex of their child, as most people have a preference for a particular gender. Secondly, sex selection allows for better family planning as parents can control the number of children they want. Thirdly, sex selection makes the family more happy and complete by fulfilling their desired gender preferences. Fourthly, sex selection can prevent X-linked diseases from being passed down to the child. Finally, legalizing sex selection can prevent abortions and infanticide as parents can choose the gender of their child without the need for such actions. While these arguments may seem compelling, the opposing side may argue that legalizing sex selection could lead to gender discrimination and a lack of diversity in society."
"The opponents of the proposition that 'We should prohibit flag burning' argue that flag burning is a legitimate tool for expression, protest, and critique. They support this argument with evidence, including the case of Gregory Lee Johnson, who burned the American flag during a protest against the Reagan administration in 1984. Despite being convicted under a flag desecration law, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled in Johnson's favor, citing that his actions were protected by the First Amendment as a form of expression. Therefore, opponents argue that flag burning is justified under freedom of expression."
The debate topic is whether or not flag burning should be prohibited. Those who support the prohibition argue that flags are important symbols that deserve respect and that flag burning is an inflammatory act. The first argument is that flags should be respected as important symbols. The evidence supporting this argument is that Warren believed laws against flag-burning are constitutional. The second argument is that flag burning is an inflammatory act. The evidence supporting this argument is that proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed.
The opponents of the statement 
"The debate topic is whether women should be prohibited from serving in combat roles. The supporters of the prohibition present several arguments to support their stance. 

Firstly, they argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women. They provide evidence that women are generally physically smaller and have less muscle density and bone mass than men. This makes it harder for them to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. The supporters also argue that even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent.

Secondly, they claim that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers that men can in combat roles. They provide evidence that the physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units.

Thirdly, supporters of the prohibition claim that women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. They provide evidence that men have emotions when they see a woman in harm's way, and it's very much in their culture to be protective. This can affect the performance of the military.

Fourthly, the supporters argue that women should serve in safer roles. They provide evidence that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support.

Lastly, they argue that women soldier capture is a big concern. They provide evidence that women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation, and stress, making them less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations.

In conclusion, the supporters of the prohibition argue that women should be prohibited from serving in combat roles due to their physical differences, inability to overcome barriers, potential distraction, safer roles availability, and capture concerns."
"The debate topic is whether or not we should subsidize journalism, and opponents argue that government intervention in journalism could insert bias and harm objectivity. This is supported by the fact that political endorsements can create perceived conflicts of interest. Opponents also argue that it is preferable to spend the money elsewhere, citing that postal subsidies from the past are irrelevant in today's world of multiple forms of communication and federal subsidies would decide winners and losers, protecting inefficient companies and creating obstacles for entrepreneurs. Lastly, opponents argue that journalism is like any other business and if it is not sustainable, it should fail. The federal government cannot afford to bail out newspapers as it has already bailed out undeserving banks and automobile manufacturers, and journalism should not be dependent on a debt-burdened government."
"The topic of debate is whether or not we should subsidize journalism. Those who support this idea argue that subsidies are important to make journalism viable, as it is becoming increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism. Additionally, journalism is important to information-spreading and accountability, as evidenced by the Associated Press' efficiency in producing accurate reporting. Subsidies can increase the quality of journalism through initiatives like the Ethical Journalism Initiative launched by the IFJ. Furthermore, subsidy can increase objectivity in reporting, exemplified by peace journalism which can help to expose violent groups' attempts to manipulate meaning for their own purposes."
"The opponents of subsidizing space exploration argue that it is unnecessary and can be carried out by the private sector, citing the success of SpaceX in collaborating with NASA. They also highlight the high cost of space exploration and the limited scientific value of past and future missions. They suggest that funding should be directed towards more pressing issues such as poverty, which according to UNICEF, results in the death of 22,000 children daily."
"The debate topic is whether or not we should subsidize space exploration. Supporters argue that it should be subsidized for the following reasons. Firstly, space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets. Space colonies can provide new homelands, an expanded ecological niche, and clean energy necessary for human survival. Secondly, space exploration improves science/technology. Space missions involving human crews have carried out significant research and facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science. Thirdly, space exploration is financially beneficial. The global space industry could generate revenue of over $1 trillion in 2040, with significant opportunities coming from satellite broadband internet access. Fourthly, space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity. We will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources to make planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. Finally, space exploration unravels information about the universe. From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system."
"The opponents of subsidizing vocational education put forth four arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they claim that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from other more worthy causes such as early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education. This argument is supported by a study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020. Secondly, the opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education is expensive, as these programs require significant investments in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty. A report by the Center for American Progress in 2018 supports this argument. The third argument is that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions. The opponents support this argument with evidence from a study that found a large-scale subsidy program for vocational education in Germany resulted in a significant increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs. Finally, the opponents argue that vocational education is not a good career choice as many programs offer limited transferability of skills, making it difficult for workers to transition to new careers or industries. The National Center for Education and the Economy in 2014 supports this argument."
"The debate topic is whether or not we should subsidize vocational education. Those in support of subsidizing vocational education put forth four claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources by providing a direct path to employment and better access to job opportunities. This is supported by a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019. Secondly, they assert that vocational education better fits many students and provides relevant training and education that meets current workforce needs. This claim is supported by a study conducted by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in 2020. Thirdly, supporters argue that vocational education is a good career choice, with high demand for skilled workers in industries such as healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing. This claim is supported by a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022. Lastly, proponents of subsidizing vocational education claim that it is beneficial for the entire market and society by addressing workforce shortages in specific fields and industries. The National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium's study in 2019 also supports this claim."
