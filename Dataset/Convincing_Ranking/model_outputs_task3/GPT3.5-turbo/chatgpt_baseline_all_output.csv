"The opponents of the stance that assisted suicide should be a criminal offence have presented several arguments. Firstly, they argue that assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it. Dignity in Dying, a campaign group, believes that terminally ill, mentally competent adults should be able to opt for an assisted death subject to strict rules and safeguards. They argue that this would prevent people from travelling to Switzerland to end their life prematurely, and it would give dying people control over their death. Secondly, they argue that assisted suicide reduces suffering, as seen in a ruling by a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution. Thirdly, opponents argue that people should have the freedom to choose to end their life, and that the current law on assisted suicide is "
"The topic of the debate is 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence.' The positive supporters argue that assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit. They support this claim by providing evidence that states that the patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated.' Moreover, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made. Additionally, assisted suicide violates the doctor's role, and people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others. They argue that any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted of assisting suicide or attempting to do so. Lastly, people who are ill do not have clear judgment and are in need of help. Therefore, the proponents believe that assisted suicide should be considered a criminal offense."
"The opponents of the statement 'Homeschooling should be banned' have put forth several arguments. Firstly, homeschooling is often the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students. This is supported by evidence such as the provision of special education services and the changing attitudes towards homeschooling. Secondly, homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs, allowing for a more engaged learning experience and discovery of their aptitudes. Thirdly, mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying, which homeschoolers seek to protect their children from. Fourthly, parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children as private and homeschooling are seen as better alternatives to public schools that do not meet expectations. Lastly, the home is seen as a good learning environment as it allows for a broader socialization experience and a more active learning environment."
"The debate is on whether homeschooling should be banned or not. The positive supporters of the idea of banning homeschooling presented four main arguments. Firstly, they claim that homeschools cannot be regulated or standardized, leading to poor quality education and the potential for abuse. The lack of oversight and regulation may lead to the denial of education to as many as 15-20,000 kids. Secondly, mainstream schools are essential to developing social skills, as schools offer work experience opportunities, sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward, which homeschooled children do not experience. Thirdly, mainstream schools are of higher educational quality since teachers in public schools are required to carry education degrees and have more experience working with and teaching children. Finally, parents are not qualified as teachers, and taking up the role of both parent and teacher could potentially lead to abuse or neglect of the child. Overall, the positive supporters argue that homeschooling should be banned as it is not an effective or safe alternative to mainstream schools."
"The opponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations present three main claims. Firstly, they argue that these vaccinations or their side effects can be dangerous, citing examples such as the pneumonia caused by the chickenpox vaccine and the higher instances of bowel obstruction caused by the rotavirus vaccine. Secondly, they claim that mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights, including the right to free exercise of religion and the right to bodily integrity. Thirdly, they argue that routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy, as natural infection may provide more complete immunity than vaccinations. However, the opponents do not provide sufficient evidence to support their third claim, while their first and second claims rely on isolated incidents and fail to acknowledge the overwhelming evidence that vaccinations have been proven safe and effective in preventing the spread of diseases."
"Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory for several reasons. First, vaccinations are highly effective in preventing disease. For example, vaccines have reduced deaths from polio, smallpox, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, and Hib by 99% in the United States. Second, vaccinations save lives, as it is estimated that full vaccination of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections. Third, vaccinations are necessary to protect others, as outbreaks of measles and pertussis can occur if the rate of vaccination decreases below 92%. Fourth, vaccinations prevent the spread of viruses and diseases, as demonstrated by the eradication of smallpox and the effectiveness of pertussis vaccines. Finally, children should not suffer from preventable diseases, and vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases such as measles. Therefore, it is important to make routine child vaccinations mandatory to ensure the health and safety of children and communities."
"The opponents of social media regulation argue that it is not effective as existing regulatory and voluntary initiatives have not been successful in keeping users safe. Additionally, legislation fails to hold platform companies accountable for their management of data privacy. Social media regulation also harms privacy as government use of social media monitoring software can track individuals' communication, associations, and movements. Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, leading to censorship. Social media regulation can also harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights. The proposals to regulate social media can threaten freedom of expression and violate the First Amendment and protected free speech. The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression. Finally, social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government as any process developed to address the problem cannot be made immune to political co-optation, and it can be used as an information weapon to influence public sentiment and suppress voting and political participation."
"The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. Supporters of this proposition argue that social media regulation is necessary to protect young audiences from harmful content. Evidence includes the fact that companies are obligated to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, and concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health. Supporters also argue that social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news. Evidence includes the fact that the European Union reached a deal on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, and fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Furthermore, supporters argue that social media regulation is beneficial to society at large. Evidence includes the fact that pending legislation like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act in the European Union seek to make social media platforms more transparent, and Ofcom is acquiring new technology and data skills to ensure balanced rules. Supporters also argue that social media regulation can help to deal with negative content and malicious users. Evidence includes the fact that the law called the Digital Services Act is intended to address social media’s societal harms, and bad actors access private data from social media platforms to manipulate opinions."
"Opponents argue that the USA is not a good country to live in. They present several claims to support their argument. Firstly, the USA has unfair health and education policies. Evidence shows that many adults struggle to afford healthcare costs, with those in lower-income households, Black and Hispanic adults, and uninsured adults being more likely to face difficulty affording healthcare. Additionally, a significant number of children are without health insurance. Secondly, the USA has a problematic political system that is increasingly divisive. Evidence shows that political divisions have intensified over time, with different types of identities becoming 'stacked' on top of people's partisan identities. As a result, the USA is deeply polarized, with divisions running particularly deep due to a powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion. Thirdly, the USA has a negative culture. Evidence suggests that the US has an insane work culture, misuses digital technology, spreads false information, has high sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. The US also has little respect for one another, with most people only concerned about their own social status. Fourthly, the USA has high taxation and a high cost of living. Evidence shows that Americans with lower incomes pay a much higher percentage of their income in taxes than those with higher incomes. Prices of some goods and services have risen substantially, particularly healthcare, childcare, and education, crowding out spending on other categories and leading to financial insecurity for many. Finally, the USA has significant inequality and poverty, with a concentration of wealth among the top 10% of households and rising poverty rates. Evidence also suggests that the USA is unsafe due to its high rate of gun-related deaths and mass shootings. Lastly, the USA is xenophobic and racist, with high levels of deportations and hate crimes towards Asian Americans, as well as systemic racism in the labor market."
"The proponents argue that the USA is a good country to live in, supported by seven claims. Firstly, the US has a good economy and high standard of living, with a per capita income of $56,300 in 2015, high employment rate, and being the largest national economy and global trader. Secondly, the US has good health and education systems, including a high rate of preventive measures, a leading position in medical research and innovation, and the world's best cancer survival rates. Thirdly, the US has great environment/nature, with diverse landscapes and wildlife and numerous protected areas, such as Yosemite. Fourthly, the US has freedoms/democratic rights, as guaranteed by the American Declaration of Independence and the Inter-American Democratic Charter. Fifthly, the US has great people/culture, being one of the most culturally diverse countries, with English language and American culture influencing the world. Sixthly, the US is a powerful country, being the world's most dominant economic and military power and a leader in the global order. Finally, the US offers great opportunities for individuals, with numerous job vacancies, career opportunities, and potential for personal growth."
"The opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy argue that celibacy allows priests to focus on God, as evidenced by Paul VI's teachings on the choice of a closer relationship with Christ, the increased spiritual solitude, and the special gift of dedicating oneself to God. Celibacy is also a strong religious belief, as demonstrated by its high esteem from the Church's beginnings, its codification in canon law, and its popularity among religious communities. Additionally, celibacy makes priests appear holy, as shown in the Council of Carthage's decrees on continence and chastity. The opponents argue that priests choose to be celibate as Paul favored celibacy as a gift. Finally, they argue that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, citing many religious in the Church who value celibacy and early Church statements on sexual continence and celibacy. Moreover, abandoning celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, as evidenced by the report by the Catholic church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia and the Archbishop of Vienna's statement."
"The debate topic is whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned or not. The positive supporters argue that celibacy should be abandoned because it is outdated, too pressuring and difficult, unhealthy and unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behavior, and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. The evidence supporting these claims includes historical evidence of shaky mandatory priestly celibacy, hardship endured by nuns, suppression of urges or hiding of sexual behavior warping people, the violation of Biblical teachings, the conflict between priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy, celibacy being an abnormal state and unnatural act in nature, allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic priests, priestly celibacy being a contributing factor to sex abuse scandals, and the refusal of some to be ordained as priests due to the vow of celibacy. Therefore, the supporters argue that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned in order to modernize the church and increase the number of priests."
"The opponents of abandoning marriage argue that there are several reasons why we should not abandon it. Firstly, marriage benefits children by providing financial support, social interaction, and stability to the family. Research has shown that children raised in intact married families tend to do better academically, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be abused, use drugs or commit delinquent behavior, and have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married. Secondly, marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons. Throughout history, governments have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Marriage is also a spiritual and emotional union that mirrors the one between God and His Church. Thirdly, marriage makes people happy. Research has shown that married people are happier than unmarried ones, and the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived. Fourthly, marriage makes the couple closer by creating a sense of trust and satisfaction in the relationship. Finally, marriage provides important financial benefits such as income splitting, tax-free transfer of money and assets, and tax deductions for health insurance premiums."
"The supporters of the idea to abandon marriage argue that there are several reasons to do so. Firstly, marriage preserves harmful norms that discriminate against women. For example, in Zimbabwe, many girls are forced into marriage to preserve their family's honor. Additionally, unmarried women tend to be happier, healthier, and live longer than married women. Secondly, marriages are often unstable and result in divorce due to factors such as different expectations within the marriage and high levels of strain caused by children and finances. Thirdly, marriages tie people up with unfair obligations, such as laws in Qatar that require women to have male guardian permission to marry and permission to work or travel. Finally, most of the advantages of marriage can be achieved through a monogamous relationship, which fosters emotional intimacy and reduces the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, abandoning marriage would lead to greater freedom and equality for individuals, especially women."
"The opponents of abandoning school uniforms put forth several claims and supporting evidence. Firstly, they argue that children can still express themselves using other means such as buttons or jewelry, as evidenced by a former student at Hershey High School and research by Andrea Dashiell. Secondly, school uniform reduces bullying as per the Department of Education's findings and a study commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award. Thirdly, school uniforms create a sense of equality and unity, as demonstrated by the Texas survey and B.R. International Public School. Fourthly, school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning, as noted by Natasha Irshad and the Schoolwear Association's 2018 focus group study. Finally, school uniforms save costs, as per a national survey of US school leaders and a UK study. Overall, the opponents of abandoning school uniforms argue that uniforms have several benefits and are an important aspect of the school community."
"The debate is centered on the proposition that we should abandon the use of school uniforms. The positive supporters have put forward several arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that school uniform harms learning and creativity. The proponents of this argument cite evidence that suggests that school uniforms are often imposed based on false beliefs that conformity is important and creativity is not. Additionally, strict dress codes infringe on students' self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity. 

Secondly, the supporters argue that school uniform is harming the student's self-expression. The evidence cited to support this argument is that school uniforms undermine the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and expression. Moreover, one study carried out at Arizona State University found that students from schools without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms. 

Thirdly, the supporters argue that school uniforms are expensive. They provide evidence that suggests that expensive uniforms can be viewed as a financial burden that disproportionately affects students from low-income households. Research has also shown that parents actually end up spending more money on clothes when uniforms are required, and many parents think school uniforms cost too much. 

Fourthly, the supporters argue that school uniforms are often uncomfortable and sexist. They cite evidence that suggests that many types of clothes popular among female students are considered to be “sexually suggestive.” Moreover, girls are often forced to wear uniforms that stop them from being active during breaks or cycling to school. 

Lastly, the supporters argue that school uniforms increase conformity and harm individuality. The proponents of this argument provide evidence that suggests that forced conformity may leave students ill-prepared to enter the adult world where appearance matters even if uniforms are not required. Uniforms only reinforce the notion that authority and obedience matter most, which does not factor into dressing appropriately for a job in an adult career field."
"The opponents of abolishing capital punishment argue that it serves a purpose in providing closure and justice for victims' families and loved ones. Supporters of the death penalty also claim that it is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, and it prevents crimes by serving as a deterrent. They argue that it sends a message to potential criminals that they could face the death penalty if they commit heinous crimes. Furthermore, studies have shown that capital punishment has a deterrent effect, saving lives and reducing murder rates. However, no evidence is presented for the third claim that the death penalty prevents crimes."
"The supporters of abolishing capital punishment argue that it is fundamentally wrong for the state to sanction killing, as it is an ultimate denial of human rights. There is also a risk of executing an innocent person, and the death penalty is often applied unfairly, with people of color being more likely to be executed. Furthermore, the death penalty harms the disenfranchised and is a waste of taxpayer funds with no public safety benefit. Additionally, the death penalty is irreversible, and studies do not show that it is a deterrent to crime. Therefore, it is time to abolish the death penalty."
"The opponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that it is essential to incentivize creativity and innovation, as evidenced by the fact that the protection of IP facilitates and encourages the disclosure of innovation for the common good. Moreover, without a significant period of legal protection, valuable books and artworks would not be created. IP rights also incentivize investment in developing new products, as IP policy is an increasingly important tool for stimulating economic growth, and many types of intangible assets would be under-produced without such protection. IP rights also protect against stealing and provide financial incentives for the creation of investment in intellectual property, generating more value-added per employee than non-IP-intensive industries. Therefore, people or businesses should be able to own their innovations and be compensated for their endeavor."
"The supporters of abolishing intellectual property rights make several arguments. First, they claim that intellectual property prevents the continuous improvement of a service/product. Evidence supporting this claim includes Murray Rothbard's argument that intellectual property laws can hinder innovation, Stallman's argument that the term intellectual property is designed to confuse people, and the free culture movement's view that intellectual monopolies harm progress and benefit concentrated interests. Second, they argue that intellectual property restricts access to important information/products. Evidence supporting this claim includes the increased duration and scope of copyrights and the concern that users who upload copyrighted content could be held criminally liable. Third, they argue that intellectual property rights are unfair. Evidence supporting this claim includes the view that the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is against the interests of developing countries and poor patients, and arguments by Hettinger and Long that intellectual property is not justifiable. Fourth, they claim that intellectual property rights harm creativity/innovation. Evidence supporting this claim includes the assertion by Petra Moser that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may discourage innovation. Fifth, they argue that intellectual property rights waste money, as evidenced by Bhagwati's assertion that protecting intellectual property is simply a matter of royalty collection. Finally, they argue that intellectual property rights are ineffective, as evidenced by arguments that copyright is invalid and that intellectual property rights can only be implemented by limiting physical property rights."
The opponents of the topic 
"The topic of the debate is whether we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. Supporters argue that banning guns would save lives, as evidenced by studies showing that states with higher gun ownership levels have higher rates of homicide and assaults with a firearm. They also argue that gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence, and that guns can fall into the wrong hands, leading to theft and illegal possession. Finally, they argue that guns lead to accidental deaths, particularly among children and adolescents, and that victims of unintentional shootings are three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm."
"The opponents of adopting an austerity regime argue that it should not be implemented for several reasons. Firstly, austerity cuts access to essential services, such as welfare for children and families, which has already faced a 44% decrease in public expenditure cuts. Youth centers and outreach services that help prevent children from becoming "
"The debate topic is whether we should adopt an austerity regime. The positive supporters of this regime present five claims. Firstly, they argue that austerity improves economic measures, citing evidence such as the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia, the potential for higher bond yields if budget deficits are not cut, and the benefits of "
"The opponents of adopting atheism present three main claims. Firstly, they argue that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. This claim is supported by various examples such as John Locke's belief that atheism undermines social order and a boycott of a film by Donohue, who believed that it promotes atheism and denigrates Christianity. Secondly, they argue that atheism lacks morality, and belief in God is necessary for individuals to lead a morally responsible life. This claim is supported by Douglas Wilson's argument that atheists can behave morally but cannot give a coherent account of why they are obligated to do so. Lastly, they argue that people should choose for themselves whether to adopt atheism or not, as it is a personal choice that should not be forced upon individuals. This claim is supported by various pieces of evidence, such as the European Court of Human Rights finding that people cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behavior associated with a particular religion and the freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs, subject to certain limitations prescribed by law."
"The supporters of adopting atheism argue that it is beneficial for individuals, as atheists have a superior basis for ethics and are free from conflicting ideologies and gory details of religious beliefs. Moreover, they believe in scientific explanations and are satisfied with their clear concepts. They should adopt atheism since it cannot be proved that God exists and there is no evidence to justify the belief in God. In addition, religions are immoral and people should not follow them since they are based on lies and set unrealistic expectations, and some religions even teach people to do horrible things. Science can adequately explain the universe, and atheists are more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths."
"The opponents of adopting libertarianism argue that it has negative impacts on economic growth, minorities, justice, and government services. Firstly, they provide evidence that laws and regulations resulting from poor policymaking practices suppress economic growth, resulting in increased inequality. Secondly, they argue that libertarianism allows consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, prioritizes the liberty of the rich over the poor, and requires an endorsement of equality in the distribution of goods and resources. Thirdly, they argue that libertarianism ignores the importance of social cooperation, can lead to unjust outcomes, and can result in unequal outcomes. Fourthly, they claim that libertarianism rejects regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions and environmental degradation, making it difficult to deal with these issues. Finally, they argue that the government is essential in protecting basic human rights, protecting the environment, and providing government services."
"The debate is about whether we should adopt libertarianism or not. Those in support of adopting libertarianism argue that it increases economic growth, political freedom, happiness/fulfillment, and individual freedom/liberties. Evidence supporting these claims includes the coalescence of libertarianism and green politics, advocacy for free-market roads and reduced taxation, higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth in countries with lower levels of government intervention, promotion of competition and innovation, guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, freedom of speech and expression, the ability to pursue individual interests and goals, and the rejection of alternatives to self-ownership. Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters, believing that it is the central goal of political systems."
"The opponents of the ban on human cloning have presented various arguments to support their stance. They argue that cloning has several benefits, such as organ replication, customized organ creation, improvement of quality of life for people with certain medical conditions, reduction of animal testing in medical research, advancement of medical research in different areas, and helping those who cannot have a child due to infertility. They also claim that cloning promotes health, science/research, and can be used to produce genetically modified organisms. Therefore, they believe that banning human cloning would have negative consequences and limit the potential benefits that cloning can offer."
"The debate topic is about whether human cloning should be banned. The positive supporters of the ban argue that cloning is not yet understood enough, which could lead to manufacturing and enslavement of monsters, and even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic. They claim that a society that tolerates cloning has forgotten how to shudder, which always rationalizes away the abominable. Additionally, cloning is unethical and anti-religious since it violates human dignity, which can have adverse consequences for the cloned person, and allowing research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos. Furthermore, cloning is unnatural since it disrupts the familial order and removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship. Lastly, cloning is unsafe since it can result in genetic mutations, unintended epigenetic changes, and premature death, which can cause long-term health problems and reduced lifespan."
"The opponents of banning private military companies argue that there are several benefits to hiring them. Firstly, using private military companies can result in cost savings for the government compared to using traditional military personnel. This is supported by a report by the Congressional Research Service in 2009 and a study published in the journal Defense and Security Analysis in 2011. Secondly, private military companies are often better trained and equipped than traditional military personnel, providing more efficient and effective services. This is supported by several reports and studies, including those by the Heritage Foundation, the RAND Corporation, and the Congressional Research Service. Thirdly, private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies cannot or do not want to do, such as providing security in hostile environments or carrying out covert operations. Finally, using private military companies can increase safety by providing access to specialized skills and expertise and reducing the overall cost of military operations. Overall, the opponents of banning private military companies argue that they provide a valuable resource to the government and should not be banned."
"The debate topic is about whether private military companies should be banned or not. Those who support the ban argue that private military companies are unethical and violate human rights, not professional, cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country, prioritize profit over other considerations, and can encourage or prolong conflict. To support their claims, they cite several pieces of evidence, including reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Congressional Research Service, and the United Nations. The evidence includes examples of criminal activities, unlawful killings, the use of child soldiers, mistreatment of civilians, and other human rights abuses. The evidence also suggests that private military companies can face a conflict of interest when serving both their clients and broader society, potentially leading to ethical violations and decreased professionalism. Additionally, the evidence suggests that private military companies can prioritize profit over other considerations, including ethical and legal considerations, potentially encouraging or prolonging conflicts. Overall, supporters of the ban argue that private military companies pose a threat to human rights, democracy, and international peace and security, and should be banned to ensure accountability and professionalism in the military sector."
"The topic is whether we should ban the use of child actors, and opponents argue against this proposition. They put forward five main claims to support their stance. Firstly, acting may be the child's dream, and studies have shown that some children and young people have a natural talent for acting. Secondly, child performers achieve success and confidence, as evidenced by Ashwin Chitale winning the best child artist award. Thirdly, child performers are necessary for certain roles, which can increase diversity in casting and provide opportunities for more actors, including children. Fourthly, child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation, and there are already child labor laws in place to protect them. Finally, parents should decide for their child as they have a deep understanding of their children's needs and abilities, and are best equipped to make decisions on their behalf."
"The debate is centered around whether or not the use of child actors should be banned. The positive supporters argue that the use of child actors should be banned because it is harmful to their education and development, puts them at risk of exploitation, robs them of their childhood, causes high levels of pressure and stress, and often leads to problems later in life. The evidence presented includes studies, reports, and real-life examples of child actors who have struggled with the negative effects of their work. These negative effects include developmental delays, emotional difficulties, social isolation, burnout, high levels of stress and pressure, physical and emotional abuse, lack of free time and childhood experiences, mental health issues, and difficulties adapting to adult life."
"The opponents of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp argue that it would harm national security. They present evidence that the remaining detainee population consists of hardened and unrepentant terrorists who pose a risk to national security if transferred to another country. They also point out that a significant percentage of former detainees who have been transferred to other countries are confirmed or suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. Additionally, they argue that the facility is state-of-the-art and provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and provides medical care not available to a majority of the population of the world. They also argue that Guantanamo Bay is essential to gain intelligence on Al Qaeda, including how they recruit, train, equip, finance, and conduct operations. The facility is a secure location away from population centers and provides maximum security required to prevent escape. The Guantanamo Bay detention facility is considered by some as the single greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror. Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility."
"The supporters of closing Guantanamo Bay detention camp have several claims. Firstly, detainees have the right to trial in US courts as ruled by the US Supreme Court in the case of Boumediene v. Bush. Secondly, the camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions and serves as a symbol of discrimination/injustice, as it has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression. Thirdly, it is expensive to maintain, costing the US more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago. Fourthly, personnel at the camp have committed crimes against the prisoners, such as sexual humiliation, waterboarding, and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees. Lastly, unjust treatment/tactics are used at the camp, such as the CSRT applying a broad definition of enemy combatant, which inevitably ensnares innocent people, disabling prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence, and relying on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely."
"The opponents of ending affirmative action put forward three main arguments. Firstly, they argue that affirmative action boosts diversity. Hampshire College president, Ed Wingenbach, argues that diversity matters greatly in institutions that predominantly serve White people. Secondly, affirmative action is necessary to compensate for past discrimination. Historian Roger Wilkins notes that Black people have a long history of discrimination and persecution, and affirmative action is a means to address this historical reality. Thirdly, affirmative action reduces discrimination. It can help to bridge inequalities in employment and education, increase access to opportunities, and correct imbalances in representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories. Overall, the opponents of ending affirmative action argue that it is a necessary policy to promote diversity, address past discrimination, and reduce current discrimination."
"The debate topic is whether affirmative action should be ended. Those who support the idea argue that affirmative action should be ended for several reasons. Firstly, affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities and encourages racism against whites. For instance, it can devalue the accomplishments of those who belong to the groups it is intended to help, and this makes it counterproductive. Secondly, affirmative action is ineffective and fails to achieve its intended goals. The evidence suggests that it promotes the upward mobility of privileged African Americans but leaves the less skilled and less educated African Americans behind. Thirdly, affirmative action is not just and only puts a Band-Aid on systematic issues. It's a performative activism that does not focus on ensuring marginalized communities get equal opportunities. Fourthly, affirmative action perpetuates prejudice. Those who oppose the idea contend that it is 'reverse discrimination' and has undesirable side effects. Finally, affirmative action reduces quality. The evidence indicates that programs such as affirmative action and minimum wage laws, which were set up to help minorities, have been harmful to them and stifled their ability to advance in society. In addition, just because BIPOC students are getting into universities does not mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed. Therefore, the supporters argue that affirmative action should be ended."
"The opponents of ending mandatory retirement argue that it creates opportunities for other workers and benefits those who are about to be retired. Mandatory retirement age can create job openings for younger workers and provide them with opportunities for career advancement and experience. Several studies have found that mandatory retirement ages can encourage older workers to retire and free up job opportunities for younger workers, thus promoting intergenerational equity and stimulating economic growth. Additionally, mandatory retirement age can increase financial security for workers as they can receive pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a specified age."
"The debate topic is whether or not mandatory retirement should be ended. Those in favor of ending mandatory retirement argue that it reduces institutional knowledge and harms the economy. Mandatory retirement is also seen as unfair and discriminatory, as it disregards individual circumstances and can result in age discrimination. Those forced to retire often experience a reduced quality of life. The argument is made that everyone should be allowed to retire when they are ready, as it promotes well-being, financial security, and intergenerational collaboration. Evidence supporting these claims includes reports from the OECD, ILO, NBER, World Economic Forum, and AARP, as well as studies on physical and cognitive function, social connections and loneliness, and psychological well-being. Overall, the argument is that mandatory retirement is outdated and should be replaced with a more flexible approach that allows people to retire when they feel ready."
"As opponents of the statement that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons, they argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. They claim that deterrence has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years. The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as Ukraine was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. Countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. They further argue that the possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them, and the West does not intervene in Ukraine while Moscow spares their territory."
"The supporters argue that nuclear weapons should be abolished because they can fall into the wrong hands, as there are materials that terrorists could use to create bombs spread across the world, and there is a possibility of theft, loss, or hacking. They also argue that nuclear weapons provoke or escalate disastrous military actions, as a nuclear attack could result in the deaths of millions of people, and simulations have shown that even a single nuclear warning shot could cause significant damage. The supporters cite historical events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and recent incidents of lost contact with missiles as evidence of the dangers of nuclear weapons."
"The opponents of the proposition that 'We should fight urbanization' argue that urbanization offers more opportunities, benefits the economy, and benefits the environment. They provide evidence to support each claim, such as deficient urban planning and poverty being ongoing problems in cities, but cities providing potential for sustainability and resource efficiency. They also argue that urbanization drives economic growth, as seen in Manchester during the Industrial Revolution, and that it benefits the environment through biodiversity and innovation in green technologies. While there may be challenges and negative consequences of urbanization, the opponents believe that fighting it entirely would mean missing out on the potential benefits it can offer."
"The debate is about whether or not we should fight urbanization. Those in favor of fighting urbanization argue that it has negative consequences. First, restrictions on migration would benefit people in rural areas economically and socially. Evidence shows that agrarian production has decreased due to the combination of economic decline and increased urbanization, which has left rural areas neglected and abandoned. Second, urbanization causes crime. Evidence shows that there is a shortage of housing and jobs, and an increase in urban crime, poverty, and health problems in urban areas. Third, urbanization harms the environment. Evidence shows that it largely contributes to sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers, pollutes clean water supplies, and degrades the marine environment. Fourth, urbanization is causing a strain on cities' resources, such as roads, drainage, garbage, and sanitation. Evidence shows that there is an increased risk of diagnosed psychosis for people living in the most urbanized environments, inadequate housing, the absence of mass sanitary facilities, and the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odors, disease, and high mortality in large urban groups."
"The opponents of compulsory voting present four main claims. First, abstaining from voting is also a way of exercising one's right to vote, as it indicates ambivalence or disagreement with the available options. Second, citizens have the right not to vote, and mandatory voting violates their freedom of speech and civil liberties. Third, compulsory voting can lead to uninformed or random voting, as people may feel compelled to vote without being adequately informed about the issues or candidates. This can also lead to the use of sensational and misleading advertising by politicians. Finally, not everyone has the ability to go and vote, and some people may be voting based on intentional disinformation."
"The topic under discussion is whether or not to introduce compulsory voting. The supporters of the idea present three main arguments in its favor. Firstly, they claim that compulsory voting would increase representation. This is supported by evidence such as a 2016 study that found that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement, and a Swiss canton study that found compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda. Additionally, compulsory voting means that candidates would have to address the needs of all voters and would prevent skewing of the political system towards the well-off and well-educated.

Secondly, supporters argue that compulsory voting would cause more people to become interested in politics. Evidence in support of this includes the fact that compulsory voting has been in place in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory since 1977, and concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission. Compulsory registration and voting would also increase the legitimacy of elected representatives and increase the political education of the people.

Finally, supporters argue that people have an obligation to vote. Evidence supporting this argument includes the fact that compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, and that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms according to the European Court of Human Rights. Opponents of compulsory voting argue that people should have the freedom not to vote, but supporters counter that abstaining is still possible through the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper.

In conclusion, supporters of compulsory voting argue that it would increase representation, generate interest in politics, and fulfill people's obligation to vote."
"The opponents of legalizing cannabis put forward several arguments. Firstly, they claim that cannabis harms the body and provide various pieces of evidence to support this claim. They refer to Dutch research that suggests an increase in THC content leads to impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among inexperienced smokers. They also cite a study that found heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Additionally, they mention a British Lung Foundation study that shows smoking three cannabis joints can cause the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes.

Secondly, opponents argue that legalizing cannabis will increase lack-of-judgment and accidents. They point to several studies that suggest acute cannabis use increases the risk of automobile crashes. They also refer to a new study that found deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades.

Thirdly, they argue that cannabis is a gateway drug and addictive. They mention a study that examined how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study found that THC alters the opioid system, which lessens the effects of opiates on the brain and thus causes rats to use more heroin. They also cite claims that increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs.

Fourthly, opponents claim that legal cannabis can get into the hands of underage teenagers/children. They mention a survey that reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain, despite more than $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005. They also refer to Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s, which led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally.

Finally, they argue that legalizing cannabis will boost the black-market and criminal activity. They mention several illegal cannabis busts that took place in California despite the state legalizing the drug for medical use in 1996 and recreational use in 2016."
"The supporters of legalizing cannabis argue that it should be legalized for several reasons. Firstly, they claim that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful yet remain legal. They point to evidence that shows that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco. Secondly, they argue that legalizing cannabis would be financially beneficial as it could generate billions in tax revenues and save government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Thirdly, supporters argue that cannabis is safe, healthy, and provides pain relief. They cite studies that show there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans. Fourthly, they argue that if cannabis was legalized, it could be regulated, leading to a decrease in black-market/criminal activity. Fifthly, supporters argue that people should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies, citing the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill. In summary, supporters of legalizing cannabis argue that it would be financially beneficial, safe, and provide pain relief while reducing black-market/criminal activity and allowing individuals to exercise their own autonomy."
"The opponents of legalizing prostitution argue that it will have negative consequences in different aspects. Firstly, legalizing prostitution will increase the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. A study conducted in Athens found that a significant percentage of registered prostitutes were HIV positive, and prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population in developing countries. Secondly, legalizing prostitution will increase immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking. Legalization of prostitution would result in an increase in human trafficking and crime, and many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps. Furthermore, sex trafficking is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking, and a large number of prostitutes are being forced to work and being abused by pimps and criminal gangs. Thirdly, legalizing prostitution will increase violence against women. The general consensus among most studies is that rates of physical violence against prostitutes are extremely high, particularly among female sex workers, who experience higher rates of physical violence than their male counterparts. Lastly, selling one's body is immoral, as prostitution is seen as a form of male dominance over women, reducing women to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client. Therefore, opponents argue that legalizing prostitution should not be pursued."
"The supporters of legalizing prostitution argue that it should be legalized because it will boost the economy, increase sex workers' benefits such as health care and safe sex, allow regulation of those in the profession, make the profession safer for women, and that sex work is a valid choice over one's body. They provide evidence that shows that brothels can be functional and generate revenue for cities, that sex workers demand better working conditions and the right to pay taxes, and that decriminalization or legalization would allow sex workers to be treated the same as any other self-employed person. Additionally, studies show that regulation and decriminalization can make the profession safer for women and reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Lastly, supporters argue that prostitution is not inherently bad and should be viewed as a profession, so long as it is a consensual decision made by the individual."
"The opponents of legalizing sex selection put forward several arguments. Firstly, they believe that sex selection can lead to gender imbalance. This is supported by evidence showing that a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars. Moreover, it is suggested that the rise in sex selection reflects the persistent low status of women and girls and has a damaging effect on societies. 

Secondly, the opponents argue that sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases. This is supported by evidence showing that girls have become unwanted in countries like China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son. Additionally, the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology has allowed prenatal discrimination to spread, contributing to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex. 

Thirdly, the opponents argue that sex selection will create abortions and infanticide. This is supported by evidence showing that parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child, and compulsory measures such as the one-child policy in China have resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide. Moreover, although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions. 

Overall, opponents of legalizing sex selection argue that it has several negative consequences and is not a solution to any existing problems."
"The debate is focused on the legalization of sex selection and its positive supporters argue that it should be legal. The first argument in favor of sex selection is that it is within the freedom of parents to select the sex of their child. This can be fulfilled with gender selection, which can help in instilling gender balance in the family and allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The second argument is that sex selection allows for better family planning, as parents can raise the number of children they want, and it gives them effective control over the number of children they want. This can also help couples to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire. The third argument is that sex selection makes the family more happy and complete, as it can be a comforting option for parents who have lost a child and can make the family happier by fulfilling their desire for a specific gender. The fourth argument is that sex selection can prevent diseases in the child through preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection. Finally, sex selection can prevent abortions and infanticide, as it can fulfill the desire of parents for a specific gender and prevent the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies. Therefore, the supporters argue that sex selection should be legalized as it offers numerous benefits to parents and the family."
"The opponents of prohibiting flag burning argue that it is an effective tool of expression, protest, and critique, protected under the First Amendment. They provide evidence to support their claims, including the landmark case of Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, which recognized the right to engage in symbolic speech through armbands as protected under the First Amendment. Similarly, the case of Texas v. Johnson found that burning the American flag was also protected under the First Amendment. They argue that flag burning is justified as a form of free expression and that the government should not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive or disagreeable. Therefore, the opponents of prohibiting flag burning believe that it should remain protected under the First Amendment."
"The topic of the debate is whether we should prohibit flag burning. The positive supporters argue for the prohibition of flag burning by presenting two claims. The first claim is that flags are important symbols that should be respected, supported by evidence such as laws in Turkey and Austria that forbid flag burning, and the argument that new physical fitness standards in the military should be gender-free to assess the capability of soldiers for specific roles. The second claim is that flag burning is an inflammatory act, supported by evidence that burning flags is an offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed and that it is used to antagonize others. Overall, the positive supporters argue that prohibiting flag burning is necessary to show respect for important symbols and prevent inflammatory acts."
"The opponents of the proposition that women should be prohibited in combat put forward several arguments. They assert that gender equality is a human right and that it helps prevent violence against women and girls. Women's impact is not limited to individual companies and organizations as increasing women's participation in the economy is good for the economy. They also argue that women are an asset in combat and can bring unique skills and strategies, such as their ability to communicate, their strong memory, and their resilience to psychological effects. Women are just as capable as men in combat, and history has shown that women have proudly served in the military. Moreover, women should be allowed to serve in combat if they choose to and as long as they pass the tests, just like men. The opponents conclude that if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team, and it is a matter of individual assessment."
"The debate revolves around the topic of prohibiting women in combat. The positive supporters of this idea believe that men are better suited to combat roles than women, and there are several reasons behind it. Firstly, women are physically smaller than men, have less bone mass, less muscle density, and have a harder time achieving and sustaining high levels of fitness. This makes it difficult for them to carry heavy loads and meet the fitness standards required in combat. Secondly, women cannot overcome physical, emotional, or mental barriers that arise during sustained combat, and their inclusion can harm the quality of the military. Thirdly, mixed-gender teams can create distractions and foster petty rivalries, thus impacting unit morale and operational effectiveness. Fourthly, women should serve in safer roles, and there are many other non-combat roles in the military that women can perform efficiently. Finally, women soldier capture is a big concern, and history shows that female soldiers captured in wars have been subjected to rape. Overall, prohibiting women in combat would be the right decision as it would ensure that the military is functioning at its optimal level without any distractions or harm to its quality."
"The opponents of subsidizing journalism put forward three main arguments. Firstly, they argue that government intervention has the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. They provide evidence to support this claim, such as the fact that increased governmental control of journalists' media access freedom of expression can lead to the need for finding new and less controlled ways of expression. They also point out that political endorsements can create more opportunities to construe favoritism in reporting, and can create a perceived conflict of interest. Furthermore, opponents argue that freedom of the press has to include freedom for the press to fail.

Secondly, opponents argue that it is preferable to spend the money elsewhere. They argue that federal subsidies would decide winners and losers, protecting inefficient companies and creating huge obstacles for entrepreneurs. The opponents argue that the precedent of postal subsidies from our nation's early founding is irrelevant since we had one communication medium then, newspapers. In today's world of multiple forms of print, broadcast, and digital communication, federal subsidies would be problematic.

Lastly, opponents argue that journalism is like every other business and if it is not sustainable, it should fail. They point out that the federal government can't afford to bail out newspapers, as it has already bailed out undeserving banks and automobile manufacturers and is trying to figure out how to fix our healthcare system. Taxpayers cannot afford to bail out undeserving media companies, and journalism cannot afford to be dependent on a debt-burdened government."
"The debate topic is about whether we should subsidize journalism. The positive supporters of this proposition argue that subsidies are crucial for making journalism viable, as journalism plays an important role in spreading information and ensuring accountability. Additionally, subsidies can increase the quality of journalism and promote media-pluralism. To support these claims, the supporters present evidence such as the European Court of Human Rights recognizing the importance of journalistic sources, the significance of traditional media for maintaining community quality of life, the impact of national media on governmental authority, and the importance of mainstream media in social media conversations. Furthermore, subsidies can help in empowering the public by educating them on how media works. Lastly, peace journalism may help to expose violent groups by presenting anomalous local perspectives. Overall, subsidies can help increase objectivity in reporting and ensure that journalism remains a fundamental pillar of democracy."
"The opponents of subsidizing space exploration have presented several arguments. Firstly, they argue that space exploration can be carried out by the private sector, as evidenced by successful ventures by companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic. Secondly, they argue that space exploration is expensive, with costs ranging from $10,000 to $700 million per launch, and there are significant R&D costs as well as costs associated with assembling and maintaining the spacecraft. Thirdly, they argue that space exploration is ineffective and scientifically useless, with the exception of satellite technology, which has had a beneficial effect on our world. Lastly, they contend that there are issues more important to fund than space exploration, such as poverty, global warming, reducing crime rates, and finding cures for diseases. Therefore, they believe that government subsidies for space exploration should be discontinued."
"The topic of the debate is 'We should subsidize space exploration'. The positive supporters have presented several arguments to support their stance. Firstly, space exploration can help colonize the resources and lands of other planets, thereby providing clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century and creating new homelands for the human species. It could also expand the ecological niche to include the solar system, making the human species less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe. Secondly, space exploration improves science and technology, acting as a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies and research in basic sciences. The space age also provides technologies, challenges, motivation, and even optimism to attack tasks with confidence. Thirdly, space exploration is financially beneficial, as dollars spent on it can create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. It also generates revenue of more than $1 trillion in 2040, up from $350 billion currently. Fourthly, space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity, as innovations from it can help save the planet and humanity and lead to a more sustainable world. Finally, space exploration unravels information about the universe, including the formation and evolution of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems. Therefore, we should subsidize space exploration to benefit humanity and ensure our survival in the future."
"In the debate over whether we should subsidize vocational education, opponents argue against the idea. They put forth several claims and pieces of evidence to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes, such as early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education. They cite various reports and studies that suggest subsidizing vocational education may not adequately address workforce development needs and may have limited benefits for the economy. Secondly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education is expensive and can compete with other important priorities for funding and resources. They cite reports and studies that suggest vocational education programs can require significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty, and rely on limited funding sources. Thirdly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions. They cite studies that suggest subsidies for vocational education can influence student choice and lead to an increase in enrollment in vocational programs, which may lead to an increase in the number of workers in those fields. Finally, opponents argue that vocational education is not a good career choice. They cite reports and studies that suggest vocational education programs may prepare students for low-wage jobs, offer limited transferability of skills, and provide inadequate support for non-college bound students."
"The debate is focused on the proposition that we should subsidize vocational education. The positive supporters of this claim present four arguments, each of which is supported by evidence. The first argument is that subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources. The evidence for this argument includes studies by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, the National Center for Education Research, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Center for American Progress, and the National Center for Postsecondary Research. All of these studies found that subsidizing vocational education can improve workforce development, increase job opportunities, increase enrollment for underrepresented groups, better align with local labor market needs, and increase economic mobility, particularly for individuals who face barriers to employment.

The second argument presented by the supporters is that vocational education better fits many students. The evidence for this argument includes studies by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, the National Center for Postsecondary Research, the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, and the National Skills Coalition. These studies found that vocational education programs are designed to meet current workforce needs, provide relevant training and education, have lower dropout rates, offer a career-focused curriculum, and offer customized learning experiences tailored to individual needs and interests.

The third argument presented by the supporters is that vocational education is a good career choice. The evidence for this argument includes studies by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, the National Skills Coalition, the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, the Institute for College Access and Success, and the National Center for Postsecondary Research. These studies found that vocational education leads to higher earning potential, shorter time to employment, practical and hands-on training, education in in-demand fields, lower student debt, and higher levels of job satisfaction.

The fourth and final argument presented by the supporters is that vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society. The evidence for this argument includes studies by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, the National Skills Coalition, and the National Center for Postsecondary Research. These studies found that investments in vocational education can fill in-demand jobs, contribute to overall economic development, increase opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds, increase the representation of diverse individuals in the workforce, and support local economies.

Overall, the supporters argue that subsidizing vocational education is beneficial for individuals, society, and the economy as a whole. The presented evidence suggests that vocational education can increase job opportunities, lead to higher earning potential, better fit the learning styles and career aspirations of many students, and benefit the entire market and society by filling in-demand jobs, contributing to economic development, and supporting diverse individuals and local economies."
