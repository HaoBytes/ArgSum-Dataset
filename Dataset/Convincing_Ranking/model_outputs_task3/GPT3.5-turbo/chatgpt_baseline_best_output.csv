"The debate is centered around the topic of whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offense. Opponents of this stance argue that assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it and reduces suffering, as evidenced by the campaign group Dignity in Dying. They further argue that people should have the freedom to choose to end their life, as evidenced by plaintiffs who believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death. Additionally, opponents argue that the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide, as evidenced by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative. Overall, the opponents of this stance argue that assisted suicide should not be a criminal offense and should be considered a personal choice."
"The topic for the debate is whether 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence.' Those in support of this stance argue that assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die for their own benefit, violates the doctor's role as a healer, and people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others. Furthermore, people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. The evidence supporting these claims includes the requirements for a patient to be eligible for physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia, the opposition of the New Zealand Medical Association to voluntary euthanasia, and the statement of Dr. Lynda Young that assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as a healer. Additionally, it is argued that assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better and that allowing physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia could lead to non-voluntary euthanasia of vulnerable individuals."
"The debate topic is whether homeschooling should be banned, and opponents argue against it. They have five main claims. The first claim is that homeschooling is often the best option for exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students. The Gallup polls conducted on American voters show that there has been a significant shift in attitude towards homeschooling over the past twenty years. The second claim is that homeschooling can be personalized to the child's pace and needs, whereas mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Many parents opt to homeschool their children due to unhappiness at school. The third claim is that mainstream schools have a lot of violence and bullying, whereas homeschools offer a safer environment for children. The fourth claim is that parents should have the right to choose the education of their children, and many parents prefer homeschooling over local public schools. The fifth claim is that the home is a good learning environment, where children can enjoy a broader socialization and have real opportunities to structure their own days. Overall, opponents argue that homeschooling should not be banned due to the benefits it provides to children and parents."
"The debate topic is whether homeschooling should be banned, and the positive supporters argue in favor of a ban. They present four claims as evidence to support their stance. First, they argue that homeschooling cannot be regulated and standardized, which is essential to ensure that children are not being abused. Public schools, on the other hand, are a social safety net for vulnerable children, providing adequate nutrition and ensuring vaccination requirements. Second, mainstream schools are essential to developing social skills and exposure to community values. Third, mainstream schools offer a higher educational quality due to teachers being required to have education degrees and more experience working with children. Finally, parents are not qualified as teachers and cannot deliver the depth and breadth of learning that children require to meet their potential, which involves a lot of extra work and taking children to external examination centers. Therefore, the positive supporters argue that homeschooling should be banned."
"The topic of the debate is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. The opponents of mandatory vaccinations present three claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that routine child vaccinations or their side effects are dangerous. To support this, they mention the example of Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, which was pulled from the market after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of bowel obstruction. Secondly, opponents of mandatory vaccinations claim that compulsory vaccination contradicts basic rights, including bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, opponents argue that routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy and that natural infection often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations, according to the Mayo Clinic."
"The debate topic is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. The supporters of this stance argue that routine child vaccinations are effective, save lives, necessary to protect others, prevent virus/disease spreading, and prevent children from suffering from preventable diseases. The evidence supporting these claims shows that the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine decreased invasive pneumococcal disease by 69%, the measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%, routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others as shown in the 2012 pertussis outbreak that sickened over 48,000 people, pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness, and vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases such as measles. Therefore, supporters argue that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to ensure the safety and well-being of children and the broader community."
"The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government, and the opponents argue against it. They claim that social media regulation is not effective, citing the lack of enforcement of the European Union's data privacy law as an example. They also argue that regulation harms privacy, as most people feel they have little control over how their personal information is used. Furthermore, they claim that regulation can harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights, citing examples of vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders and distort history. They argue that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, as it can cause disruptions in the market system. Lastly, they claim that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government, citing examples of political advertisements targeting minority communities during elections."
"The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government, and its proponents have put forth several arguments to support the idea. First, they argue that social media regulation is necessary to protect younger audiences from harmful content. Second, they contend that it is necessary to combat the spread of fake news on social media. Third, they assert that social media regulation is beneficial to society at large. Fourth, they claim that it can help to deal with negative content on social media platforms. Finally, they argue that social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users. The evidence provided in support of these claims includes statistics on unauthorized access to online social network accounts, the need for independent, statutory regulators, and the dangers of disinformation and hate speech going unchecked on social media platforms."
"The opponents of the stance that 'The USA is a good country to live in' have presented multiple claims and evidence to support their arguments. Firstly, they argue that the US has unfair health and education policies, citing evidence that 8.1 million children under 18 years old were without health insurance in 2007, with poverty-stricken and Hispanic children being more likely to be uninsured. Secondly, they claim that the US has a problematic and divisive political system, with polarization running deep in the country. Thirdly, they argue that the US has a negative culture, citing a study that suggests living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer. Fourthly, they claim that the US has high taxation and costs of living, with almost half of Americans believing that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security. Fifthly, they argue that the US has inequality and poverty, citing evidence that the country's Gini coefficient was the same as Bulgaria's and Turkey's in 2019. Sixthly, they claim that the US is unsafe, citing a decline in the perception of safety from 38% to 11%. Lastly, they argue that the US is xenophobic and racist, citing an experiment that shows racial discrimination in the labor market."
The supporters of the statement 
"The opponents of the proposition that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned put forward several arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God and dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbor. They also argue that celibacy is a strong religious belief and a privilege of the religious who have taken the vow of celibacy. Moreover, celibacy makes priests be perceived as holy. They further argue that priests choose to be celibate. Lastly, they argue that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, and removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts. However, opponents also concede that celibacy could have contributed to instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church."
"The debate topic is whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned. Supporters of this notion present several arguments to support their stance. First, they argue that celibacy is outdated, as evidenced by the belief of Lakeland that clerical celibacy should become optional and that change is inevitable. Second, they argue that celibacy is too pressuring and difficult, which has led to the suppression of urges and warped behaviour. Elizabeth Abbott, the author of A History of Celibacy, argues that celibacy has failed for thousands of years, bringing out horrible things. Third, supporters claim that celibacy is unhealthy and unnatural, as all living organisms are meant to reproduce, and the sexual act is critical for the survival of the species. Fourth, celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour, as seen in the wake of the clergy sexual abuse scandals, with critics arguing that priestly celibacy was a contributing factor. Finally, celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests, as evidenced by Gerard's complaint that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. Overall, supporters of abandoning the vow of celibacy present several compelling arguments to support their position."
"The opponents of the proposition that we should abandon marriage have put forward five claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that marriage benefits children. Evidence shows that children who are raised in intact married families tend to have better outcomes in terms of education, health, and behavior. They are less likely to suffer abuse or engage in delinquent behavior. Secondly, opponents claim that marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons. Evidence shows that children who are raised in healthy marriages experience lasting benefits and are less likely to suffer from mental and behavioral disorders, criminal activity, and substance abuse. Thirdly, opponents argue that marriage makes people happy. Evidence shows that people who are happy with their lives are more likely to get married. Fourthly, they claim that marriage makes the couple closer. Evidence shows that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting. Finally, opponents claim that marriage provides important financial benefits, such as higher standard deductions and the ability to combine income. Overall, they believe that abandoning marriage would result in the loss of these important benefits."
"The debate topic is about whether we should abandon marriage or not. The positive supporters argue that we should abandon marriage due to several reasons. First, marriage preserves norms that are harmful to women. Evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men, and the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women. Second, marriages are unstable, with around 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s getting divorced within 25 years. Third, marriages tie up people with unfair obligations, particularly women, who were historically and legally subordinate to their husbands. Finally, most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship. Monogamy fosters emotional intimacy, which supports two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. Therefore, the positive supporters believe that abandoning marriage would be a better option."
"The opponents argue that school uniforms should not be abandoned as they provide several benefits. Firstly, claim_1 states that children can still express themselves using other means as fashion is not considered free speech. Secondly, claim_2 argues that school uniform reduces bullying and a survey by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought that a good school uniform could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background. Thirdly, claim_3 asserts that school uniforms create a sense of equality/unity, symbolizing membership of a group while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group. Fourthly, claim_4 suggests that school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning as uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork. Lastly, claim_5 states that school uniforms save costs, with a national survey of 517 US school leaders finding that 94% of those surveyed believe that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel."
"The topic of the debate is whether we should abandon the use of school uniforms. The positive supporters of this argument have presented several claims to support their stance. The first claim is that school uniforms harm learning and creativity. This is supported by the statement of a senior, Alyse Madsen, who stated that strict dress codes infringe on a student's self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.

The second claim is that school uniforms are harming students' self-expression. This is supported by the evidence provided by Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, who states that wearing uniforms allows for a lot of comparison and that students often feel that they don't look their best if they have a different body type.

The third claim is that school uniforms are expensive. The Children's Society conducted research in 2020, which showed that the average spent on school uniforms per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable.

The fourth claim is that school uniforms are often uncomfortable and sexist. A recent GLSEN study found that 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender, and nearly 32 percent of transgender students have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex.

The fifth and final claim is that school uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality. Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. 

Overall, the evidence presented by the positive supporters of the argument to abandon school uniforms suggests that uniforms harm learning and creativity, self-expression, are expensive, uncomfortable/sexist, and increase conformity, or harm individuality."
"The opponents of abolishing capital punishment put forward three main claims. Firstly, they argue that the death penalty helps the victim and their family in finding closure, deterring other criminals and expressing society's moral outrage for the heinous crimes committed. They point to the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, a white supremacist who belonged to the Aryan People's Revolution, as an example of someone who deserved the ultimate punishment. Secondly, they claim that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, although the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights believes that it is contrary to customary international law to impose it on juveniles. Thirdly, they assert that capital punishment prevents crimes by serving as a deterrent, and cite a study by Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd which concludes that each execution results in eighteen fewer murders on average."
"The debate topic is 'We should abolish capital punishment,' and its positive supporters present three main claims. First, state-sanctioned killing is fundamentally wrong. This claim is supported by evidence showing that the death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner, resulting in the execution of innocent people and racial bias in sentencing. Second, the death penalty harms the disenfranchised by diverting resources from other cases and costing taxpayers significantly more money. Third, the death penalty is irreversible, and its deterrent effect is debatable. Evidence indicates that fear of the death penalty may cause some to hesitate, but it is not enough to justify keeping it in force. Therefore, the supporters of abolishing capital punishment argue that it is an outdated and unjust practice that should be abolished."
"The opponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that these rights are necessary to incentivize creativity and innovation, as well as investment in developing new products. They provide evidence such as the positive correlation between strengthening IP systems and economic growth in six Asian countries, and the financial incentive provided to owners of intellectual property for their creation and investment. Additionally, they argue that copyright better preserves intellectual property such as movies, music, and television shows, protecting against stealing. Therefore, they believe that people and businesses should own their innovations and be compensated for their endeavors."
"The topic of the debate is whether or not intellectual property rights should be abolished. Those in support of the abolition of intellectual property rights argue that it prevents continuous improvement of a service/product and restricts access to important information/products. They also argue that intellectual property rights are unfair and harm creativity/innovation, waste money, and are ineffective. Critics argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents. Lateef Mtima, director of the Institute for Intellectual Property and Social Justice at Howard University School of Law, expressed concern that users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable themselves. Roderick T. Long argues that the concept of intellectual property is not libertarian and infringes on freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Petra Moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation. Overall, the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies, which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors, may discourage innovation. For getting the protection for the first time, it could be bit expensive particularly if the product is complex and involves methods, designs, and processes. Tucker did not believe in intellectual property rights in the form of patents, on the grounds that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot rightfully be held as property."
"The topic of the debate is whether or not we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. Opponents argue against the abolition of this right, citing multiple reasons. Firstly, they claim that gun control is ineffective. They provide evidence from a Lancet study in 2016 which shows that most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and in some cases, such laws are associated with higher gun death rates. Secondly, opponents argue that gun ownership is a right and an essential component of personal freedom. They provide evidence from a survey which shows that about three-quarters of gun owners consider the right to own guns essential to their sense of freedom. Thirdly, they argue that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports shooting. They cite data from 2016 which shows that over 50% of all hunters participate in target shooting and more than 10 million people use firearms for hunting. Finally, opponents argue that gun ownership promotes self-protection. They provide evidence from a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, which shows that 63% of gun owners cited personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Overall, opponents of the abolition of the right to keep and bear arms argue that gun ownership is a right that promotes personal freedom, sports, and hunting, as well as self-protection."
"The supporters of the proposition that 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms' have presented four claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that banning guns would save lives, citing the example of Missouri, where gun-related killings increased by 25 percent after the repeal of its permit law. Secondly, they assert that gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence. Researchers have found that states with higher gun ownership experience three to five more mass shootings for every 10-unit increase in gun ownership. Thirdly, the proponents argue that guns can fall into the wrong hands, leading to deadly consequences. For instance, the Texas church massacre in 2017 was carried out by a man who should have been barred from buying guns due to his domestic violence conviction. Lastly, the supporters argue that guns lead to accidental deaths. According to a 2001 study, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns."
"The opponents of adopting an austerity regime argue that it should not be implemented due to several reasons. Firstly, it cuts access to essential services, as the unprotected areas such as social security, prisons, local government, and adult education are facing an annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Secondly, austerity extends recessions, as shown by the slow recovery in several European countries due to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates. Thirdly, austerity is unfair to citizens, causing rising inequality and poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements. Fourthly, austerity results in lower growth, as demonstrated by the OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. Lastly, austerity results in lower job creation, as austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation, according to Alessandro Turrini. Therefore, the opponents argue that adopting an austerity regime should be avoided due to the negative impacts it has on essential services, recessions, citizens, growth, and job creation."
"The debate is about whether adopting an austerity regime is a good idea or not. The positive supporters argue that adopting an austerity regime is important for several reasons. Firstly, austerity improves economic measures as research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina showed that spending cuts were often associated with economic expansions. Secondly, austerity is important in the long term as cutting government consumption may raise the default premium in the short run but is necessary to maintain stability. Thirdly, austerity is important to increase stability as it allows for a growth in external demand to compensate for a contraction in internal demand. Fourthly, austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts, which is the plan of Chancellor George Osborne. Lastly, austerity regimes are essential in economically troubled times. A good example of successful austerity is the response of President Warren G. Harding who reduced federal budget and tax rates, which led to a drop in the debt by more than 30%. Overall, adopting an austerity regime is a necessary measure to ensure economic stability and reduce deficits in the long term."
"The debate topic is whether we should adopt atheism. Opponents of this view argue that adopting atheism is problematic for several reasons. Firstly, they claim that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. To support this claim, they provide evidence from the Albanian Constitution of 1976 and the penal code of 1977, which imposed prison sentences for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature. Secondly, opponents argue that atheism lacks morality. They cite Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, who argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life. Lastly, opponents assert that people should be free to choose for themselves whether or not to adopt atheism. They provide evidence from the European Convention on Human Rights, which states that freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."
"The debate topic is whether we should adopt atheism, and its supporters provide four main claims to support their stance. The first claim is that adopting atheism is beneficial to the person who adopts it since atheists do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion. The second claim is that atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists, and Atheist Michael Scriven insists that atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence. The third claim is that religions are immoral and people should not follow them since some religions can be immoral in that they teach people to do horrible things. Lastly, the fourth claim is that science can adequately explain the universe, and Stephen Weinberg, a Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, believes that anything scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization."
"The opponents of adopting libertarianism present several claims and evidence to support their arguments. First, they argue that libertarianism harms economic growth by ignoring market failures and that non-intervention in the economy leads to monopolies, stifled innovation, and economic instability. Second, they claim that libertarianism harms minorities and those who are worse off, as a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises requires endorsing the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Third, they argue that libertarianism is unjust and non-equal as markets can fail to address important social needs and result in unequal outcomes. Fourth, they claim that libertarianism removes essential laws, infrastructure, and government services, leaving no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion. Finally, they assert that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens and has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions."
"The debate topic is whether we should adopt libertarianism, and the positive supporters argue that it should be adopted because it increases economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfillment, and individual freedom/liberties. The first argument in support of libertarianism is that it increases economic growth, and advocates of libertarianism suggest that reduced taxation leads to financial freedom and economic prosperity. The second argument is that libertarianism increases freedom in the political system by protecting property rights, which is essential for ensuring individual freedom. Thirdly, libertarianism promotes greater cooperation, understanding, and social support, leading to happiness and fulfillment. Lastly, libertarianism increases individual freedom and liberties through the principle of self-ownership. Rothbard's defense of self-ownership principle suggests that it is both axiomatic and universal. Therefore, the positive supporters of libertarianism argue that adopting libertarianism is beneficial for society as it brings economic growth, political freedom, happiness, and individual liberties."
"The debate is about whether human cloning should be banned. Opponents argue against the ban of human cloning by stating that cloning can be used for organ replication and to advance medical research in various areas. Cloning can also be used to help people who cannot have a child due to genetic diseases, and it can be used to study the genetic basis of infertility. Additionally, cloning can promote science and research by studying the genetic makeup of extinct species and understanding the processes that led to their extinction. Therefore, banning human cloning could hinder scientific progress and limit medical advancements."
"The debate topic is about banning human cloning. The positive supporters argue that human cloning should be banned based on four main claims. Firstly, cloning is not well understood enough, as it can lead to the dehumanization of children. Secondly, cloning is unethical and goes against religious beliefs. Thirdly, cloning is unnatural and disrupts the familial order. Finally, cloning is unsafe and has the potential for abuse, thus it should only be used for medical purposes. For instance, Germany and France proposed a convention to ban reproductive human cloning in 2001, while the Holy See noted that such a convention would legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning. According to the Council of Europe's 2008 report, there is potential for abuse of cloning technology, and measures should be taken to ensure that cloning is only used for medical purposes."
"The opponents argue that banning private military companies is not a wise decision. Firstly, they argue that hiring private military companies is financially beneficial as they reduce bureaucratic processes and allow for a more streamlined decision-making process. Secondly, private military companies are well-trained and better equipped, and they can quickly respond to changing circumstances, providing the government with a valuable resource in times of crisis. Thirdly, private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies cannot, or do not want, to do, offloading non-core tasks from regular army personnel. Lastly, private military companies increase safety by providing support services such as logistics and communications, freeing up regular army personnel to focus on other tasks. Therefore, the opponents believe that banning private military companies would be detrimental to the military and overall safety."
"The debate topic is whether private military companies should be banned. Those in favor of the ban argue that private military companies are less ethical and are involved in activities that violate human rights and commit crimes. The evidence in support of this claim comes from a 2010 report by the Congressional Research Service which found evidence of unlawful killings committed by private military companies, including the killing of civilians. Additionally, those in favor of the ban argue that private military companies are not professional, with a 2009 Amnesty International report finding that they have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel which leads to increased risk and decreased professionalism in their operations.

The third claim made by supporters of the ban is that private military companies cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country. This claim is supported by a 2007 Human Rights Watch report which found that the lack of transparency surrounding private military companies can lead to actions that are not in the best interest of the hiring country. Additionally, supporters of the ban argue that private military companies are motivated by profit, which often takes priority over other considerations, as found in a 2006 report by the International Peace Institute.

Finally, supporters of the ban argue that private military companies solicit engaging, or prolonging, conflict. The evidence supporting this claim comes from a 2009 Congressional Research Service report which found that the lack of accountability surrounding private military companies can lead to actions that prolong and escalate conflicts. Overall, the argument in favor of banning private military companies is based on their lack of ethics, professionalism, trustworthiness, and their tendency to prioritize profit over other considerations and prolong conflict."
"The topic of the debate is whether or not the use of child actors should be banned. Those who oppose the ban argue that acting may be the child's dream and can contribute to their desire to pursue a career in the performing arts. They also argue that child performers can achieve success and confidence, and that they are necessary for certain roles which can increase audience engagement. Moreover, they argue that child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation, as this would allow the production to obey child labor laws. Finally, they argue that the parents should decide for their child, as they have legal protection for their right to make decisions for their children. The opponents present evidence to support their claims, including a report by the American Psychological Association which found that acting can provide a way for children to express their emotions, a report by the Actors Equity Association which found that casting children in certain roles can make the production more appealing to a wider audience, and a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics which found that parents have legal protection for their right to make decisions for their children."
"The debate topic is whether we should ban the use of child actors. The supporters of the ban present five claims to support their stance. The first claim is that being a performer harms the child's education. A study published in the Journal of Adolescence in 2018 found that child performers may experience long-term negative effects on their personal, professional, and academic lives, leading to difficulties in adulthood. The second claim is that child performers are at risk of exploitation. A study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014 found that child performers may be at risk of human trafficking due to their vulnerability and the lack of oversight in the industry. The third claim is that child performers are losing their childhood. The same study found that child performers may experience a loss of innocence and childhood due to the exposure to adult themes and mature material in the entertainment industry. The fourth claim is that child performers have a lot of pressure. A report by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2016 found that child performers may experience burnout due to high levels of pressure and stress, leading to negative impacts on their mental and physical health. The fifth claim is that child performers tend to develop problems later in life. The evidence supporting this claim is that many child actors face difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls, leading to a lack of identity and problems later in life. Based on these arguments, the supporters of the ban on child actors conclude that it is necessary to prohibit the use of child actors in the entertainment industry."
"The opponents of closing Guantanamo Bay detention camp make three claims. Firstly, they argue that closing the camp would harm national security, with evidence showing that a significant number of former detainees have reengaged in terrorist or insurgent activities after being transferred. Secondly, they claim that the camp is better for prisoners than alternatives, as it provides maximum security, multiple levels of confinement, and medical care. Finally, they argue that the camp is essential to gain intelligence, as key information used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained through enhanced interrogation techniques used on detainees at the camp."
"The debate topic is whether the Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed. Those in favor of closing the camp argue that the detainees have the right to trial in US courts, as the US Supreme Court has ruled. They also argue that the camp harms the US image and institutions, serving as a symbol of discrimination and injustice, which has tarnished America's international reputation. Moreover, the camp is expensive, costing millions of dollars per prisoner, and personnel at the camp have committed crimes against the prisoners, such as physical abuse and torture. Finally, they argue that unjust treatment and tactics are used in the camp, citing examples of brutal treatment endured by Mr. Slahi and corroborated by investigations. All of these reasons support the conclusion that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed."
"The topic of the debate is whether affirmative action should be ended. Opponents of this idea argue that affirmative action is necessary to boost diversity, as evidenced by a brief submitted by the APALC in support of the University of Texas in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. They also argue that affirmative action is necessary to compensate for past discrimination against Black people, as evidenced by historian Roger Wilkins' research on Black history in North America. Lastly, opponents argue that affirmative action reduces discrimination, citing a 2001 case where Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers to counter past discriminatory policies against women and aboriginals."
The debate topic is whether we should end affirmative action or not. The supporters of this topic believe that affirmative action should be ended. The first argument in support of this stance is that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities. The evidence for this argument is that Asian-American students are being marked down on 
"The opponents of ending mandatory retirement argue that there are benefits to having a mandatory retirement age. First, they claim that mandatory retirement creates opportunities for younger workers to enter the workforce and contribute to economic growth. This claim is supported by a 2019 study by the International Monetary Fund which found that mandatory retirement ages can stimulate economic growth. Second, they argue that mandatory retirement benefits those who are about to retire by providing them with increased financial security through pension and retirement benefits at a specified age. This argument is supported by a 2010 report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Therefore, opponents believe that ending mandatory retirement may have negative consequences for both younger workers and those who are approaching retirement."
"The supporters of ending mandatory retirement argue that it should be abolished due to its harmful effects. Firstly, mandatory retirement decreases institutional knowledge which is evident in the airline industry where pilots are forced to retire at a certain age. Secondly, it harms the economy as it limits labor market flexibility, reducing the workforce's ability to adapt to changing economic conditions. Thirdly, mandatory retirement is discriminatory, promoting intergenerational inequity by reducing the diversity of skills and experiences available in the workplace. Fourthly, it reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, causing decreased social connections and increased feelings of loneliness. Finally, they argue that people should be allowed to retire when they are ready, which can reduce the risk of poverty in old age as they can continue to earn an income. Therefore, the supporters believe that mandatory retirement should be abolished to prevent these negative consequences."
"As opponents of the abolition of nuclear weapons, the claim is made that these weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. The evidence supporting this claim is that deterrence has been a strategy used for almost 70 years to prevent certain actions and has been critical in maintaining peace."
"The debate topic is about whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. The supporters of this stance argue that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands, causing a significant threat. They provide evidence that nuclear materials are not going away and that more states are interested in developing them, which could lead to theft or loss of these materials. They also argue that the use of nuclear weapons could escalate a disastrous military action, citing the Cuban missile crisis as an example. They believe that when tensions escalate, it becomes more likely that unfortunate coincidences could lead to big problems, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would survive a similar flare-up in tensions. Therefore, they conclude that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons to prevent these potential threats."
"The proponents of urbanization argue against the statement that 'We should fight urbanization' with three main claims. Firstly, they claim that cities offer more opportunities for better jobs and education, as evidenced by the migration trend in Japan during its economic development. Secondly, urbanization benefits the economy by promoting economic growth, technological advancements, occupational and social mobility, and adaptability. Thirdly, urbanization benefits the environment by driving innovation, including the development of green technologies, which will determine the future of the green economy. Thus, they contend that urbanization should not be fought but rather embraced for its numerous benefits."
"The debate topic is 'We should fight urbanization', and those who support this notion argue for it based on several claims. Firstly, they claim that restrictions on migration would benefit people in rural areas economically and socially. Evidence to support this includes the protection of natural resources, which eliminates income risk and health effects that facilitate rural to urban migration. Secondly, they argue that urbanization causes crime, and evidence shows that the crime rate rose during the period of industrialization, particularly in towns and cities. Thirdly, they argue that urbanization harms the environment, with surveys showing that urbanization and coastal development contribute to increased degradation of the marine environment. Finally, they claim that urbanization strains the resources of cities, with the fast process of urbanization resulting in irregular neighborhoods. Based on these arguments and evidence, the proponents of fighting urbanization suggest that we need to take action to restrict urbanization."
"The opponents of introducing compulsory voting present several claims. Firstly, they argue that abstaining from voting is a way of reflecting one's preferences and that forcing individuals to vote goes against this. The evidence supporting this claim comes from Herbert Spencer, who noted that regardless of whether a person votes or not, they will be deemed to have consented to the winning candidate's rule. Secondly, the opponents argue that citizens have the right not to vote, and compulsory voting would be a fundamental breach of civil liberties. This claim is supported by the stance of right faction leader Minchin in the Liberal Party, who supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system. Thirdly, the opponents claim that compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, which may skew election results. This claim is supported by the argument that people who are uninformed or do not care about the election outcome may end up voting randomly. Finally, opponents claim that not everyone has the ability to go to vote, and some may vote based on intentional disinformation. The evidence supporting this claim comes from a recent poll that showed most Americans don't know basic facts about the Constitution, and some may be voting based on intentional disinformation."
"The topic of the debate is whether or not to introduce compulsory voting. Supporters of the proposition argue that it should be introduced for three main reasons. Firstly, it increases representation, as candidates would have to address the needs of all voters if voting were compulsory. This is in contrast to voluntary voting systems, where less educated and poorer people tend not to vote, skewing the political system towards the well-off and educated. Secondly, compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. By ensuring that candidates win a majority of the people's votes, the legitimacy of elected representatives will be increased. Finally, people have an obligation to vote. This is evidenced by the fact that voter turnout in Thailand is not much of a problem as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the constitution."
"The opponents of legalizing cannabis argue that it harms the body, increases lack of judgment and accidents, is a gateway drug, can get into the hands of underage teenagers, and boosts the black market and criminal activity. They provide evidence to support their claims, such as a recent study by the British Lung Foundation which found that smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes. Researchers also found that the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9% to 21.5% from 2000 to 2018, and that early cannabis smokers were five times more likely to move on to harder drugs. Additionally, the opponents argue that legalizing cannabis can lead to it getting into the hands of underage teenagers and boost the black market and criminal activity, citing examples such as the recent illegal cannabis busts in California."
"The proponents of legalizing cannabis argue that it should be made legal for various reasons. Firstly, they argue that alcohol and tobacco, which are more harmful drugs, remain legal. They argue that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. Secondly, they claim that legalizing cannabis would be financially beneficial. In 1988, a study estimated that California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period as a result of the decriminalization of cannabis. Thirdly, they claim that cannabis is safe, healthy, and can provide pain relief. A group of congressmen pointed out that the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated that cannabis does have medical benefits. Fourthly, they claim that legalizing cannabis could lead to its regulation. Researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control. Fifthly, they argue that legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market and criminal activity. A study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence. Finally, they argue that people should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies. They cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill, who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society."
"The topic of the debate is whether prostitution should be legalized. Those who oppose the legalization of prostitution argue that it will lead to several negative consequences. Firstly, legalization will increase the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, as prostitution can act as a reservoir of STDs within the general population, as evidenced by studies in developing countries such as Kenya. Secondly, legalizing prostitution will lead to increased involvement in immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking, as substantiated by research conducted by Maxwell and others, who found a strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes. Thirdly, legalizing prostitution will lead to increased violence against women, as research conducted by Giobbe found similarities in the behavior of pimps and batterers, particularly through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence. Lastly, opponents argue that selling one's body is immoral and violates feminist principles. They argue that prostitution is a form of male dominance over women, which reduces them to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client, and is not a mutual and equal sex act."
"The debate centers around the legalization of prostitution, and its positive supporters argue that it should be legalized for several reasons. Firstly, legalizing prostitution would boost the economy, as it has been historically shown to be a functional part of the economy, with well-run prostitution providing revenue. Secondly, it would increase benefits for sex workers such as health care and unionization, as seen in the example of the Ministry of Justice considering legalizing prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income. Thirdly, legalizing prostitution would allow for regulation of the profession, making it safer and more secure for sex workers. Fourthly, it would make the profession safer for women, as interventions to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases can be launched. Finally, supporters of legalizing prostitution argue that it is a valid choice over one's own body, as sex work can be viewed as a profession or a way of making money, and is not inherently bad unless it is done against one's will."
"The opponents of legalizing sex selection argue that it can lead to gender imbalance as seen today with around 140 million missing women in the world due to son preference and gender-biased sex selection. The rise in sex selection reflects the persistent low status of women and girls and has a damaging effect on societies. They also argue that sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases, and parents should not act like "
"The debate topic is whether sex selection should be legalized. Those who support the legalization of sex selection provide several arguments. Firstly, they argue that selecting the sex of the child is within the freedom of the parents. It allows them to plan for their family, ensuring an adequate number of children that they can raise and provide good education and proper nutrition for. Secondly, sex selection allows for better family planning, especially in countries like China where couples are only allowed to have one or two children, and gender selection gives parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father's family name. Thirdly, sex selection makes the family happier and more complete as parents may have a preference for a baby of a certain gender. Fourthly, sex selection prevents diseases in the child by potentially allowing the selection of embryos without genetic disorders, matching a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, and decreasing cancer predisposition. Lastly, sex selection can prevent abortions and infanticide, which is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females. Therefore, those in support of the legalization of sex selection argue that it has many benefits for families and children."
"The debate revolves around the topic of prohibiting flag burning. Opponents of this idea argue that flag burning is an effective tool of expression, protest, and critique. They support their argument by citing the case of Miller's attorney, who argued that burning a draft card is a form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible. This means that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment, and flag burning falls under this category. 

Furthermore, opponents also argue that flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression. They cite the fact that the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable. While flag desecration may be offensive to some, the expression of an idea must be protected by the government. 

In summary, opponents of the idea to prohibit flag burning argue that it is a form of expression protected by the First Amendment, and the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because it is offensive to some."
"The debate topic is whether flag burning should be prohibited or not. The supporters of the prohibition argue that flags are important symbols that should be respected. They provide evidence that just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender. If there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront? Additionally, they argue that flag burning is an inflammatory act and provide evidence that according to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration. Therefore, the supporters of the prohibition argue that flag burning should be prohibited to show respect for important symbols and prevent inflammatory acts."
"The debate centers on whether women should be allowed to serve in combat. Opponents of the statement argue that there should be equality between men and women, and women are an asset in combat. They argue that warfare is changing and becoming high-tech, making physical strength less important. They also contend that women can create unique skills and strategies and can overcome differences to be just as capable in combat. Furthermore, women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to and should be accepted as long as they pass the tests. They conclude that just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths, and if they can meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team."
"The debate is on whether women should be prohibited from serving in combat roles. The positive supporters of the proposition argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women. They cite physical differences between men and women as a hindrance to women serving in combat units. The US Army is considering reversing gender-neutral physical tests as women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The supporters argue that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers, making them less suitable for combat roles. They argue that women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. The supporters suggest that women should serve in safer roles as only 4% of women are in combat positions, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Finally, supporters of the proposition argue that women soldiers' capture is a big concern as they do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men, making them less consistent and dependable in tough situations."
"The opponents of the proposition that 'we should subsidize journalism' put forth three main arguments. Firstly, they argue that government intervention in journalism carries the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. This is because if the government funds journalism, they will regulate it, which could impinge upon the freedom of the press. Evidence cited in support of this includes the fact that freedom of the press has to include the freedom for the press to fail. 

Secondly, they contend that it is preferable to spend money elsewhere. They argue that postal subsidies from the past, which have been cited as a precedent for this proposal, are irrelevant as they were created in a time when there was only one medium of communication, newspapers. In contrast, today's media landscape consists of multiple forms of print, broadcast, and digital communication, and federal subsidies would be a hindrance to entrepreneurs and protect inefficient companies, resulting in winners and losers being chosen.

Lastly, they argue that journalism is like every other business and if it is not sustainable, it should fail. The federal government cannot afford to bail out newspapers and the taxpayers cannot afford to bail out undeserving media companies. Evidence cited to support this includes the fact that the federal government has already bailed out undeserving banks and automobile manufacturers and is grappling with fixing the healthcare system, leaving no room to rescue the journalism industry."
"The debate topic is whether or not we should subsidize journalism. Those in favor of subsidizing journalism have put forth several claims to support their stance. 

Firstly, they argue that a subsidy is crucial for the financial viability of journalism. This is especially important in times of crisis, such as during the pandemic, where advertising revenues have decreased significantly. 

Secondly, supporters of subsidizing journalism argue that journalism is important for spreading information and promoting accountability. They cite a report that states that mainstream media is essential to topical social media conversations in the UK. 

Thirdly, it is argued that subsidies will increase the quality of journalism. By providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against powerful incumbents. This will introduce voters to different ideas and highlight conflicting opinions, which will facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news. 

Lastly, supporters argue that subsidies increase objectivity in reporting. Peace journalism is cited as an example of how presenting anomalous local perspectives that contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism can help expose violent groups' attempts to promote their violence. 

In summary, those in favor of subsidizing journalism argue that it is crucial for the financial viability of journalism, important for spreading information and promoting accountability, increases the quality of journalism, and increases objectivity in reporting."
"The opponents argue that we should not subsidize space exploration because it can be carried out by the private sector. Evidence suggests that in recent years, NASA has partnered with private, for-profit rocket companies like Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX, which hope to expand space exploration at a rapid rate. They also claim that space exploration is expensive and can cost billions of dollars. Furthermore, it is ineffective and responsible for large amounts of pollution. Lastly, there are other issues that need funding, and the $19.3 billion annual budget for space exploration could be used to pay for education, healthcare, or to fund other important programs."
"The debate is centered around whether or not to subsidize space exploration. Those who are in favor of subsidizing space exploration have presented several arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets. This can help to expand the horizons of human civilization and also address resource depletion on Earth. Secondly, space exploration can improve science and technology through research on space missions involving human crews that can facilitate studies in biomedicine and materials science. Thirdly, space exploration can be financially beneficial as satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040. Fourthly, space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity, as we will one day build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. Finally, space exploration unravels information about the universe and increases knowledge of the cosmos, which can ultimately benefit humanity."
"The opponents of the idea of subsidizing vocational education have made several claims. Firstly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes. They cite a report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019, which found that many vocational education programs may not provide the skills and knowledge that workers need to succeed in the 21st century, and therefore may have limited benefits for the economy.

Secondly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education is expensive, and can be limited by the ability to scale, as many programs may not have the resources or infrastructure to serve large numbers of students. They cite a study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020, which supports this claim.

Thirdly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions. They point to a study that analyzed the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany and found that the subsidies led to an increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs, suggesting that subsidies for vocational education can influence student choice and lead to an influx in those fields.

Finally, opponents of vocational education claim that vocational education is not a good career choice as many programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience. The evidence cited in support of this claim is the same report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019."
"The debate topic is whether we should subsidize vocational education or not. The positive supporters of the statement argue that we should subsidize vocational education. They have presented four claims to support their stance. Firstly, subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources. A study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education can increase economic mobility, particularly for individuals who may not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education or who face barriers to employment. Secondly, vocational education better fits many students. According to a report by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019, vocational education programs often offer customized learning experiences tailored to the individual needs and interests of students, which can better fit the learning styles of many students compared to traditional academic programs. Thirdly, vocational education is a good career choice. A report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that individuals with vocational education often have a shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education. Finally, vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society. A study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that vocational education programs can promote workforce diversity by providing training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by increasing the representation of diverse individuals in the workforce."
