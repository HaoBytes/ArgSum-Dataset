"The debate is about whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offense or not. Opponents of this view argue that assisted suicide provides dignity to the person who wants to commit it. They state that it reduces suffering and that people should have the freedom to choose to end their life. Furthermore, the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide. Evidence supporting these claims includes the fact that the concept of dignity suits the intuitions that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death. In addition, studies from parts of the world that have legalized assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally. The opponents also argue that physician-assisted suicide knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Furthermore, they argue that in some cases not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide. Overall, opponents of the view that assisted suicide should be a criminal offense believe that it is a fundamental right for terminally ill patients to choose when and how they end their lives."
"The debate topic is whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offence. Supporters of the criminalization of assisted suicide make three main claims. Firstly, they argue that assisted suicide violates the role of doctors. This is supported by evidence from the organization which argues that making doctors the agents of a patient's death outweighs any advantages of assisted suicide. Additionally, the State of New York has enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide. Secondly, they claim that people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others. Evidence for this claim comes from the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it. Thirdly, they argue that people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. This is supported by the slippery slope argument which claims that accepting certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable. Additionally, studies in the Netherlands fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to nonvoluntary euthanasia of vulnerable groups such as children, the demented, the mentally ill, and the elderly."
"The opponents of the ban on homeschooling argue that it should not be banned because it is the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional, religious, ill, and disabled students. Homeschooling can also be personalized to the child's pace and needs, which allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people. Furthermore, mainstream schools have a lot of violence and bullying, which homeschooling can protect children from. Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children because they want to have a deeper understanding of their children's education progress, give their children the liberty to explore their own family's culture, and take direct responsibility for their children's education. Finally, the home is a good learning environment that can provide real opportunities for children to structure their own days, enjoy a broader socialization, and become more mature than their schooled peers."
"The debate revolves around whether homeschooling should be banned or not. Supporters of the ban argue that homeschooling cannot be standardized, as there is a lack of regulation in some areas, which can lead to poor-quality education. Mainstream schools are considered essential to develop social skills, as homeschooling deprives children of work experience opportunities, sports leagues, and recognition and reward. The National Education Association and the European Court of Human Rights oppose homeschooling, citing the potential for a one-sided point of view and the need for regulation. Moreover, parents are not qualified as teachers, and it requires a significant amount of time and energy to ensure that children's educational needs are met."
"The opponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations argue that they are dangerous and can have negative side effects. For example, the rotavirus vaccine was pulled from the market after it was discovered that it could cause bowel obstruction, and there are reports of pneumonia being caused by the chickenpox vaccine. Additionally, mandatory vaccination is seen as a contradiction of basic rights. The First Amendment of the US Constitution prohibits the government from interfering with the free exercise of religion, which could include not getting vaccinated for religious reasons. Furthermore, mandatory vaccination is seen as an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"The debate topic is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. The supporters of mandatory vaccinations present five claims with evidence to support them. Firstly, they argue that routine child vaccinations are effective in preventing diseases such as pneumococcal and polio. Secondly, they claim that vaccinations save lives by preventing infections and deaths from diseases. Thirdly, mandatory vaccinations are necessary to protect others, as unvaccinated individuals can spread diseases to those who cannot receive vaccinations. Fourthly, mandatory vaccinations prevent the spread of viruses and diseases, as shown by the eradication of smallpox and the effectiveness of pertussis vaccines. Finally, children should not suffer from preventable diseases, and vaccine hesitancy can result in disease outbreaks and deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Based on these claims and evidence, the supporters of mandatory vaccinations believe that it is necessary to make routine child vaccinations mandatory."
"The opponents of the proposition that social media platforms should be regulated by the government argue that social media regulation is not effective. They cite examples of landmark legislation, such as the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, and G.D.P.R., which have had little impact on data-collection practices by Facebook, Google and others. They also argue that regulation harms privacy and leads to government intervention that can threaten freedom of speech and other democratic rights. Furthermore, they assert that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, and that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government. For instance, political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom have suppressed voting and political participation, polarising voters, lowering trust in institutions, and degrading the quality of democracy."
"The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. Those who support social media regulation have put forth the following claims and evidence: 

Firstly, social media regulation protects younger audiences. Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. 

Secondly, social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news. The European Union reached a deal on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. 

Thirdly, social media regulation is beneficial to society at large. The proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms. The UK government is leading the way in tackling online harm with the forthcoming legislation, making social platforms safer by design. 

Fourthly, social media regulation can help to deal with negative content. The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. 

Lastly, social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users. The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things. 

In summary, social media regulation is supported by those who believe that it can protect younger audiences, deal with fake news, benefit society at large, help to deal with negative content, and deal with malicious users."
"The opponents of the claim that 'The USA is a good country to live in' have presented several arguments. Firstly, they argue that the US has unfair health and education policies, citing evidence that black and Hispanic adults face more difficulty affording healthcare costs, and that white teachers give more constructive feedback to white students than to Black or Latino students. Secondly, they argue that the US has a problematic and divisive political system, with increasing divisions between the two parties based on various identities. Thirdly, they argue that the US has a negative culture, characterized by misuse of technology, sexual immorality, video game violence, and little respect for one another. Fourthly, they argue that the US has high taxation and a high cost of living, citing evidence that a struggling family in Manhattan is taxed at a higher rate than a family with the same standard of living in Atlanta. Fifthly, they argue that the US has inequality and poverty, with evidence showing that a disproportionate number of homeless people are male, black, middle-aged, veterans, and disabled. Sixthly, they argue that the US is unsafe, with evidence showing that many people are worried about violent crime and feel less safe than they did five years ago. Lastly, they argue that the US is xenophobic and racist, citing evidence of hate crimes against Asian Americans and arguments that white supremacy exists in US school curriculum. These arguments present a compelling case against the claim that the USA is a good country to live in."
The supporters of the statement 
"The opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy argue that it allows priests to focus on God and their spiritual life without being distracted by other obligations. They cite evidence from Paul VI and early Christian theologian Origen that supports the concept of celibacy as a strong religious belief and a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ. Additionally, they claim that celibacy makes priests appear more holy to the public and that it is a voluntary choice made by those who take the vows of celibacy, obedience, and poverty. The opponents argue that maintaining religious traditions and experiences is important, and that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts. They support their argument with evidence of the recent sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church and the findings of the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia that “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”."
"The debate topic is whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned or not. The positive supporters argue that celibacy should be abandoned because it is outdated, too pressuring and difficult, unhealthy and unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behavior, and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. The first argument is supported by evidence stating that the vow of celibacy had been changed to one of conjugal fidelity by Pope Paul III in 1540, and there is no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice of priestly celibacy before the fourth century. The second argument is supported by evidence stating that celibacy is challenging because of sexual chemistry, and it can lead to hardship and loneliness. The third argument is supported by evidence stating that celibacy is an unnatural act in nature and can cause depression and conflict. The fourth argument is supported by evidence stating that ignoring the vow of celibacy can lead to sexual abuse and a bad reputation for the clergy. The fifth argument is supported by evidence stating that ending celibacy could address the priest shortage and increase the number of people who want to become priests."
The opponents of the topic 
"The supporters of the idea that we should abandon marriage argue that the preservation of norms within marriage is harmful to women. This is evidenced by the fact that women are expected to be submissive to male family members, including their husbands, and face physical violence if they do not comply. Additionally, millions of girls undergo female genital mutilation as a prerequisite to marriage or to control their sexuality. Marriages are also unstable, as divorce rates have increased globally since the 1970s due to changes in expectations within marriages, particularly as more women entered the workforce. Marriages also tie people up with unfair obligations, such as Qatar's laws that require women to have male guardian permission to marry and lose their right to financial support if they are deemed "
"The opponents of abandoning school uniform argue that it has several benefits. Firstly, children can still express themselves using other means such as buttons or jewelry, according to a former student at Hershey High School and research published by Andrea Dashiell. Secondly, school uniforms reduce bullying, as found by the Department of Education and a study commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award. Thirdly, school uniforms create a sense of equality and unity among students, according to a Texas survey and the belief of 89% of teachers. Fourthly, school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning, as students in uniform are more focused on their academics, according to Natasha Irshad. Finally, school uniforms save costs for families, as one year of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150 compared to an average of $300 per child for back-to-school clothing, according to a NY Post article."
"The debate topic is whether we should abandon the use of school uniform. Those who support abandoning the use of school uniform argue that school uniform harms learning and creativity, harms student self-expression, is expensive, often uncomfortable and sexist, and increases conformity or harms individuality. 

They provide evidence to support each of these claims. For example, studies have shown that school uniforms can have a negative impact on students' creativity and self-expression. Furthermore, they argue that school uniforms are often expensive and can be uncomfortable or even sexist. Finally, they argue that school uniforms increase conformity and harm individuality.

Overall, those who argue that we should abandon the use of school uniform believe that the negative impact of school uniforms outweighs any potential benefits, and that students would be better served by being able to express themselves freely through their clothing choices."
"The opponents of abolishing capital punishment argue that it should remain in place for several reasons. Firstly, they claim that the death penalty brings closure and justice to victims' families, as well as expressing the moral outrage of society towards the most heinous crimes. This is supported by the statements of Henry McMaster and Leslie Rutledge, who believe that capital punishment can deter other would-be murderers and prevent further crimes. Secondly, they argue that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, despite the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintaining that it is contrary to customary international law. Finally, they claim that the death penalty prevents crimes, citing studies that show a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates, as well as a deterrent effect. This is supported by the research of David Muhlhausen and Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd."
"The supporters of abolishing capital punishment argue that it is fundamentally wrong for the state to sanction killing, and provide evidence to support their claims. They argue that the death penalty is often applied in an unjust and discriminatory manner, with people of color being more likely to be executed than white people, and innocent people are too often sentenced to death. Additionally, the death penalty harms the disenfranchised by diverting resources from other cases and is a waste of taxpayer funds, with no public safety benefit. Finally, the death penalty is irreversible, and there is no evidence to suggest that it serves as a deterrent to serious crime. Therefore, it is time for all nations, including the United States, to abolish capital punishment."
"The opponents argue against the abolition of intellectual property rights, stating that they incentivize creativity, innovation, investment in new products, and protect against stealing. They provide evidence to support their claims, such as UPOV's encouragement of plant breeders to develop new plant varieties, the PRO-IP Act's protection of American intellectual property to benefit the US economy and job market, and the Business Software Alliance's claim that public opinion supports paying innovators for their technological advances. The opponents also argue that intellectual property rights protect against stealing, as stated by Senator Leahy and evidenced by the NIPRCC's initiative to hinder intellectual property violations on the internet. Finally, they argue that people or businesses own their innovations and should be able to be compensated for their endeavors, with examples such as IPRs being essential to implement worldwide standards and providing a financial incentive for the creation and investment in intellectual property."
"The debate is about whether intellectual property rights should be abolished. The supporters of this stance argue that intellectual property hinders the continuous improvement of a service/product, restricts access to important information/products, is unfair, harms creativity/innovation, wastes money, and is ineffective. They provide evidence such as the case of Fox Talbot's patent in photography, the negative impact of intellectual monopolies on health and progress, the compromised process of making laws that benefits multinational corporations, the recognition of the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples, the iniquitous nature of Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights, the weakness of natural rights arguments for intellectual property, the ability of intellectual property laws to hinder innovation, and the high cost of protection. They also argue that intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state. They conclude that intellectual property rights should be abolished to promote free exchange of ideas and prevent social costs."
"The opponents of the proposition 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms' argue that gun control is ineffective because criminals predominantly obtain firearms illegally, and state and federal laws are not a deterrent. Furthermore, they assert that gun ownership is a right established by the Second Amendment and a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life. They also argue that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports-shooting, and promotes self-protection. These claims are supported by evidence such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics report, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, and Gallup survey data."
"The topic of debate is whether or not we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. Those who support the motion argue that banning guns would save lives, as shown by evidence such as a study published in the American Journal of Public Health that found a long-lasting increased risk of violent death associated with legal purchase of a handgun. Additionally, Harvard professor David Hemenway's research indicates that there are more homicides in developed countries where guns are more available. Supporters of the motion also argue that gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence, supported by evidence such as a 1993 study in The New England Journal of Medicine that found guns kept in the home increased the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance. Furthermore, a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10-unit increase in permissiveness over five years. Guns can also fall into the wrong hands, leading to tragic incidents, as shown by the Sutherland Springs, Texas church massacre, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns. Finally, guns lead to accidental deaths, particularly among children and adolescents due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms. Evidence from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance indicates that states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths, and 89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents' absence."
"The opponents of adopting an austerity regime argue that it is not a viable option. Firstly, austerity cuts access to essential services such as local authorities and public health grants, resulting in the destruction of a safety net built over many years, and leaving few public services unscathed. Secondly, austerity extends recessions and worsens the ongoing economic crisis, as experienced in Argentina, Russia, and Turkey. Thirdly, austerity is unfair to the citizens as it is a political choice that results in high levels of child poverty and violates human rights. Fourthly, austerity results in lower growth and undermines public finances and tax revenues. Finally, austerity results in lower job creation, as countries with more regulated labor markets have far lower job creation levels. Therefore, adopting an austerity regime is not recommended."
"The debate topic is about adopting an austerity regime, and the positive supporters have presented five claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that austerity improves economic measures and provide evidence from Latvia and Estonia showing that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. Secondly, they argue that austerity is important in the long term, and cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. The EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. Thirdly, they argue that austerity is important to increase stability, and Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s, but austerity measures and pro-market reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment. Fourthly, they argue that austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts, and countries use austerity measures to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. Finally, they argue that an austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times, and the successful model of austerity occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%, but President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%, and the debt dropped by more than 30%."
"The opponents of adopting atheism present two main arguments. Firstly, they claim that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. This is supported by evidence such as John Locke's belief that atheism would undermine social order and lead to chaos, as well as a protest campaign against a film that promotes atheism. Secondly, they argue that people should choose for themselves whether atheism should be adopted. This is supported by evidence such as the belief that choosing to believe in God or not is a personal choice without scientific proof either way, and the European Court of Human Rights finding that people cannot be forced to demonstrate views associated with a particular religion."
"The debate is centered around the adoption of atheism. The positive supporters argue that we should adopt atheism because it is beneficial to the person that adopts it. Atheism provides a superior basis for ethics, making atheists more inclined to evaluate the morality of imperatives themselves. Atheism also liberates human beings from various forms of oppression, which stand in the way of human progress. Additionally, we should adopt atheism because we cannot prove that God exists. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence. Belief in what is inherently unobservable is irrational, making the "
"The opponents of adopting libertarianism present several compelling claims against it. Firstly, they argue that libertarianism harms economic growth, as demonstrated by the failure of Northern Rock, which was connected to Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy. Additionally, poorly constructed government regulation can do more harm than good by increasing inequality, as argued by Steven Teles and Brink Lindsey. Secondly, opponents contend that libertarianism harms minorities and those who are worse off, as a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, which rejects the notion of inalienable rights, according to philosopher Robert Nozick. Thirdly, they claim that libertarianism is unjust/non-equal, as market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes, and markets fail to address important social needs. Fourthly, libertarianism removes essential laws, infrastructure, and government services such as legalizing victimless crimes and advocating for the protection of natural rights. Lastly, opponents argue that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens, as the government plays a crucial role in protecting basic human rights and the environment."
"The debate topic is whether we should adopt libertarianism or not. The positive supporters of libertarianism present four main claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that libertarianism increases economic growth. Advocates of reduced taxation argue that this leads to increased financial freedom and economic prosperity. Secondly, they argue that libertarianism increases freedom in the political system. By limiting the role of the government, individuals are better able to make their own decisions, leading to increased freedom and individual prosperity. Thirdly, they argue that libertarianism increases happiness and fulfillment as individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. Finally, they argue that libertarianism increases individual freedom and liberties as people are free to do what they like and opt out of undesirable arrangements. The evidence presented includes sources such as economists, psychologists, and philosophers who support the claims made by libertarians. Overall, the positive supporters of libertarianism present a strong argument for adopting this political ideology."
"The opponents of banning human cloning argue that it should not be banned because it can be used for various purposes such as organ replication, helping those who cannot have a child, promoting health, and promoting science and research. Regarding organ replication, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation and cloning can be used to create customized organs specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. Cloning can also help couples who are struggling with infertility by creating a child genetically related to one of the parents. Moreover, cloning can be used to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases, which can greatly advance stem cell research. Lastly, some states specifically permitted human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells or legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research, which shows that cloning promotes science and research."
"The debate topic is whether we should ban human cloning or not. The positive supporters argue that we should ban human cloning based on four main claims. Firstly, cloning is not understood enough yet and allowing cloning would lead to converting procreation into manufacture and treating children as projects of our will. Secondly, cloning is unethical and anti-religious since it involves the manipulation and destruction of human embryos which is not morally acceptable. Thirdly, cloning is unnatural and disrupts the familial order as it involves removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship. Finally, cloning is unsafe as it risks transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child and has a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death. Therefore, based on these claims, the supporters of banning human cloning argue that it is necessary to prevent any negative consequences that may arise from this practice."
"The opponents of banning private military companies present four arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that hiring private military companies is financially beneficial. Studies have shown that private military companies can provide more efficient services and cost savings for the government compared to traditional military personnel. Secondly, they claim that private military companies are well-trained and better equipped due to their specialized training programs and investment in advanced technology. Thirdly, opponents argue that private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies cannot or do not want to do, providing access to specialized skills and expertise. Finally, they contend that private military companies increase safety by providing more efficient use of resources and support services, freeing up regular army personnel to focus on other tasks."
"The debate is centered on the ban of private military companies. The supporters of this notion argue that private military companies are unethical and are likely to violate rights and commit crimes. For instance, a report by the United Nations in 2004 revealed that private military companies use child soldiers in conflict zones, while the Congressional Research Service discovered evidence of unlawful killings of civilians by private military companies in 2010. Additionally, private military companies have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, leading to increased risk and decreased professionalism in their operations. According to a study published in the Journal of Military Ethics in 2009, private military companies can face a conflict of interest if they have loyalty to multiple countries, potentially leading to a lack of trust in their actions. Private military companies' primary interest is profit, and they often prioritize profit over ethical and legal considerations, which is evident in a report by Human Rights Watch in 2006. Furthermore, private military companies have a financial incentive to prolong conflicts, as they profit from their continued involvement, according to a report by the Project on Government Oversight in 2008. Thus, private military companies should be banned since their operations are less professional, they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country, and they have a financial incentive to solicit, engage or prolong conflicts."
"The debate topic is whether we should ban the use of child actors. Opponents argue against the ban by presenting four claims. First, acting may be the child's dream, supported by evidence that some children have natural talent for acting and that it can provide a way for them to express their emotions. Second, child performers are necessary for roles, as casting them can increase diversity and provide opportunities for more actors, including children. Third, child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation, exemplified by a TV show segment that obeyed child labor laws. Finally, opponents argue that parents should decide for their child, supported by evidence that parents can provide individualized attention and care for their children, and that not all child actors have the best parents."
"The debate topic is whether the use of child actors should be banned. Supporters of this ban argue that child actors face several challenges and risks, and should therefore not be allowed to perform. One of their main arguments is that being a performer harms the child's education. Studies have found that child performers often miss school or receive inadequate education, leading to a lack of basic skills and knowledge. Additionally, child performers are at risk of exploitation, as they may be subject to labor violations and may even be at risk of human trafficking. Supporters of the ban also argue that child performers are losing their childhood, as they are often exposed to unhealthy working conditions and are subject to a lot of pressure. This pressure can also lead to mental health issues, which may have negative impacts on their well-being later in life. In fact, there are many instances of troubled adult lives due to the stressful environment to which child actors are subjected. Therefore, supporters of the ban argue that it is necessary to protect the well-being and development of child actors by prohibiting their use in the entertainment industry."
"The opponents argue that closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp would harm national security. The evidence shows that approximately 17.5% of former detainees confirmed of reengaging in terrorist activities, and 80 detainees remaining are hardened terrorists, which puts the country's security at risk. The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is also better for prisoners than the alternatives, as it provides humane treatment, exceeds maximum-security prison standards, and offers medical care. Moreover, the camp is an essential location to gain intelligence, as it was designed to be an intelligence center of excellence in the war on terror, and the need to obtain intelligence from high-ranking terrorists remains critical for national security."
"The supporters of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp argue that there are several reasons to do so. Firstly, detainees have the right to trial in US courts, as affirmed by the US Supreme Court's ruling in Boumediene v. Bush. Additionally, the camp harms the reputation of the US as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it is a symbol of discrimination and injustice. The camp is also expensive to maintain, with an estimated annual cost of $540 million. Moreover, personnel at the camp have committed crimes against prisoners, including torture, and unjust tactics are used there, such as stress positions, isolation, and hooding during transportation and questioning. Therefore, the supporters believe that closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp is necessary."
"The opponents of ending affirmative action argue that it should not be ended because it boosts diversity, compensates for the past, and reduces discrimination. They provide evidence to support these claims. Affirmative action has been proven to increase diversity and provide access to underrepresented groups, as demonstrated by a decline in admissions for students of color after affirmative action bans go into effect. Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for past discrimination, as it was designed to correct and prevent discrimination from recurring. It has also been upheld by court cases as a means to reduce discrimination, such as in Johnson v. Transportation Agency. The National Organization for Women also argues that affirmative action levels the playing field for people of color and women in education and business, as white men hold a disproportionate amount of high-level corporate jobs. Therefore, affirmative action should be continued to promote diversity, compensate for the past, and reduce discrimination."
"The topic under discussion is whether affirmative action should be ended or not. The supporters of ending affirmative action have put forward several claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities. Opponents believe that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive. Secondly, affirmative action is ineffective. Arizona passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action in 2010, which indicates that it is not an effective policy. Thirdly, affirmative action is not just. Asian-American students are marked down on "
"The opponents of ending mandatory retirement argue that it creates opportunities for other workers. They presented two evidences to support this claim. Firstly, a report by the International Labour Organization in 2012 showed that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people by encouraging older workers to leave the workforce and make room for younger workers. Secondly, a study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that mandatory retirement ages can promote intergenerational equity, as younger workers are given more opportunities to enter the workforce and build their careers."
"The debate is about whether or not to end mandatory retirement, and the positive supporters argue that we should end it. They make five claims to support their stance. First, they argue that mandatory retirement decreases institutional knowledge, as shown by the lack of mandatory retirement for Air Traffic Controllers in the UK and the success of a businessman who implemented policies against mandatory retirement. Second, they argue that mandatory retirement harms the economy by reducing workforce diversity and labor force participation, as evidenced by studies by the World Economic Forum and the OECD. Third, they argue that mandatory retirement is unfair and discriminatory, as older workers are forced to retire regardless of their ability to continue working and individual circumstances, as shown by the AARP and ILO studies. Fourth, they argue that mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, as supported by evidence from studies by Jonathan Gruber and David Wise and by Richard Johnson, Jonathan Schwabish and Jennifer Topper. Finally, they argue that we should let everyone retire when they are ready to promote active aging, well-being, and individual choice, as shown by reports by the AARP and the World Health Organization."
"The opponents of the abolition of nuclear weapons argue that they are essential for protection and deterrence. They believe that nuclear deterrence has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years. They provide evidence that the invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence since Ukraine was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine, and Moscow spares their territory."
"The supporters of the abolition of nuclear weapons argue that there are compelling reasons to eliminate these weapons from the world. Firstly, there is a significant risk that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands, which could lead to catastrophic consequences. This risk is not merely theoretical, as there is evidence that terrorist groups such as ISIS have expressed their desire to acquire nuclear weapons. Secondly, the presence of nuclear weapons provokes or escalates disastrous military actions, as the potential for mass destruction and loss of life is too great to ignore. This is illustrated by the estimated death tolls in the event of a nuclear attack, as well as the recent tensions between Russia and NATO over the use of nuclear weapons in the conflict in Ukraine. Therefore, the supporters argue that it is necessary to take action to abolish nuclear weapons in order to prevent such catastrophic events from occurring."
"The opponents argue against the stance that 'We should fight urbanization' and present three claims with supporting evidence. Firstly, they argue that cities offer more opportunities, as evidenced by migration to urban areas for better lives and increased urbanization leading to growing economic opportunities. Secondly, they argue that urbanization benefits the economy, as evidenced by government policies encouraging the urbanization of China's rural population and the positive effects of urbanization on economic growth, efficiency, diversity, occupational and social mobility, and adaptability. Thirdly, they argue that urbanization benefits the environment, as evidenced by driving innovation including green technologies and bringing higher productivity due to positive externalities and economies of scale, which reduces the ecological footprint."
"The topic of the debate is whether we should fight urbanization or not. The positive supporters argue that we should fight urbanization based on the following claims and evidence. 

Firstly, they argue that restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically and socially. Evidence 1 shows that Venezuela's rural areas have seen economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment, resulting in a net food importer. Similarly, Evidence 2 suggests that protecting natural resources can prevent rural to urban migration. 

Secondly, they argue that urbanization causes crime. Evidence 1 shows that increased urban migration in New Zealand led to a rise in urban crime, poverty, and health problems. Evidence 2 shows that the rapid urbanization and growing population in India have increased criminal activities. 

Thirdly, they argue that urbanization harms the environment. Evidence 1 suggests that increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies, and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water. Evidence 2 shows that rapid economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization increase energy demand and air pollutant emissions, which can affect plant metabolism. 

Finally, they argue that urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources. Evidence 1 shows that overurbanization leads to inadequate housing, almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease, high mortality, and large urban groups with no access to educational facilities. Evidence 2 suggests that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage it, leading to migrant workers without an affordable place to live in. 

In summary, the supporters of fighting urbanization argue that urbanization has negative effects on the economy, society, environment, and cities' resources."
"The opponents of introducing compulsory voting have presented three main claims. Firstly, abstaining from voting is also a way of expressing one's preferences, as it can indicate ambivalence, mild disapproval, lack of information or reluctance to vote against popular sentiment. Secondly, citizens have a right not to vote, and mandatory voting would violate their freedom of speech and civil liberties. Finally, compulsory voting may result in uninformed or random voting, as people who are less informed are more likely to be influenced by negative advertising and slogans, and mandatory voting can increase the vote share of mainstream parties while reducing the diversity of political representation."
"The topic of the debate is whether compulsory voting should be introduced. The positive supporters of this proposition put forward three main claims. Firstly, that compulsory voting increases representation. This is supported by evidence showing that boosting turnout is a matter of justice and representation and that compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all voters. Secondly, supporters argue that compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. This is evidenced by the idea that it increases political education and that concerns about declining democratic engagement have been raised. Finally, supporters claim that people have an obligation to vote, citing a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms and that compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout. Overall, the supporters of compulsory voting believe that it is necessary to ensure that everyone is represented and that democracy is upheld."
"The opponents of legalizing cannabis argue that it should not be legalized because it can harm the body, increase lack-of-judgment/accidents, act as a gateway drug/addictive, and get into the hands of underage teenagers/children. Heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana can change blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Additionally, an increase in THC content can impair psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers. Furthermore, cannabis can cause people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. The percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis has increased, and cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers and individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Cannabis triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine, which creates good feelings, leading to repeated use and addiction, which is a brain disease. It also alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on the brain, causing the user to use more heroin. Lastly, legal cannabis can be easily accessed by underage teenagers/children, leading to an increase in cannabis use. Therefore, the opponents believe that cannabis should not be legalized."
"The debate topic is about legalizing cannabis, and its positive supporters have presented five claims. Firstly, they argue that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal, citing evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. Secondly, they believe that legalizing cannabis is financially beneficial, and it could generate billions in annual tax revenues and reduce government spending for prohibition enforcement. Thirdly, they argue that cannabis is safe, healthy, and provides pain relief. Fourthly, if cannabis were legalized, it could be regulated, and cannabis-related crimes could be reduced. Lastly, supporters believe that legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market and criminal activity, and it could decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking, leading to a decrease in drug-related violent crime."
"The opponents of legalizing prostitution put forward three main claims. Firstly, legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, with evidence indicating that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population, and that a significant number of registered and foreign prostitutes have tested HIV positive. Secondly, legalizing sex work will increase immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking, with evidence indicating that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs. Additionally, there is a strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime. Thirdly, legalizing sex work will increase violence against women, with evidence indicating that it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men. Additionally, the unintended consequences of legalization can drive women in prostitution underground, increasing the risk of violence and harm to the most vulnerable. Feminists argue that prostitution has a negative effect on society as a whole, as it reinforces existing patriarchal societal order."
"The debate topic is whether prostitution should be legalized or not. Those in favor of legalizing prostitution argue that it would bring several benefits. Firstly, legalizing sex work can boost the economy, as was the case with Seattle's founder, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard. Secondly, it could increase the benefits available to sex workers, such as health care, safe sex, unionization, and labor rights, as advocated by the Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour. Thirdly, legalizing sex work can allow it to be regulated, which could enhance safety and human rights, as is the case with the Dutch policy of tolerance towards prostitution. Fourthly, it would make the profession safer for women by reducing harm, protecting them from exploitation and trafficking. Lastly, sex work is a valid choice over one's body, which can provide greater disposable income and access to lifestyle options. Overall, these benefits suggest that legalizing prostitution could be a positive step for society."
"The opponents of legalizing sex selection argue that it can have negative consequences. Firstly, it can lead to gender imbalance, as seen in countries such as India and China where having boys is preferred over having girls. This has led to a decline in the number of girls being born and a significant gender gap. Secondly, sex selection reinforces gender stereotypes and biases, particularly in traditional and rural areas where son preference is strong. Thirdly, legalizing sex selection can result in an increase in abortions and infanticide, as parents can choose to abort a female fetus or even neglect and kill female infants. These negative consequences outweigh any potential benefits of legalizing sex selection."
"The debate topic is 'We should legalize sex selection', and the proponents of the topic have presented five claims to support their stance. 

The first claim is that it is within the freedom of parents to select the sex of the child. They argue that gender selection allows parents to fulfill their wish or desire to have a daughter or son, instilling gender balance in the family. They also state that it could prevent gender-specific diseases from being passed on to the baby.

The second claim is that sex selection allows for better family planning. They state that gender selection gives parents effective control over the number of children they want and helps parents in countries like China, where couples are allowed only one or two children, to have a male child who will carry the father's family name. 

The third claim is that sex selection makes the family happier and complete. They argue that parents or couples may prefer a specific gender for their first-born or want a gender to balance their family, and sex selection gives them an opportunity to fulfill their wishes.

The fourth claim is that sex selection prevents diseases in the child. They state that selecting a female embryo offspring can prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases and can also be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are more prevalent in one sex.

The fifth claim is that sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide. They argue that gender selection provides intended parents with the ability to pick the sex of their children, and some may not even realize they have a preference until they have the option to choose. They also state that female infanticide is a significant issue in some countries where baby girls are killed due to a preference for male babies.

Overall, the proponents of the topic argue that legalizing sex selection will provide parents with more freedom and control over their family planning, make the family happier and complete, prevent diseases, and prevent abortions and infanticide."
"The opponents of the topic 'We should prohibit flag burning' argue that flag burning is a form of expression, protest, and critique, which makes it an effective tool. They support their argument with evidence such as the case of Gregory Lee Johnson, who was convicted of flag desecration in Texas but was later ruled in favor by the court. The court stated that flag burning is a form of expression and, therefore, protected under the First Amendment. Additionally, they argue that flag burning is justified under freedom of expression, citing Justice William Brennan's opinion that flag burning is protected speech under the First Amendment. Thus, they believe that prohibiting flag burning would be a violation of the First Amendment."
"The topic being debated is whether or not flag burning should be prohibited. Supporters of the proposition argue that flags are important symbols that should be respected, and flag burning is an inflammatory act. They cite evidence that laws against flag-burning are constitutional and that all states had adopted flag desecration laws by 1932, which outlawed placing any kind of marking on the flag, using it in any form of advertising, and publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt upon it. Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that it is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed, and evidence was presented of a protest march that culminated with the burning of the American flag, along with a consistently anti-US line being broadcast on a local radio station. Overall, supporters of the proposition believe that flag burning should be prohibited due to the importance of respecting flags as symbols and the inflammatory nature of the act."
"The opponents of the topic 'We should prohibit women in combat' put forth several compelling arguments. Firstly, there should be equality between men and women, and this has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957. Women have made significant progress in health and labor participation and are now considered an asset in combat. Studies show that women can create unique skills and strategies, and they can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat as men. Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to, and they should be accepted as long as they pass the tests, which are objective, measurable, role-related, and gender-free. It is sexist and stupid to keep women from fighting in combat, and the idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying. As Senator Ernst said, women would be essential in any future conflict, and they could serve in various roles, including the infantry or a cyber unit. Thus, women should not be prohibited from serving in combat roles."
"The debate is centered on whether women should be prohibited from serving in combat roles. The proponents of the idea believe that men are better suited for combat than women. They argue that women lack the physical and mental capabilities required for combat. The first argument presented is that women are generally physically smaller and have less muscle density than men. They argue that even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. The second argument is that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers that are required for combat. They provide evidence that shows only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units. They also argue that mixed-gender teams in close combat roles could have far-reaching and grave consequences. The third argument is that women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. They provide evidence that men have emotions when they see a woman in harm’s way and that mixed-gender teams could be a distraction. The fourth argument presented is that women should serve in safer roles. They provide evidence that only 4 percent of women are in combat positions and that in the Second World War, women served in non-combat roles. The fifth argument is that women soldiers' capture is a big concern. They argue that women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men and that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. They also provide evidence that every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Overall, the proponents of the idea believe that women should be prohibited from serving in combat roles."
"The opponents argue that government intervention to subsidize journalism can be problematic. They claim that such intervention has the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. They provide evidence to support this claim, such as political endorsements creating opportunities to construe favoritism in reporting and potentially creating a perceived conflict of interest. They also cite the example of the Church of Scientology complaining that Time Warner provided a safe harbor for biased journalism. Therefore, the opponents argue that subsidies for journalism can create problems with objectivity and should not be implemented."
"The supporters of subsidizing journalism argue that it is necessary to make journalism viable as it is becoming increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism. Additionally, they claim that journalism is important for information-spreading and accountability, citing examples of the Associated Press becoming increasingly important and efficient, and the trend of increased usage of non-institutionalized information during reporting and research work. Furthermore, they argue that subsidies will increase the quality of journalism as evident from the Ethical Journalism Initiative launched by the IFJ. The rationale behind this is that by providing subsidies, new entrants and small players can compete against the powerful incumbents, thus facilitating democratic decision-making."
"The opponents argue that space exploration should not be subsidized because it can be carried out by the private sector, it is expensive, ineffective, and there are more pressing issues to fund. They provide evidence such as the success of commercial space ventures like SpaceX, the high cost of space travel, the lack of scientific usefulness in human space exploration, and the need to prioritize issues like poverty. Additionally, they mention the dangers and potential waste of resources associated with space exploration."
"The debate is about whether or not we should subsidize space exploration. Those in favor of subsidizing it have presented five arguments. Firstly, space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets, which can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species. Secondly, space exploration improves science/technology by facilitating studies in biomedicine and materials science and by offering benefits to sectors like agriculture. Thirdly, space exploration is financially beneficial and has the potential to generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, with satellite broadband Internet access being the most significant short and medium-term opportunity. Fourthly, space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity as it will help us develop technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions, which we can use as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. Lastly, space exploration unravels information about the universe, making significant contributions to our understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems."
"The opponents argue against subsidizing vocational education by presenting four claims. Firstly, they state that it diverts money from other worthy causes such as early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education. They support this argument by referring to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020. Secondly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education is expensive because it requires significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty, and may not have the resources to serve a large number of students, as found by a report by the Center for American Progress in 2018 and a study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020. Thirdly, they assert that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions, as seen in Germany, where a large-scale subsidy program for vocational education led to a significant increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in academic programs. They also cite a study that analyzed the effects of a program in Germany that provided subsidies for vocational training and found that the program increased the demand for skilled workers in the relevant trades. Lastly, the opponents argue that vocational education is not a good career choice because many vocational education programs offer limited transferability of skills, making it difficult for workers to transition to new careers or industries. They also assert that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, as found by a report by the National Center for Education and the Economy in 2014 and a report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019."
"The debate topic is 'We should subsidize vocational education'. Those in favor of this proposition have put forward the following claims: 
Firstly, subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources, as it can improve workforce development, particularly for individuals who face barriers to employment. This is supported by a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019, which found that subsidizing vocational education can also better align with local labor market needs, particularly in regions with high demand for skilled workers.

Secondly, vocational education better fits many students as it provides a more direct path to employment, with programs designed to meet current workforce needs and provide relevant training and education. This is supported by a study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in 2020, which found that vocational education provides hands-on, practical learning that better fits the learning styles and interests of many students, compared to traditional classroom-based education.

Thirdly, vocational education is a good career choice as there is high demand for skilled workers in industries such as healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing, and vocational education can provide training and education in these fields. Additionally, individuals with vocational education often have shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education. These claims are supported by a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022 and a report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020.

Finally, vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society as it can address workforce shortages in specific fields and industries, which can benefit the entire market and society by filling in-demand jobs. Additionally, investments in vocational education can enhance social mobility by providing access to training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by increasing the opportunities available to individuals from diverse backgrounds. These claims are supported by a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 and a report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020. Overall, subsidizing vocational education can have significant benefits for individuals, the labor market, and society as a whole."
