"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
","Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence. As an ethical principle, it is wrong to take actions that have the primary purpose of ending a human life. Therefore, assisted suicide should not be legalised.","### Instruction: You are an expert debater.

"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'. The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made..
- claim_3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text..
- claim_4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
","The evidence suggests that assisted suicide can be criminalized without infringing upon a person's right to self-determination, as it does not involve any immediate danger to life, limb, or health. The arguments presented above make the case that, while assisted suicide may be seen as beneficial in certain cases, it should not be criminalized, as it does not involve any immediate danger to life, limb, or health. Therefore, the evidence suggests that assisted suicide should not be criminalized.","### Instruction: You are an expert debater.

"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..

"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design.

 ### Input: Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.

"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..

    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..

"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
","We should reject the idea that marriage should be abandoned. Marriage is important for people, and has many benefits for both adults and children. In addition, it has financial advantages for those who are married and those who cohabit. Therefore, we should strive to maintain strong marriages and support healthy relationships.","### Instruction: You are an expert debater.

A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
 

 ### Response: 
We should reject the idea that marriage should be abandoned. Marriage is important for people, and has many benefits for both adults and children. In addition, it has financial advantages for those who are married and those who cohabit. Therefore, we should strive to maintain strong marriages and support healthy relationships."
"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.

Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800!

    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.

    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases.

Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist?

- claim_2: Intellectual property restricts access to important information/products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Professor Lessig analyzes the tension that exists between the concepts of piracy and property in the intellectual property realm in the context of what he calls the present depressingly compromised process of making law that has been captured in most nations by multinational corporations that are interested in the accumulation of capital and not the free exchange of ideas..
- claim_3: Intellectual property rights are unfair.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The PHM views the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights(TRIPS) as iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries and poor patients..
- claim_4: Intellectual property rights harm creativity/innovation.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By 1852, many in the photographic community felt that Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property were hampering the development of photography in England and had called upon him to relinquish his patent..

 ### Response: 
  Input: We should abolish intellectual property rights. 
  Output: Abolishing intellectual property rights will free up resources that can be used to create, innovate, and produce. It will lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth, knowledge, and power."
"Given the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Gun control is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws.  A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..

"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..

    - Evidence 1: A report by UNICEF in 2016 found that child actors are often exploited and exposed to unhealthy working conditions, leading to the loss of their childhood..
- claim_4: Child performers have a lot of pressure.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014 found that child performers may experience mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, due to the pressure and stress associated with their work..
- claim_5: Child performers tend to develop problems later in life.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
 

 ### Response: 
We should not ban the use of child actors, as they bring valuable experience and skills to the entertainment industry. They also have the potential to become successful individuals in other fields, such as education and politics. While it is true that child performers often face a lot of pressure and have to cope with difficult working conditions, it is important to remember that a ban on child actors would have a detrimental effect on the entertainment industry and prevent them from acquiring valuable skills and experiences."

Additionally, the government could invest in green initiatives and infrastructure, as well as provide free education and healthcare to reduce poverty and mitigate the negative effects of overurbanization.","### Instruction: You are an expert debater.

"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters.

The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..

- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
","The European Court of Human Rights has long held that compulsory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, as attendance at a polling station is compulsory while voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot.  The ruling in 1971 held that “the only conceivable way of ensuring that citizens are able to enjoy their right to vote is to make voting compulsory.”  Thus, the Court found that the right to vote “implies the correlative obligation of citizens to exercise that right.”  In other words, while voting is compulsory, it is not obligatory to cast a ballot - the voter has the choice of either attending a polling station or abstaining from voting.  Thus, the option of abstaining from voting is a valid alternative to attending a polling station. 

Furthermore, the European Court of Human Rights has also ruled that “the only conceivable way of ensuring that citizens are able to exercise their right to vote is to make voting compulsory.”  Thus, the Court's 1971 decision upholds the right to abstain from voting as a valid alternative to attending a polling station.  It follows that compulsory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, as abstaining from voting is a valid alternative to attending a polling station.

"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..

"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
","We should legalize sex selection because it can lead to gender imbalance, which is a concern in certain regions of India and China, but not in the majority of the country. In addition, it can also result in abortions/infanticide, which is not desirable. Thus, legalizing sex selection is not the best solution.","### Instruction: You are an expert debater.

"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..

"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson.

"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..

We should allow women to serve in combat if they choose to and if they pass the tests."
"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
","Women should be prohibited from serving in combat roles. This is because they lack the physical strength and mental fortitude to perform such roles, and their presence can be a distraction and hinder performance. Furthermore, the IDF noted that fewer than 4% of women are in such roles, indicating that women are not adequately represented in such positions.","### Instruction: You are an expert debater.

"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
