In the debate on whether assisted suicide should be criminalised, the opponents argue that it should not be criminalised as it gives dignity to the person who wishes to commit it, reduces suffering, gives people the freedom to choose to end their life and benefits the terminally ill. Supporters of this view cite the evidence that the idea of assisted suicide securing human dignity is a popular idea as reflected in the names of organizations and laws concerning this issue; that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if certain criteria are met; that it contrasts with active euthanasia; and that it benefits the terminally ill, with Pratchett being an example."
"
In conclusion, assisted suicide should remain a criminal offence as it allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit, violates the doctor's role, is not an inherent right of individuals, and there is a risk of judgement impairment for people who are ill. The evidence provided demonstrates that physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, or worried about being a burden, as these can be signs of not every effort having been made. Additionally, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and a slippery slope argument was provided which supports the risk of non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia in the event of acceptance of assisted suicide."
"
In this debate, we are discussing the proposition of banning homeschooling. Opponents of the proposition argue that homeschooling should not be banned because it is often the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional, religious, ill or disabled students; homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace or needs; mainstream schools can be rife with violence and bullying; parents should be allowed to choose the education of their children; and finally, the home is a good learning environment. Evidence supporting these arguments include services offered by the Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools; the sense of autonomy which Gosling experienced; Holt's perspective that homeschooling isn't the answer to the badness of schools; homeschoolers' desire to have a deeper understanding of their children's education progress; and homeschoolers' desire to give their children a more active learning environment and a broader socialization."
"
In the debate, the argument that homeschooling should be banned has been made. The arguments for this position are that homeschools cannot be regulated or standardized, missing out on the essential experiences to develop social skills, mainstream schools are of higher educational quality and parents are not qualified as teachers. In support of this claim, evidence was given in the form of Vyckie Garrison's story of having to switch her six children to public school after 18 years of homeschooling due to her depleted energy, the lack of work experience, sports, and other opportunities that homeschooled children miss out on, the National Education Association's opposition to homeschooling, and Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich's assessment of the one-sided point of view that homeschooling can give children."

This debate centers around the argument that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. Proponents of the argument point to the efficacy of such vaccinations, while opponents cite the possible dangers posed by the vaccine or side effects, along with potential conflicts with basic human rights. The opponents of mandatory vaccinations bring up the case of Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), which was pulled from the market after it was discovered that the vaccine might have caused higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction). They also reference the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' In addition, they cite a study from Mayo Clinic which states that natural infection 'often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.' Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to make child vaccinations mandatory is a complicated one that requires a careful examination of all the potential benefits and harms."
"
This debate is on the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'. The positive supporters argue that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory, as they are effective, save lives, and are necessary to protect others from virus/disease spreading. Evidence for this stance includes: after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, a study found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those under two years of age; it is estimated that full vaccination of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections; in 2005, 66 cases of measles in the US were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who returned to a community with many unvaccinated children and this outbreak infected 34 people, three of which were hospitalized; smallpox killed an estimated 300-500 million people in the 20th century before it was eradicated in 1979; and finally, an estimated three million children die each year due to vaccine-preventable diseases. With this evidence, it is clear that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory in order to prevent unnecessary suffering, save lives, and protect the health of others."
"
In this debate, we discuss the statement 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government'. Opponents of this statement put forward five claims - that social media regulation is not effective, that it harms privacy, harms freedom of speech and other democratic rights, that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, and that it can lead to political abuses by the government. To support their arguments, opponents cite examples such as the ineffectiveness of the G.D.P.R. legislation, the lack of control individuals have over their personal information, the restrictions placed on Vietnamese content by Facebook after the nation passed a cybersecurity law, the bureaucracy and inefficiency created when governments spend on public goods, and the use of dark advertisements to polarise voters and degrade democracy. In conclusion, opponents of the statement 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government' argue that it is not effective, harms privacy, harms freedom of speech, is an intervention in the affairs of a private company, and can lead to political abuses by the government."
"
In this debate, it is argued that social media platforms should be regulated by the government. The supporters of this claim present five arguments that highlight the benefits of social media regulation. Firstly, regulation would protect the younger audiences, as it would introduce an independent, statutory regulator with the full support of the government to protect people online. Secondly, it can help to tackle the spread of fake news, as it would allow people to discern fact from fiction. Thirdly, social media regulation would make social media platforms more transparent by providing users and legislators insights into the algorithms that determine content visibility. Fourthly, it could help to deal with negative content, by outlawing manipulative techniques used to keep users engaged on the platforms. Finally, it would help to protect against malicious users, as it would reduce the likelihood of stolen information and forced shares. All in all, regulation of social media platforms is necessary in order to provide a safe and secure online environment."

This debate is about the question: Is the USA a good country to live in? The debate is between those who believe the USA is a good country to live in and those who do not believe it is a good country to live in. On one side, those who believe the USA is a good country to live in argue that the country has a lot of advantages that make it a good place to live. On the other side, those who do not believe the USA is a good country to live in argue that the country has many issues such as unfair health and education policies, a problematic/divisive political system, a negative culture, high taxation/costs of living, inequality/poverty, and safety concerns. They also point out that the US is xenophobic/racist. To support their arguments, they cite evidence such as statistics regarding difficulty affording healthcare costs, increasing divisions between political parties, misuse of digital technology and the spread of false information, taxation disparity between cities, high number of homeless, and increasing concern over violent crime. They also mention the reported hate crime incidents and physical attacks on Asian elders since the start of the pandemic. This debate explores the merits of living in the USA and the evidence presented shows that there are many valid points that should be taken into consideration when discussing whether or not the USA is a good country to live in."
"
In the debate about whether the USA is a good country to live in, the affirmative side presents the following arguments and evidence to support their stance. First, the US has a good economy with a per capita income of $56,300 in 2015, one of the highest in the developed world. Second, US universities are highly regarded around the globe and have a 7 of the world’s top 10 universities. Third, the US has a great natural environment with Yosemite being called “nature’s temple” by the famous conservationist and wilderness writer John Muir. Fourth, the US offers citizens the right to basic human rights with the American Declaration of Independence being the first civic document to meet a modern definition of human rights. Fifth, the US has a great culture with influence from all over the world, including English, Indigenous Americans, Latin Americans, Africans and Asians. Sixth, the US is ranked as the world's most powerful country for the seventh time according to rankings by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and US News & World Report. Lastly, the US offers individuals many opportunities with most of the world’s top companies having offices in the USA. In conclusion, the USA is a good country to live in as evidenced by its strong economy, excellent education system, natural environment, human rights, culture, power and opportunities."
"
The debate topic is 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned'. The proponents of this stance argue that the current vow of celibacy should be abandoned. Opponents of this view put forward six claims: that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God; that it is a strong religious belief; that it makes priests to be perceived as holy; that priests choose to be celibates; that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained; and that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts. 

Evidence is provided to support each of these claims. For example, it is argued that by freeing himself from other obligations, a priest is freer to devote himself to God; that Sacerdotalis caelibatus is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI; that the Pope rejects the notion that marriage is the only reasonable path available to a person; and that Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. Additionally, it is argued that four individuals (Theresia, Sr. Agnes, Sr. Elisabeth and Sr. Klara) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty; and that the Archbishop of Vienna has suggested that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals. 

Overall, this debate centers around the pros and cons of the vow of celibacy and whether it should be abandoned. The opponents of this view make the case that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, is a strong religious belief, makes priests to be perceived as holy, is a choice made by priests, should be maintained in order to preserve religious experiences and traditions, and that abandoning it could lead to sexually reckless acts."
"
The debate topic is ‘The vow of celibacy should be abandoned’, with its supporters arguing that it is outdated, too pressuring, unhealthy and unnatural, and it leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Evidence supporting these arguments include the 1540 commutation of the vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity, the difficulty of sexual chemistry for priests, the natural requirement for organisms to reproduce, the 2004 case of sexual abuse in the US Catholic Church, and the priest shortage. Therefore, it is clear that abandoning the vow of celibacy is an important step in allowing for healthier relationships, safer environments, and more priests to serve in the Church."
"
In this debate, we will be discussing whether we should abandon marriage. Those who oppose the idea of abandoning marriage argue that it has a variety of benefits. Firstly, it is beneficial for children as it provides them with gender specific support from having both a mother and a father. This is evidenced by research which suggests that mothers and fathers have particular roles to play in the development of boys and girls. Secondly, marriage is important for people, whether due to religious/traditional reasons, or the fact that it can be a great blessing when it produces a child or receives one through adoption. Thirdly, marriage is known to make people happier, as research suggests that married people are happier than people who are not married. Fourthly, marriage can make the couple closer as married adults are more satisfied and trusting of their partner than those who are cohabiting. Finally, marriage also provides important financial benefits, such as lower taxes and car and home insurance premiums. For these reasons, we should not abandon marriage."
"
The topic of this debate is “We should abandon marriage.” The proponents of this stance posit that marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women, marriages are unstable, marriages tie up people with unfair obligations, and most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship. To support these claims, they cite evidence such as the expectation that women be submissive to male family members, an overall increase in divorce rates since the 1970s, Qatar’s laws requiring women to have male guardian permission to marry and the subsequent lack of rights when a woman is married, and that monogamy is such a dominant approach to love and partnership that it may seem like simply the way relationships work. Therefore, the proponents of the argument put forth that marriage should be abandoned due to the negative consequences it carries for many individuals."
"
In this debate, the topic is 'We should abandon the use of school uniform'. The opponents to this topic argue that children can still express themselves using other means, school uniform reduces bullying, creates a sense of equality/unity, encourages discipline or focus on learning, and saves costs. Evidence supporting these claims includes an oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms” published on PennLive.com, that states uniforms do not stop students from being themselves and the Department of Education finding increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying. It is also argued that uniforms create a sense of unity in terms of community and boost school pride and spirit, and that students in uniform are more focused in their academics, leading to fewer disciplinary problems. Finally, it is argued that using uniforms as opposed to traditional back-to-school clothing can save families up to $1800 per child over a 12-year period."
"
In summary, the debate argues that we should abandon the use of school uniform due to its detrimental effects on student learning, self-expression, finances, comfort, and individualism. According to research, school uniforms are linked to poorer self-perception, a decrease in creativity, a financial burden, a limitation on comfort, and the discouragement of individualism. For example, Tara Maginnis Ph.D. argued that the use of school uniforms violates constitutional rights to free speech and expression. Additionally, a study at Arizona State University discovered that students without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception. Moreover, a GLSEN study showed that 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and 32 percent of transgender students were prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that getting to dress themselves encourages independent thinking and prepares them for adulthood. Therefore, it is important to abandon the use of school uniform to protect the rights of the students."
"
The debate is on whether we should abolish capital punishment or not. Proponents of this position maintain that capital punishment is an inhumane and unacceptable form of punishment, while opponents argue that it helps the victims/their families, is acceptable in cases of severe crimes and it also prevents future crimes. 

Evidence in support of opponents includes a statement from Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina, in which he expressed his support for the bill that will bring back the death penalty in order to provide closure and justice for the victims' families. Further, the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has stated that the death penalty for juveniles is now contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. In addition, David Muhlhausen, a Research Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, argued that studies have demonstrated that capital punishment does, in fact, save lives. 

In conclusion, opponents of abolishing capital punishment contend that it provides justice for the victims and their families, is acceptable in cases of severe crimes and it also prevents future crimes. However, the debate is still ongoing."
"
This debate centers around the topic of whether capital punishment should be abolished. Supporters of the affirmative stance hold that state-sanctioned killing is wrong, as it is applied unfairly and unjustly depending on race and wealth. They further argue that the death penalty disproportionately harms those who are disadvantaged, citing a study from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts which found that the median cost of a federal death penalty case is eight times more expensive than a non-death penalty case. Lastly, they point to the irreversibility of the death penalty, noting that no studies show that it is a deterrent to crime and that it does not prevent crime. With all this in mind, it is time for all nations to abolish capital punishment."
"
The topic of this debate is 'We should abolish intellectual property rights'. The stance for this debate is against the abolition of intellectual property rights, as there are numerous benefits that such rights provide. Firstly, Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) incentivize creativity and innovation by codifying intellectual property for plant breeders to encourage the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society, as stated by UPOV. Secondly, IPRs incentivize investment in developing new products by providing incentives to commercial organisations to produce them. Thirdly, IPRs protect against stealing by providing the necessary protections to ensure Americans' rights in intellectual property are protected. Lastly, IPRs allow people or businesses to own their innovations and be compensated for their endeavour, as IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either for free or with reasonable monetary compensation. In conclusion, IPRs provide numerous benefits that should not be overlooked and hence, should not be abolished."
"
In this debate, we will explore the argument that we should abolish intellectual property rights. Supporters of this stance contend that intellectual property prevents continuous improvement of a service or product, restricts access to important information or products, is unfair, harms creativity and innovation, wastes money, and is ineffective. Evidence for these claims includes the example of Fox Talbot, who by 1852, was accused of hampering the development of photography in England due to his insistence on economic rights to his intellectual property. Professor Lessig’s analysis of piracy and property in the intellectual property realm highlights how multinational corporations have captured the law-making process and only prioritize the accumulation of capital. Additionally, the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is viewed as iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries and poor patients. Furthermore, the cost of obtaining protection for the first time can be expensive and intellectual property is not actually scarce, being more of a legal fiction created by the state. Therefore, the evidence presented suggests that we should abolish intellectual property rights."
"
In this debate, we will be discussing whether or not we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. Opponents to the motion argue that gun control is ineffective, gun ownership is a right, it is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting, and it promotes self-protection. Evidence presented in support of these arguments includes a 2016 study from the Bureau of Justice Statistics which showed that only 10.1% of criminals obtained their firearms from a retail source, a Supreme Court case of District of Columbia v. Heller, which declared gun ownership an individual right, data from 2016 showing that 10 million people used firearms for hunting, and a 2019 Gallup survey which showed that 63% of gun owners cited personal safety as the reason for owning a firearm. Taking all of this into account, it is clear that the opponents of the motion have made convincing arguments."
"
In the debate about whether we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms, the affirmative stance argues that banning guns would save lives, it would lead to less mass shootings and gun violence, guns can fall into the wrong hands, and they can lead to accidental deaths. This is evidenced by a study published in the American Journal of Public Health, which found that “legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death”; a 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, which found that guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance; the tragedy of the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November; and that accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old, with 209 children (age 0-17) having died by gunshot so far in 2022."
"
This debate is about the proposal to adopt an austerity regime. Those against the proposal argue that austerity cuts access to essential services, exacerbates recessions, is unfair to citizens, lowers economic growth, and results in fewer job creations. Evidence for these claims includes reports from the UK National Audit Office, the Health Foundation, and UN rapporteur Philip Alston, as well as economic data from the EU and ECB. Taken together, the evidence suggests that an austerity regime would have a detrimental effect on citizens and the economy."
"
This debate is about the topic of whether or not we should adopt an austerity regime. The pro-austerity stance argues that austerity can improve economic measures, be important in the long term, increase stability, reduce deficits or pay debts, and be necessary in economically troubled times. In support of these claims, evidence suggests that countries like Latvia and Estonia who pursue fiscal austerity have seen a rebound in economic growth, lower debt levels can encourage the private sector to invest, Morocco was a heavily indebted country but austerity measures helped to promote economic stability, a World Bank study found that a debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 77% can slow economic growth, and countries like the UK, Greece, and Spain have used austerity as a way to address budget concerns during the global economic downturn."
"
The debate topic is ""We should adopt atheism"". The stance taken in this debate is that atheism should not be adopted. The opponents argue that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion, lacks morality and ultimately, it should be left to individuals to choose for themselves whether atheism should be adopted or not. In support of this argument, the opponents cite evidence from John Locke, an advocate of tolerance, who urged authorities not to tolerate atheism due to its potential to lead to chaos. Additionally, Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, argues that atheists can behave morally, however, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life. Finally, Liddle states that there is no scientific proof for either option - either God or no God - and it should be a matter of individual choice. Therefore, this debate suggests that atheism should not be adopted."
"
In summary, we should adopt atheism because it is beneficial to the person that adopts it and has no proof that God exists. Religions are immoral and science can adequately explain the Universe, thereby, demonstrating that morality does not come from obedience of a set of rules. Atheism provides us with a superior basis for ethics by allowing us to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves and make moral decisions based on how they affect others."
"
The debate topic is 'We should adopt libertarianism.' Supporters of libertarianism argue that it is an effective way to promote individual autonomy and liberty, while opponents argue that it has serious negative consequences for economic growth, minorities, justice, and the government’s role in protecting citizens’ rights. Supporters of libertarianism claim that market-based solutions can be efficient and just, while opponents point to market failures that can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention. Supporters of libertarianism argue for legalization of what they see as “victimless crimes,” such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution, while opponents of libertarianism maintain that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens, such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. Evidence provided for each stance supports the claim. The 2007 Northern Rock failure and Robert Nozick’s concept of “enslavement contracts” were mentioned as evidence that libertarianism can have harmful economic and justice implications. Furthermore, Joseph Stiglitz’s view on market failures was mentioned to suggest that it can result in unequal outcomes, and a Human Rights Watch report was cited as evidence that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens."
"
In summary, this debate seeks to prove that libertarianism should be adopted. Supporters of the argument suggest that libertarianism would increase economic growth, freedom in the political system, individual happiness and freedoms, and that there is evidence to back this up. Specifically, they cite the work of sustainability advocates Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins, a study by the Cato Institute, and psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, as well as the work of Sunstein and Thaler to support their claims."
"
In conclusion,
The debate is about whether we should ban human cloning. The opponents of this motion argue that cloning can be used for organ replication, it helps those who cannot otherwise have a child, it promotes health, and it promotes science/research. Supporting evidence for these claims include the fact that there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, cloning can help couples struggling with infertility, cloning can be used to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases, and New Jersey and Missouri have legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research."
"
In this debate, I argue that we should ban human cloning due to the potential risks associated with it. First, cloning is not understood enough yet, which is evidenced by Kass's argument that it should not be tolerated as it would lead to the abominable and converting procreation into manufacture. Second, cloning is considered unethical and anti-religious, as stated by Pope John Paul II. Third, it is unnatural, as mentioned by the Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist Rev. Demetri Demopulos. Finally, it is unsafe, which is supported by FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi's warning that it could transfer sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child. All these facts taken together point to a clear conclusion that human cloning should be banned."
"
The debate topic is ‘We should ban private military companies.’ Those against the proposition argue that hiring private military companies is financially beneficial, better trained and equipped, and that they can supplement regular armies in specific tasks. Additionally, they argue that private military companies increase safety. Evidence for these claims include a study in 2011 which found that private military companies can provide more efficient services, a 2009 report which found that private military companies offer specialized training programs, and a 2010 report which found that private military companies can provide more efficient use of resources, reducing the overall cost of military operations and allowing for a greater focus on safety."
"
The debate is about whether we should ban private military companies. The stance of the positive supporters of the ban is that private military companies are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes, are not professional, cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country, have a main interest of profit, and solicit engaging, or prolonging, conflict. Supporting evidence includes a report by the United Nations in 2004 that found evidence of private military companies using child soldiers in conflict zones, a report by Amnesty International in 2009 that found private military companies have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, a study published in the Journal of Military Ethics in 2009 that found private military companies can face a conflict of interest if they have loyalty to multiple countries, a study published in the journal International Affairs in 2010 that found private military companies often operate with limited accountability, and a report by the Project on Government Oversight in 2008 that found private military companies have a financial incentive to prolong conflicts. With such evidence, it is clear that banning private military companies is the right decision."
"
The debate topic is ""We should ban the use of child actors"". The opponents argue against the idea of banning child actors by providing evidence for their claims that acting may be the child's dream, that child performers achieve success and confidence, that child performers are necessary for roles, that child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation, and that the parents should decide for their child. Evidence supporting these claims includes a report by the Drama Teachers Association of America in 2011 which found that some children and young people have a natural talent for acting and may pursue this as a career due to their abilities, Ashwin Chitale winning the best child artist award, a report by the National Association of Theatre Owners in 2013 finding that casting children in various roles can increase the diversity in casting and provide opportunities for more actors, including children, Walsh appearing with the segments' usual roster of child actors to help illustrate scenarios in which children could often be in danger, and solutions they could seek, and a study published in the Journal of Family Psychology in 2013 finding that parents are able to provide individualized attention and care for their children, and that this is important for the child's development and well-being. Therefore, opponents of the ban on the use of child actors provide evidence that this should not be prohibited."
"
This debate is about the proposition of banning the use of child actors. The affirmative side argues that being a performer harms the child's education, as evidenced by a 2013 study published in the Journal of Education and Practice which found that child performers often miss school or receive inadequate education, leading to a lack of basic skills and knowledge. Furthermore, child performers are at risk of exploitation, as a 2012 study published in the Journal of Adolescence found that they are often subject to labor violations such as wage theft, lack of breaks, and poor working conditions. The pressure of being a child actor can also lead to the loss of childhood, as evidenced by a 2016 report by UNICEF that found child actors are often exposed to unhealthy working conditions, leading to the loss of their childhood. Additionally, child actors may experience mental health issues due to the pressure and stress associated with their work, as shown by a 2014 study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence. Lastly, a lack of identity when they reach puberty and are no longer of commercial value may lead to difficulties adjusting to the real world, as demonstrated by Herbert's case. All of these points clearly suggest that the use of child actors should be banned."
"
The topic of this debate is 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp'. The stance that will be argued against this is that we should not close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, as it would be harmful to national security, it is better for prisoners than the alternatives, and is essential to gain intelligence. As evidence, we have found that 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities, and an estimated 12.7 percent of all former Guantanamo detainees are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. We have also found that the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world. Additionally, it is also essential to gain intelligence, as it was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror, providing an opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts operations. Therefore, we should not close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp."
"
In summary, supporters of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp claim that detainees have the right to trial in US courts, supported by the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Boumediene v. Bush. It is also argued that the camp harms US image/reputation/institutions, is a symbol of discrimination/injustice, is expensive, personnel commit crimes against prisoners, and unjust treatment/tactics are used. This is evidenced by the camp serving as a recruiting tool for terrorists, its catastrophic failures, its high cost of maintenance, and the use of various harsh interrogation techniques, among others."
"
This debate focuses on the topic of whether we should end affirmative action. The opponents of ending affirmative action put forth three claims and supporting evidence: (1) affirmative action boosts diversity, (2) it is necessary to compensate for the past, and (3) it reduces discrimination. For the first claim, opponents point to a study which found that students of color experienced a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect. For the second claim, opponents cite the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights definition of affirmative action as ""any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future."" Finally, opponents of ending affirmative action note that the Supreme Court upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories. Ultimately, opponents of ending affirmative action argue that affirmative action is necessary to reduce discrimination, boost diversity, and compensate for the past."
"
This debate will discuss whether or not we should end affirmative action. Supporters of this stance argue that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Evidence to support this includes that some opponents believe it is counter-productive, as in 2010 Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107. Additionally, Asian-American students, who have top test scores, are marked down on “personality trait” testing and thus are not being given the chance to attend a prestigious university. Furthermore, opponents claim that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination' and that it has undesirable side-effects, as well as sweeping the systemic problems of economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children under the carpet. Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, also argued that these programs reduce quality. From this evidence, we can conclude that affirmative action should be ended."
"
The debate question is: Should we end mandatory retirement? Taking the stance that we should end mandatory retirement, the debate script will argue that a mandatory retirement age does not create new employment opportunities, and does not provide any financial benefits for those that are about to be retired. 

Argument 1: Mandatory retirement does not create new employment opportunities. The International Labour Organization’s 2012 report found that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people. However, this report does not take into consideration other factors that can contribute to the employment rate. It does not provide evidence that this effect is large or long-lasting, meaning that other policies are needed to truly make a difference in the rate of employment.

Argument 2: Mandatory retirement does not provide any financial benefits for those that are about to be retired. The Employee Benefit Research Institute’s 2010 report found that mandatory retirement ages can increase financial security for workers. However, this report does not take into account other sources of income or retirement savings. Furthermore, this report does not provide any evidence that the financial security that is created is long-lasting, or that it is worth the loss of income and potential job opportunities for those that are forced to retire early. 

In conclusion, it is clear that mandatory retirement does not create new employment opportunities or provide any financial benefits for those that are about to be retired. For these reasons, we should end mandatory retirement."

In summary, we should end mandatory retirement as it decreases institutional knowledge, harms the economy, is not fair or discriminatory, reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire and allows people to retire when they are ready. Evidence for these claims include that there is no mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers in the UK, a study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that mandatory retirement ages can impede workforce diversity, a report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can result in age discrimination, evidence from Social Security Eligibility by Jonathan Gruber and David Wise, published in The American Economic Review, found that health declines after mandatory retirement, and the same report found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging."
"    - Evidence 2: Nuclear weapons play a significant role in deterring conventional and chemical weapons attacks.

The topic of the debate is: “We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons”. The stance of the opponents is that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. In support of their stance, they have provided two evidence. Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years. Evidence 2: Nuclear weapons play a significant role in deterring conventional and chemical weapons attacks. 

To summarize, the opponents of the motion argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence and they have presented two pieces of evidence to support their stance. The first evidence shows that deterrence has been a successful tool for maintaining peace for almost 70 years. The second evidence states that nuclear weapons are effective in deterring conventional and chemical weapons attacks."
"
Summary: The debate focuses on the topic 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons'. Supporters of the topic argue that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands and provoke or escalate disastrous military action. As evidence, recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Additionally, the Pentagon has estimated that if there was a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, there would have been 375 million deaths in Russia, China and other countries due to nuclear fallout and Russian short-range missiles. Therefore, the topic of abolition of nuclear weapons should be taken seriously in order to prevent further nuclear disaster."

The debate topic is ""We should fight urbanization"", and the opposition claims that urbanization offers more opportunities, benefits the economy, and benefits the environment. Evidence for the opposing stance suggests that migration to urban areas is usually motivated by a hope of better lives, that new government policies have encouraged urbanisation in China's rural population, and that urbanization drives innovation in green technologies. While the evidence presented does support the opposing stance, it is not enough to conclude that urbanization should not be fought against. 

Urbanization should not be viewed as a completely negative process. However, unchecked urbanization can lead to negative consequences such as overcrowding, increased air pollution, and a strain on public infrastructure and services. Furthermore, while the economic benefits of urbanization are undeniable, it should also be taken into consideration that urbanization often displaces rural people, leading to an increase in poverty levels. Additionally, while green technology may be one of the outcomes of urbanization, without sufficient oversight and regulations, cities can end up becoming hubs of pollution and environmental degradation. 

In conclusion, it is not enough to argue that urbanization should not be fought against, due to the potential negative consequences of unchecked urbanization. Therefore, it is important to ensure that any urbanization is done in a responsible and sustainable manner."
"
In this debate, those who argue for fighting urbanization state that restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically and socially, that urbanization causes crime, harms the environment, and strains cities' resources. As evidence, Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; MÄori leaders and government policymakers have struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems; increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies; and a UNESCO report detailed low levels of living, inadequate housing, lack of sanitary facilities, filth, and high mortality and a lack of educational facilities. Therefore, we should fight urbanization in order to protect the people in the rural areas, reduce crime, protect the environment, and ensure cities have access to the resources they need."
"
In this debate, the topic is whether we should introduce compulsory voting. Those opposing the stance argue that abstaining from a vote is also reflecting preferences, citizens have a right not to vote, compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, and not everyone has the ability to go to vote. To support their arguments, evidence is provided which states that abstention can be used to indicate ambivalence or mild disapproval, compelled speech act violates freedom of speech, uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending, and people may be voting based on intentional disinformation. In conclusion, compulsory voting may be difficult to enforce and can have unintended consequences, and thus is a complicated issue that deserves further consideration."
"
In this debate, we will be discussing whether we should introduce compulsory voting. The positive supporters of this stance argue that compulsory voting increases representation, causes people to become more interested in politics, and people have an obligation to vote. Evidence to support this stance includes a report by Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne Jr. that highlights the disparities in turnout between different groups, suggesting that boosting turnout is a matter of justice and representation. Additionally, it has been argued that compulsory voting increases the political education of the people, and the European Court of Human Rights ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms. In conclusion, the positive stance argues that compulsory voting is a valid measure to increase turnout, representation, and political engagement."
"
In the debate over whether we should legalize cannabis, the opponents argue that cannabis harms the body, increases lack-of-judgement/accidents, is a gateway-drug/addictive, can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children, and will boost the black-market/criminal activity. 

Evidence of cannabis' potential harms to the body include a 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore that found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Anslinger, a US government official, also claimed that cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. 

The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) argues that the chemical THC in cannabis triggers brain cells to release dopamine, which leads to addiction. Gordon Brown, former prime minister of the United Kingdom, has also argued against reclassifying cannabis in any way that could make it more acceptable to teenagers, as this could have serious consequences.

Finally, even in states where cannabis has been legalized, large illegal operations have still been found. For instance, in California, 20 tons of cannabis were confiscated off farms, an $8 million worth of plants was found in a warehouse, and over 100 illegal operations were busted in Anza. 

All of this evidence strongly suggests that legalizing cannabis could have serious and potentially devastating consequences, and therefore should not be legalized."
"
In summary, the debate for the legalization of cannabis is based on the idea that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal, as well as on the potential financial and health benefits of cannabis, including reducing criminal activity and respecting the right of individuals to do whatever they want to their own bodies. Supporters of this topic present evidence that marijuana has caused only two possible drug-induced deaths compared to the half a million deaths caused by legal drugs, that cannabis can be financially beneficial, and that it is safe, pain-relieving, and could be regulated. They also point out that downgrading cannabis to class C in the UK had reduced usage in the 16-24 age group, and that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking. Lastly, they cite John Stuart Mill's harm principle to argue that individuals should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies."
"
In the debate concerning whether prostitution should be legalized or not, opponents of legalization argue that such a policy would lead to an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, immoral behavior such as pimping, trafficking and organized crime, and violence against women. In addition, they point out that selling one's body is morally wrong. Evidence to support these claims includes a survey conducted in Athens in the late 1980s which found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive, a report written in 2005 that found that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and abused, and the unintended consequences of the proposed legislation in Sweden which increased the risk of violence and harmed the most vulnerable. Furthermore, feminists argue that prostitution is a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it."
"
The debate topic is ""We should legalize prostitution"". It is argued that legalizing prostitution would boost the economy, increase sex workers' benefits, allow for regulation of those in the profession, make it safer for women, and be a valid choice over one's own body. Historical evidence such as the belief of Seattle's founder David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy, and the Dutch policy of tolerating prostitution for harm reduction purposes, are used to support the argument. A 2009 study on the subjective well-being of prostitutes also found that among those surveyed, sex work had become normalized. This suggests that legalizing prostitution would bring forth numerous benefits."
"
This debate is about whether we should legalize sex selection. The opponents of this motion argue that it could lead to gender imbalance, reaffirm gender stereotypes/biases, and create abortions/infanticide. Evidence in support of these claims shows that in countries such as India and China, having boys is preferred over having girls, leading to a ratio of men to women that is unbalanced. This reinforces gender stereotypes and can lead to female infanticide under compulsory measures like the one-child policy in China."
"
The topic of this debate is 'We should legalize sex selection', with the positive stance that it should be legalized. Supporters of this stance argue that legalizing sex selection is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child; it allows for better family planning, makes the family more happy/complete, prevents diseases in the child and will prevent abortions/infanticide. Evidence supporting these claims includes the fact that people have slight preferences for a specific gender, it offers effective control over the number of children wanted, it allows for parents to adopt offspring of a particular sex, and it can prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Ultimately, it allows intended parents to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer."
"
In conclusion, the debate topic of 'We should prohibit flag burning' is supported by the opponents. The arguments put forth by the opponents is that flag burning is an effective tool of expression, protest and critique, and that it is justified due to the freedom of expression. Evidence to support the arguments include the 1984 court ruling in favor of Gregory Lee Johnson, in which Justice Brennan ruled that flag burning is an act of expression and thus protected by the First Amendment."
"
This debate is about whether or not flag burning should be prohibited. The stance of those in favor of prohibiting flag burning is that flags are important symbols that should be respected, and that flag burning is an inflammatory act. To support this claim, Warren held the opinion that laws against flag burning are constitutional. Additionally, proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed."
"
Summary: This debate is about whether or not women should be prohibited from serving in combat. The opponents of the motion argue that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men, that they are an asset in combat, that they bring unique skills and strategies, and that they can be just as capable in combat as men. Additionally, they contend that women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to and that they should be accepted as long as they pass the necessary tests. This is supported by evidence such as the principle of equal pay for equal work enshrined in the European Treaties, the roles of women in the military since the Revolutionary War, the leadership skills demonstrated by women in the military, the success of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, and the introduction of Physical Employment Standards and Role Fitness Tests by the Army."
"
The topic of the debate is 'We should prohibit women in combat'. Supporters of this position argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women due to biological differences in size, strength, and aerobic capacity; that women are unable to overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers; that women can be a distraction or harm the functioning of the military; that women should serve in safer roles; and that women soldier capture is a big concern. 

Evidence provided in support of this argument includes: that women are generally physically smaller than men with less bone mass and muscle density, making it harder for them to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness; the British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units; Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced concerns that men would be distracted by the sight of women in harm's way; in 2014 the IDF noted that fewer than 4 percent of women were in combat positions such as infantry, artillery, and fighter pilots; and that women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men."
"
This debate is about whether we should subsidize journalism. Proponents argue that subsidizing journalism can benefit the public by promoting the flow of truthful information. Opponents claim that subsidizing journalism has the risk of inserting bias or harming objectivity, it is preferable to spend the money elsewhere, and journalism is like every other business and should not be bailed out if it is unsustainable. They cite evidence such as that political endorsements create opportunities for favoritism and bias, postal subsidies from the nation's early founding are no longer relevant with the number of communication mediums now available, and that the federal government can't afford to bail out newspapers, as they have already bailed out undeserving banks and automobile manufacturers."
"
This debate concerns the question of whether we should subsidize journalism. Supporters of the motion argue that a subsidy is important to make journalism viable; that journalism is important to information-spreading and accountability; that subsidies will increase the quality of journalism; and that subsidies will increase objectivity in reporting. In order to substantiate these claims, supporters of the motion have highlighted evidence that shows that, due to the availability of digital tools such as blogs, it has become difficult to distinguish fact from fiction; that the Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient in providing accurate and factual reporting on state and national events; that the International Federation of Journalists launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative to defend standards and promote quality journalism; and that peace journalism may help expose violent groups by presenting local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism. From this evidence, we can conclude that subsidies should be allocated to journalism to ensure its viability, promote information-spreading and accountability, increase its quality, and increase objectivity in reporting."
"
In the debate on whether we should subsidize space exploration, one side argues that it should be left to the private sector, citing the success of SpaceX in providing services for NASA and the immense costs of space travel, as well as the ineffectiveness of past space exploration projects. On the other side, it is argued that there are more pressing matters on which funds should be spent, such as poverty. The evidence provided shows that the cost of space travel is high and that the projects to date have produced limited scientific advances, as well as highlighting the tragedy of global poverty."
"
In conclusion, the positive stance for subsidizing space exploration is well-supported by five claims, each with evidence to back it. Space exploration can help colonize other planets, improve science and technology, be financially beneficial, be necessary for humanity’s survival, and unravel information about the universe. Therefore, space exploration should be subsidized as it can bring many advantages to the world."
"
The debate topic is 'We should subsidize vocational education'. The proponents argue that subsidizing vocational education can help improve job prospects and economic growth while its opponents counter that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes, is expensive, leads to an influx in those professions and is not a good career choice. To support their claims, opponents cite evidence from the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Center for American Progress, and the National Center for Education and the Economy. Their evidence suggests that subsidizing vocational education can be expensive and divert money from other important programs; it can lead to an influx in those professions, making it difficult for workers to transition to new careers or industries; and it is not a good career choice due to its limited transferability of skills.  In conclusion, while subsidizing vocational education can offer some benefits, its opponents suggest that it may not be the best use of resources."
"
The debate topic is: ""We should subsidize vocational education"". The affirmative side of this debate believes that subsidizing vocational education will be beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. The first argument is that subsidizing vocational education can promote those with fewer resources, as found in a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019. The second argument is that vocational education better fits many students, according to a study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in 2020. The third argument is that vocational education is a good career choice, according to a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022. Lastly, the fourth argument is that vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society, as demonstrated by a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019. The evidence shows that subsidizing vocational education can help promote those with fewer resources, provide a more direct path to employment, offer training and education for high-demand jobs, and address workforce shortages. Therefore, the affirmative side of this debate strongly believes that subsidizing vocational education is beneficial for individuals and society as a whole."
