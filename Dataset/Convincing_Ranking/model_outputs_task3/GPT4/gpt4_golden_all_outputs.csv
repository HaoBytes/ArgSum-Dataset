"Opponents of the proposition argue against criminalizing assisted suicide, framing it as a matter of dignity, personal choice, and compassion. They assert that the dignity of an individual can be upheld through assisted suicide. This argument is supported by the fact that many organizations and laws related to assisted suicide incorporate the word 'dignity' reflecting a shared understanding of the act as a possible expression of personal autonomy at the end of life. They also cite statements from notable figures like Jack Kevorkian and advocacy groups like Dignity in Dying to corroborate their viewpoint. Additionally, a qualitative study from the UK lends weight to this claim, revealing strong public support for legalizing assisted suicide based on the desire to avoid pain, loss of control, and cognitive impairment. The opponents further argue that assisted suicide reduces suffering, with evidence from New Mexico's judicial system and Dutch law underlining the potential legality of the act under certain conditions. They highlight reports showing that the availability of assisted suicide can offer peace of mind, even if patients ultimately choose a natural death. Asserting that people should have the right to choose their end, opponents draw on examples of legal frameworks such as in the Netherlands and the use of Advanced Decisions to substantiate their claim. A desire for a 'good death' is presented as a valid choice for seriously and incurably ill adults, providing a way for them to maintain control over their fate. Lastly, opponents claim that terminally ill individuals stand to benefit from assisted suicide. Poll data from Ireland and personal accounts from public figures like Terry Pratchett support this argument. This claim is also backed by philosophical and ethical considerations, suggesting that when pain or suffering becomes unbearable, death can be a preferable alternative."
"Supporters of the proposition argue that assisted suicide should be considered a criminal offense due to ethical and medical concerns. They claim that assisted suicide can enable individuals to exploit someone else’s death for personal benefit, with evidence derived from certain regulations requiring a long-term doctor-patient relationship and permanent residency to limit potential misuse. The supporters emphasize the potential for recovery among patients, arguing that considerations like depression or worry about being a burden should not justify assisted suicide. They argue that these might be signs that more could be done to help the patient, implying that the medical community should focus more on healing rather than hastening death. They contend that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role as a healer, a perspective voiced by medical professionals like Dr. Lynda Young. Legal precedents from New York also echo this argument, reinforcing the idea that a doctor's purpose is to preserve life rather than end it. Supporters claim that individuals do not have the right to self-harm or harm others, backed by Irish laws and U.S. court rulings against the constitutional right to assisted suicide. The New Zealand Medical Association's stance against voluntary euthanasia is also mentioned as evidence of professional ethical opposition to the practice. Lastly, they posit that individuals suffering from illness may not have clear judgment, asserting the need for greater assistance and care. They suggest that allowing assisted suicide could potentially lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of vulnerable individuals, indicating a slippery slope argument. The idea here is that legalizing assisted suicide could incrementally lead to more extreme practices, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia, which are currently deemed unacceptable."
"Opponents of banning homeschooling offer multiple arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they highlight that homeschooling is often the most suitable option for catering to the unique needs of exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students (Claim 1). For example, Eastern York Schools and Lebanon School District offer services such as special education, combined purchasing, and instructional technology to homeschooled students. Additionally, homeschooling can benefit families living in remote locations, or those pursuing unusual lifestyles, like families of young athletes or actors. Secondly, opponents argue that homeschooling can be tailored to a child's pace and individual needs (Claim 2). They note that homeschooling allowed Ryan Gosling, a famous actor, to maintain his sense of autonomy. Nelson pointed out the benefits of personalized education, stating that it boosts children's engagement and helps them discover their strengths. Homeschooling also allows children to learn real-life skills and experience different environments, such as museums or science centers. The third argument concerns the issues with mainstream schools, such as violence and bullying (Claim 3). Homeschoolers often choose this path to protect their children from these problems and to create a more personalized learning environment. Opponents also assert that parents should have the freedom to choose their children's education (Claim 4). They cite Rep. Franklin, an opponent of public schools, who stated that homeschooling and private schooling are better alternatives. Homeschooling allows parents to be more involved in their children's education progress and explore their own family's culture without the constraints of government systems. Finally, they argue that the home environment is an excellent learning platform (Claim 5). They note that home-educated students tend to be more mature and have broader socialization experiences, offering more active learning environments."
"Supporters of banning homeschooling posit that homeschools cannot be adequately regulated or standardized (Claim 1). For instance, they mention the case of Vyckie Garrison, who couldn't provide a quality education for her children due to the lack of regulation. Furthermore, they suggest that without oversight and regulation, there's potential for child abuse and educational neglect. The second argument presented is that mainstream schools are essential for developing social skills (Claim 2). They suggest that homeschooling could lead to children being out of touch with their peers and having less exposure to diverse backgrounds. They reference a 20-year study, which showed a correlation between a child's social skills and their future success. The third argument asserts that mainstream schools often offer a higher quality of education (Claim 3). Supporters reference the European Court of Human Rights upholding the German ban on homeschooling, stating that education requires state regulation. They also mention that public school teachers are often more experienced and equipped to teach. The fourth claim suggests that parents are not necessarily qualified to teach (Claim 4). They argue that homeschooling might limit children's perspectives, as parents may unintentionally propagate a biased worldview. Also, they note that homeschooling involves administrative work and preparing children for exams, which could add to parental stress. In conclusion, the debate around banning homeschooling encompasses diverse views and angles, including the value of personalized learning and parental choice, versus the need for standardized education and societal interaction. Each side provides compelling arguments backed by evidence, leading to a complex and nuanced discussion."
"The opposition to the mandatory routine vaccination of children brings forth several arguments and evidence. Firstly, they suggest that routine child vaccinations may lead to harmful side effects. The CDC has reported instances where vaccines like the chickenpox vaccine can cause pneumonia, and a small possibility exists that the flu vaccine may result in Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, occurring in approximately one to two out of a million vaccinated individuals. Furthermore, the Rotashield vaccine for rotavirus had to be withdrawn from the market after its introduction due to potentially causing a higher incidence of bowel obstructions. The second claim is that mandatory vaccination contradicts fundamental rights. According to the opponents, the First Amendment of the US Constitution prevents laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion, which may extend to the refusal of vaccination on religious grounds. Also, they argue that compulsory vaccination infringes on the human right of bodily integrity, a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Lastly, opponents contend that routine vaccinations are not necessary for maintaining children's health. Citing the Mayo Clinic, they argue that natural infection often provides more comprehensive immunity than a series of vaccinations."
"Supporters of mandatory routine vaccinations for children argue for their effectiveness. They highlight that vaccinations prevent two to three million deaths annually worldwide, with a potential for more if all recommended vaccines are used. They provide historical data showing drastic decreases in deaths from diseases like polio, smallpox, diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella, thanks to vaccines. The significant reduction in polio cases globally, from 350,000 in 1988 to 500 in 2014, is noted as a significant achievement of vaccination programs. Next, supporters argue that child vaccinations save lives, with the World Health Organization estimating that vaccination prevents 3.5-5 million deaths per year. They present data showing that vaccination of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections. Moreover, vaccines save approximately 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, according to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization. Vaccinations are also necessary to protect others, argue the supporters. They emphasize the concept of herd immunity, noting that outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur when the vaccination rate within a population is over 92%. They provide examples of outbreaks caused by unvaccinated individuals, showing that the protection of public health can supersede personal freedom, as upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts. Supporters further argue that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading, highlighting again the role of herd immunity. They point to the success of the smallpox vaccine, which eradicated a disease that had been killing a significant proportion of infected adults and children. Lastly, supporters argue that children should not suffer from preventable diseases. The World Health Organization has observed that vaccine-preventable diseases cause an estimated three million deaths each year, a tragedy that could be averted with more extensive vaccination. Supporters also point to the dangers of vaccine hesitancy, which the World Health Organization categorizes as one of the top ten global health threats, and can lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases, as seen with the increase in measles cases worldwide in 2019."
"Opponents to this topic present a number of robust arguments and evidence. Their first argument posits that social media regulation is not effective. They back this claim with several pieces of evidence. They reference the Federal Trade Commission's failure to enforce an order, resulting in the unlawful transfer of 87 million user records, which they argue imperils privacy and democracy. They also discuss the fine TikTok paid for violating children's privacy law, pointing out that the platform was still collecting children's personal information without consent. Further evidence is the inadequacy of California's Senate Bill No. 1001, intended to tackle the role of bots in fake news and advertising, as well as the noticeable gap in legislation holding platforms accountable for data privacy management. They also highlight the European General Data Protection Regulation (G.D.P.R.), citing the little action taken against Facebook and Google since its implementation. The second claim made by opponents of government regulation on social media is that it harms privacy. They refer to the government use of Social Media Monitoring Software (SMMS), which they argue can infrally track, monitor, and chart out individual activities and networks. They also call out the Department of Homeland Security's policy of using personal information collected from social media platforms to screen immigrants. The opponents argue that the majority of the public feel their potential risks due to data collection by companies and government outweigh the benefits and they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information. Opponents then assert that social media regulation can harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights. To support this, they highlight warnings from the Open Rights Group and the Index on Censorship about the potential threat to freedom of expression. They also refer to the criticism towards tighter restrictions under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as violations of the First Amendment. The evidence here suggests that nearly every country adopting laws relating to online content jeopardizes human rights, as seen with Peggy Hicks' statement, and the censorship situation in Vietnam following the passage of a cybersecurity law in 2018. Their fourth claim is that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, arguing that government intervention can lead to bureaucracy and inefficiency, and can disrupt market systems that have a natural tendency to adjust and equalize. Finally, opponents assert that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government. They cite instances of the suppression of Palestinian voices during violence in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and how government regulation to prevent the spread of misinformation is susceptible to political co-optation. They also note instances where political pressures influenced public information, such as the altering of weather reports, and the manipulation of social media as an information weapon, as seen in the US 2016 elections and the political advertisements targeting minority communities. In summary, opponents of government regulation on social media argue that such regulation is ineffective, harms privacy, threatens freedom of speech, interferes with the operation of private companies, and can be co-opted for political abuses. They substantiate these claims with a variety of evidence from real-world instances of ineffective regulation, the detrimental impact on privacy, the potential suppression of free speech, the adverse effects of government intervention, and examples of political manipulation."
"Supporters of this proposition advance several compelling arguments, underpinned by substantial evidence. Firstly, they assert that social media regulation protects younger audiences. Section 230 was enacted by Congress to promote First Amendment and e-commerce interests, but also to safeguard minors. Furthermore, groups like EPIC have filed complaints urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and penalize platforms like TikTok for violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). This law gives parents control over the information collected about their children under 13 years old on these platforms. Anecdotal evidence, such as the case of Molly Russell, a young British teenager whose distressing social media feeds allegedly contributed to her death, reinforces the need for regulation. The necessity for an independent, statutory regulator with government backing, rather than self-regulation, was underscored by Lamb. Secondly, proponents argue that regulation is necessary to combat fake news. They cite the stance of Margrethe Vestager, a European Commission executive, advocating for transparency in content moderation to prevent the spread of dangerous disinformation. Legislation like the Digital Services Act in the EU forces platforms to combat misinformation and disclose their content promotion policies. Public faith in news accuracy is waning, with only 37% believing news organizations generally get the facts straight, highlighting the need for intervention. The widespread dissemination of fake content during the presidential campaign, as demonstrated by Facebook and Twitter statistics, further underscores this point. The third argument posits that social media regulation is beneficial to society at large. The Chinese government has utilized social media to release accurate pandemic information and refute false COVID-19 rumors, demonstrating potential societal benefits. However, without regulation, social media can also exacerbate societal problems like political polarization, extremism, and mental health issues. Pending legislation in the EU aims to make platforms more transparent and eliminate manipulative techniques, aiming for societal benefit. The fourth contention is that regulation can address negative content on social media. Proposed legislation like Senator Amy Klobuchar's aims to restrict social media algorithms' spread of harmful material. The European Union's Digital Services Act intends to hold companies accountable for policing illicit content on their platforms. Further support comes from tech leaders like Richard Pursey who state that online safety is a fundamental human right and government regulation is the way forward. Lastly, advocates argue that regulation is necessary to handle malicious users. This argument is substantiated by instances like the Cambridge Analytica scandal where private information from Facebook was exploited to influence the 2016 American presidential election. According to Pew Trust, 13% of Americans have had their social media accounts hijacked, and incidents like the Russian operation Internet Research Agency meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election demonstrate the harm that can be done. In conclusion, the supporters of government regulation of social media platforms bring forth a robust argument in its favor, substantiated by a multitude of evidences, and covering various areas from the protection of minors to the necessity of countering disinformation."
"Opponents make several compelling claims about the challenges faced by citizens due to systemic issues. Claim 1 asserts that the US has unfair health and education policies, substantiated by evidence like racial bias in education (with white teachers often providing less constructive feedback to Black or Latino students), and health insurance disparities. This results in significant portions of the population, particularly Black and Hispanic adults, as well as uninsured individuals, struggling to afford healthcare costs. Opponents' second claim posits that the US has a divisive political system. This is demonstrated through the polarized perspectives that emerged during the 2020 presidential election and differing views on significant national issues such as the economy, racial justice, and climate change. Moreover, the nation's division was palpable during the coronavirus outbreak, where perceptions on the government's response were starkly different between Republicans and Democrats. The third claim, that the US has a negative culture, is supported with evidence pointing to a pervasive 'hustle culture' that glorifies overwork and dismisses leisure, misuse of digital technology, and an apparent lack of respect for one another within the society. Fourthly, the high cost of living and taxation is seen as problematic. Demonstrated by the struggles of families living near the poverty line in areas like Manhattan being taxed higher than those with similar standards of living in less expensive cities. Furthermore, increases in spending on necessities like housing and healthcare are outpacing income growth, putting additional financial pressure on families. Claim 5 draws attention to the issue of inequality and poverty, evidenced by the significant homelessness rates, high child poverty levels compared to other wealthy nations, and concentrated wealth in the hands of the top 10% of households. The United States' Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, is comparable to countries like Bulgaria and Turkey, suggesting a significant wealth gap. The opponents' sixth claim suggests that the US is unsafe, as indicated by public concerns about violent crime, increasing feelings of insecurity compared to five years ago, and alarmingly high rates of gun-related deaths. The country's ranking for general quality of life also slipped due to safety concerns. Finally, the seventh claim points out xenophobia and racism in the US. Arguments exist that white supremacy has been present in the U.S. school curriculum for centuries, negatively impacting non-White students. This systemic racism extends beyond education, with examples provided, such as racial slurs against Asian Americans and the poorer health profiles of middle-class Black Americans due to racialized trauma. In sum, opponents argue that the United States' systemic issues in health and education policy, divisive political landscape, pervasive negative culture, high cost of living, inequality, safety concerns, and issues of racism and xenophobia make the country a less than ideal place to live."
"The proponents of the argument that 'The USA is a good country to live in' put forth several significant claims supported by strong evidence. They begin with the claim that the US has a robust economy and high standard of living. Evidence in support of this includes a comparison of the per capita income, which was $56,300 in 2015 - one of the highest in the developed world. Joseph Sullivan in a column for National Review also highlights that between 2016 and 2019, economic growth in the U.S. was the best among its peers, surpassing other nations such as Finland and Sweden. Moreover, with 67% of people aged 15 to 64 having a paid job, the employment rate in the US is slightly above the OECD average. The second claim is that the US has exemplary health and education systems. The US ranks 8th in the United Nations Human Development Index which measures health, education, and per capita income levels. A significant proportion of adults aged 25-64 (92%) have completed upper secondary education, which is higher than the OECD average of 79%. Moreover, the US education system is globally respected, with 40 out of 100 top universities located in the country, according to a 2014 survey. Third, the argument posits that the US boasts an impressive environment and nature. The estimated value of natural resources in the U.S. is substantial at $45 trillion, with coal and timber making up a large proportion of this. The country also hosts a diverse range of landscapes and natural wonders, ranging from the Rocky Mountains to the Grand Canyon, and is home to an impressive variety of wildlife. The fourth claim advocates for the democratic rights and freedoms prevalent in the US. According to 'Human Rights: The Essential Reference,' the American Declaration of Independence was the first civic document to define modern human rights. In addition, citizens enjoy the right to peaceful public protest, as guaranteed by the First Amendment. In terms of culture, proponents argue that the US is rich and diverse, greatly influencing the rest of the world. The US is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world due to the influences of Indigenous Americans, Latin Americans, Africans, Asians, and English settlers who colonized the country in the 1600s. This diversity has led to the United States being described as a 'melting pot' of cultures. Additionally, the argument highlights the country's global power, ranking as the world's most powerful country according to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and US News & World Report. The US's economic, military, and cultural dominance underscore this position, making it a leader in the global order. Finally, the US offers ample opportunities for individuals, especially in the job market. The Department of Labor reports that there are about 9.8 million job vacancies, with job growth surging in recent months, providing unmatched career opportunities. Consequently, proponents argue that the abundant job opportunities and the presence of offices of almost all major global companies make the US a land of unique opportunities."
"Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God: Opponents claim that celibacy allows priests to devote their lives completely to God, free from the obligations and distractions of family life. Eusebius of Caesarea, a leading figure in the Council, argued that those serving God should abstain from marital relations. This view was echoed by Paul VI, who said that celibacy enables a closer relationship with God and that it is sustained by divine grace. Moreover, Garry Wills in his book 'Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit' argued that celibacy played a pivotal role in establishing the Church as an influential institution. Clerical celibacy, according to advocates, is a special gift allowing ministers to be closer to Christ and dedicate themselves more freely to God and their neighbour. Celibacy is a strong religious belief: Opposition to abandoning celibacy is rooted in the historical and spiritual traditions of the church. Gray, for example, held a series of councils between 1241 and 1255 enforcing clerical celibacy and improving clergy education. Clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' from the church's beginnings, seen as a spiritual marriage with Christ, a view popularized by early Christian theologian Origen. Moreover, mandatory celibacy became canon law in 1074 under Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate corruption. Celibacy makes priests to be perceived as holy: The opponents argue that celibacy helps foster the perception of priests as holy figures. Pope's upholding of celibacy presents it as not just an alternative to marriage, but a different form of love that is equally demanding and genuine. In 387 or 390, a Council of Carthage decreed that those serving divine sacraments should observe perfect continence, a practice that was seen to heighten their spiritual purity. Priests choose to be celibate: The opposition underscores that celibacy is a personal choice made by those who join the priesthood. As Laurent Cleenewerck, an Orthodox Church priest, indicates, celibacy was favored and viewed as a gift by Paul. Some nuns and priests, such as Sr. Theresia and Sr. Agnes, among others, willingly took vows of celibacy. Philippe Delhaye noted that for the first few centuries, clerical marriage was not prohibited; celibacy was a personal choice. Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained: The opponents also argue that religious traditions, including celibacy, should be preserved. They cite Pope Siricius, who asserted in the 4th century that clerical sexual abstinence was an apostolic practice that should be upheld. Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts: The opponents claim that abandoning celibacy might lead to sexually reckless behavior. This argument is supported by reports suggesting that celibacy could have contributed to instances of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, implying that without the discipline of celibacy, sexual recklessness could become more prevalent."
"The advocates for the abandonment of the vow of celibacy present several strong arguments. Firstly, they contend that celibacy is outdated, as there's no clear evidence of an obligation of priestly celibacy before the fourth century, as argued by experts such as George T. Dennis SJ and Peter Fink SJ. They also point to the numerous instances of secularization and removal of the requirement of celibacy, such as Pope Paul III commuting the vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity in 1540 and the Old Catholics' removal of the celibacy requirement in 1874. Secondly, they argue that celibacy is too pressuring or difficult, supported by anecdotes like Jimmy O'Brien's admission of the difficulty of celibacy and Elizabeth Abbott's assertion that celibacy has warped people throughout history. The third argument states celibacy is unnatural and unhealthy, with John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University, claiming that celibacy is an abnormal state. Critics also cite Biblical passages that seemingly oppose celibacy, such as the First Epistle to Timothy. The fourth argument revolves around the claim that celibacy leads to inappropriate sexual behavior. This is supported by evidence such as numerous allegations of sexual abuse against Catholic priests and statements from religious figures like Christoph Schönborn and Hans Küng, who associate priestly celibacy with sexual abuse scandals. Finally, they believe celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests, as suggested by the experience of Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck and Gerard's complaint about York canons avoiding ordination to evade the vow of celibacy."
"Opponents of the idea that we should abandon marriage present equally compelling arguments. First and foremost, they argue that marriage significantly benefits children, backed by a wealth of research from institutes like the CDC and the Institute for American Values. These studies show children from married families often outperform their peers from non-intact families in various areas, including education, health, and behavior. Secondly, they maintain that marriage is crucial for people, whether for religious, traditional, or general reasons. They cite its long history as an institution essential for social stability and argue that marriage mirrors our Creator’s unconditional love for us. The third argument declares that marriage makes people happier. Research conducted by John Helliwell published in the Journal of Happiness Studies, Robin Simon's research at Wake Forest University, and data from Pew all support the idea that married individuals generally report higher happiness and satisfaction levels than their unmarried counterparts. The fourth argument posits that marriage brings the couple closer. A survey suggests that married adults feel closer to their spouse than any other adult, and trust levels are also notably higher in marriages than in cohabiting relationships. Finally, they argue that marriage provides important financial benefits. Benefits range from Social Security spousal and survival benefits to income splitting, tax advantages, and cheaper insurance coverage. Inheritance tax benefits are also mentioned as a significant financial advantage for married couples."
"The proponents for abandoning marriage argue that the institution is oppressive towards women, unstable, laden with unfair obligations, and its purported advantages can be achieved by monogamous relationships. Evidence cited includes harmful norms that undermine women's rights, such as dowry-related abuse, female genital mutilation, and the expectation of female submission (CNN, personal accounts). The claim of marital instability is supported by evidence showing a global increase in divorce rates since the 1970s, with a peak of 48% of American marriages in the 1970s ending within 25 years (UN, Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers). Critics further argue that marriages often come with unfair obligations, citing examples of restrictive laws in Qatar, and medieval laws that enforced marital coercion and female subservience. Lastly, proponents assert that the emotional intimacy, reduced STD risks, and emotional stability expected in marriages can also be achieved in monogamous relationships."
"Opponents of this view argue that uniforms do not inhibit self-expression, reduce bullying, create a sense of equality and unity, encourage discipline and focus on learning, and can be cost-saving. In the case of self-expression, evidence indicates that students can express themselves in other ways and that fashion is not considered pure speech protected by the constitution (Andrea Dashiell, former student op-ed). The claim of reduced bullying is backed by evidence from the Department of Education and the Schoolwear Association, showing that uniforms can reduce bullying by minimizing differences in appearance. On the matter of equality and unity, research shows that uniforms promote a sense of belonging and reduce socioeconomic inequality (B.R. International Public School, David L. Brunsma). Uniforms are said to encourage discipline and focus on learning, as evidenced by Natasha Irshad's statement and a study revealing that 70% of principals believe uniforms reduce disciplinary problems. Finally, the cost-saving aspect of uniforms is supported by data indicating that school uniforms can be less expensive than regular apparel (NY Post, UK study)."
"Those who advocate for the abandonment of school uniforms present several compelling arguments. Firstly, they contend that school uniforms harm learning and creativity. This argument is grounded on the perspectives of academics, students, and fiction narratives. According to Dr. Tara Maginnis, uniforms promote conformity over creativity and impinge upon students' constitutional rights to free speech and expression. Senior Alyse Madsen further notes that strict dress codes limit students' self-expression and lead to a sterile, creativity-stifled environment. Secondly, the supporters argue that school uniforms can suppress students' self-expression. This argument relies on the First Amendment, scholarly studies, and expert opinions. A study from Arizona State University suggests that students from schools without uniform policies have a higher self-perception. Child psychologist Dr. Alan Hilfer notes that this might result in students resenting uniforms, defeating their intended purpose. Moreover, Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, argues that uniforms can instigate self-image issues, especially among body-diverse students. Thirdly, advocates highlight the financial strain uniforms place on families. Research reveals that school uniforms can pose an additional expense for families, pushing some into debt. The Children's Society estimates that the average cost of a school uniform is now around £340, a cost three times what parents consider acceptable. The fourth argument revolves around the uncomfortable and potentially sexist nature of school uniforms. Critics argue that uniforms can contribute to sexual crime in schools and hinder girls' physical activity. Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project, asserts that dress codes can implicitly encourage the acceptance of male entitlement to female bodies. The data from a GLSEN study corroborates this, showing a significant percentage of LGBT and transgender students were prevented from wearing clothes that reflected their identities. Lastly, the opposition to school uniforms suggests that uniforms stifle individuality and enforce conformity. Grace Chen of the Public School Review states that forced conformity might leave students ill-equipped for adult life where personal appearance plays a critical role. Other researchers point out that choosing their attire encourages independent thinking in students and prepares them for adulthood."
"Opponents of the abolition of capital punishment present a series of arguments for the death penalty's retention. They claim that it helps victims and their families find justice and closure. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster and Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge express their support for the death penalty, asserting that it provides justice for victims' families and loved ones. They also maintain that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, drawing upon the assertions of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Human Rights Watch, both of whom acknowledge the severity of certain offenses that might warrant capital punishment. Thirdly, they argue that the death penalty acts as a powerful deterrent to crimes. Charles Stimson of the Heritage Foundation cites general and specific deterrence and retribution as the primary penological objectives served by capital punishment. Armstrong Williams and David Muhlhausen also emphasize the deterrent effect, suggesting that the death penalty communicates a clear message to potential criminals and reduces murder rates. Lastly, they affirm the preventative function of the death penalty. Drawing on the research by Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd, the proponents underscore that capital punishment has a strong deterrent effect, with each execution potentially preventing an average of eighteen murders. This perspective reaffirms their belief that capital punishment is necessary to maintain societal order and safety."
"Supporters for the abolition of capital punishment believe it is inherently wrong, detrimental to the disenfranchised, and irreversible. They argue that state-sanctioned killing goes against the principles of human rights. Evidence from Amnesty International confirms this, stating that capital punishment is the ultimate denial of human rights. Further support comes from past court cases, such as Atkins v. Virginia, where the execution of people with mental retardation was ruled as cruel and unusual punishment, thereby indicating the intrinsic wrongness of the death penalty. Supporters also assert that the death penalty disproportionately affects the disenfranchised. They cite that the application of the death penalty is unfair and often skewed against people of color, and those who can't afford skilled attorneys. Furthermore, a study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts showed that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was almost eight times greater than a non-death penalty case, suggesting that the financial burden of capital punishment could be better utilized in areas that improve public safety, health, and welfare. Finally, the argument that the death penalty is irreversible is supported by numerous studies and statements. One key point is the inability of the death penalty to deter crime. In 2012, the National Research Council concluded that studies claiming capital punishment deters crime were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, the fact that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent is a strong argument against its use. As H. Lee Sarokin, a former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, stated, fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force."
"Opponents of the abolition of intellectual property rights believe that such rights incentivize creativity and innovation, promote investment in new products, prevent theft, and ensure rightful compensation for innovators. They argue that intellectual property rights are vital for economic growth and fostering innovation. This is substantiated by the World Intellectual Property Organization treaty and other international agreements, as well as the actions of the Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy in supporting the PRO-IP Act to protect American intellectual property and stimulate the job market. Opponents also state that intellectual property rights spur investment in developing new products. Supporting evidence includes the acknowledgment that intellectual property policy is a crucial tool for stimulating economic growth, as it provides commercial organizations with incentives to produce intangible assets. A joint research project by the WIPO and the United Nations University also demonstrated a positive correlation between the strengthening of intellectual property systems and subsequent economic growth. Furthermore, intellectual property rights are viewed as necessary protection against theft. Initiatives such as Operation In Our Sites led by the NIPRCC are cited as essential measures to detect and counter intellectual property violations on the Internet. Lastly, opponents argue that innovators deserve compensation for their endeavors, emphasizing that intellectual property rights secure a tangible return on their investment. This is demonstrated by the fact that IP-intensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added per employee than non-IP-intensive industries. Therefore, the exclusive rights granted by intellectual property laws provide a financial incentive and a means to cover associated research and development costs."
"Advocates for the abolition of intellectual property rights posit a variety of claims. The first is that these rights hinder the continual improvement of services and products. They cite examples like the case of Fox Talbot, whose patent rights on photography were accused of stunting the field's development in 1852. Economists such as Murray Rothbard argue that intellectual property laws discourage innovation as improvements might infringe on existing patents, discouraging further research. The second claim is that intellectual property rights limit access to critical information and products. They note how the duration and scope of copyrights have drastically increased from an average of 32.2 years to 95 between 1974 and 2004. They argue that it's in violation of the constitutional requirement for such rights to be for limited times. Thirdly, they suggest that these rights are fundamentally unfair. The People's Health Movement, for example, considers the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries and their citizens. Edwin Hettinger and Roderick T. Long argue that the philosophical tradition justifying property cannot guide us in thinking about intellectual property. Fourth, the advocates claim that intellectual property rights stifle creativity and innovation. An historical case cited is when a minister abolished virtually all patents, believing they held back industrialization. Petra Moser has also asserted that intellectual property laws might negatively impact innovation based on historical evidence. Fifth, they argue that these rights waste money. Bhagwati states that protecting intellectual property is merely a matter of royalty collection, and government-enforced monopolies, such as intellectual monopoly, create many social costs. Lastly, they argue that intellectual property rights are ineffective. They cite Tucker's argument that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot be held as property. Kinsella asserts that intellectual property rights can only be implemented by limiting others' physical property rights."
"Opponents to the abolition of the right to bear arms assert a variety of arguments. Firstly, they claim that gun control is ineffective. Evidence such as a 2016 Obama administration study shows that criminals largely obtain firearms through illegal channels. Studies also show that background checks had no significant effect on homicide rates, and states with concealed weapons restrictions had higher gun-related murders. Secondly, they claim gun ownership as a fundamental right. They cite legal precedents such as the District of Columbia v. Heller case, which struck down a handgun ban in Washington D.C. as violating the Second Amendment, which the court interpreted as establishing an individual right to possess firearms. Thirdly, they argue that gun ownership is essential for hunting and sport shooting. Pew Research reports that 32% of gun owners in 2013 owned guns for hunting, and 7% for sport shooting. Economic data shows substantial financial expenditure on hunting equipment. Fourthly, they believe gun ownership promotes self-protection. Journalist John Stossel argues that without the threat of retaliation from armed citizens, criminals will have an easier job. In addition, a 2013 survey revealed that 48% of convicted felons admitted avoiding committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed."
"The supporters of the motion 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms' base their argument on four primary claims: Claim 1 argues that banning guns would save lives. This is supported by data showing guns were the leading cause of death by homicide and suicide. Moreover, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that firearms were the second leading cause of child deaths, and another study associates the legal purchase of a handgun with an increased risk of violent death. Claim 2 maintains that gun ownership allows for mass shootings/general gun violence. Supporting evidence includes a study noting the increase in dangerous situations when more guns are present, and another suggesting that guns at home increase the risk of homicide by family members or intimate acquaintances. Claim 3 posits that guns can fall into the wrong hands, with evidence showing that many guns used in criminal acts initially enter circulation via legal transactions, and numerous instances where guns were stolen from homes or acquired from family or friends by those committing crimes. Claim 4 warns that guns lead to accidental deaths. According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths. Further evidence demonstrates the heightened risk of unintentional shootings for younger individuals, specifically those under 25."
"The opponents of the stance 'We should adopt an austerity regime' put forth five key claims: Claim 1 asserts that austerity cuts access to essential services, using evidence such as the significant decrease in public health grants in the UK, the rising number of emergency food parcels distributed by food bank networks, and the harsh effect on child and family welfare budgets. Claim 2 holds that austerity extends recessions, with evidence pointing to the negative impact of austerity measures on economic downturns, the exacerbation of economic hardships, and the ineffectiveness of these measures in stimulating sustainable economic growth. Claim 3 argues that austerity is unfair to citizens. This claim is supported by a report from the UN human rights council that declared poverty as a political choice in the UK, citing the country's breach of four UN human rights agreements, and the increase in child poverty and economic disaster. Claim 4 states that austerity results in lower growth. Evidence includes Greece's experience where austerity measures, despite reducing the deficit, failed to rejuvenate the economy. It also highlights the suppressed tax revenues and the halving of pay growth across OECD countries post-crisis. Claim 5 argues that austerity results in lower job creation. It uses evidence such as the belief that cutting government spending leads to large-scale unemployment and the high unemployment rates experienced in European countries under austerity regimes. The International Labour Organisation reports indicate an increased probability of unemployment or vulnerable employment, especially for women."
"Proponents of austerity argue that such an economic policy can lead to improved economic measures, long-term stability, deficit reduction, and overall economic resilience during troubled times. Firstly, the claim that austerity improves economic measures is supported by evidence from multiple countries. Canada during 1993-96 successfully reduced its fiscal deficit while maintaining strong economic growth. Similarly, Latvia and Estonia showed promising economic growth after pursuing fiscal austerity. The case of Greece also exemplifies the ability of austerity measures to achieve significant fiscal consolidation. Research by Harvard economist Alberto Alesina also indicates that spending cuts were often associated with economic expansions, not recessions. The argument that austerity is important in the long term is supported by the assertion that reducing budget deficits can bolster investor confidence about the long-term performance of an economy. The European Union has found that austerity measures worked to reduce budget deficits in countries like Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg, Sweden, and Hungary. Additionally, by carrying through with austerity, policymakers will eventually be rewarded with better financing conditions. On the point of stability, austerity is believed to increase economic stability, with Morocco's steady growth and low inflation rates being attributed to its austerity measures and promarket reforms. Similarly, in Ireland, a contraction in internal demand caused by austerity was offset by an expansion in external demand, contributing to macroeconomic stability. Austerity is also deemed essential for reducing deficits or paying debts, with the World Bank suggesting a debt-to-GDP ratio greater than 77% as a tipping point for economic slowdown. Austerity measures are used to avoid a sovereign debt crisis, which was observed during the Greek debt crisis and the subsequent eurozone crisis. The IMF loans commonly propose austerity measures, including wage bill cuts, VAT increases, and general public expenditure cuts. Lastly, proponents argue that an austerity regime is especially important in economically troubled times. Despite the immense challenges, Greece implemented stringent austerity measures during the financial crisis and achieved impressive results in fiscal sustainability."
"Opponents of adopting atheism argue on several fronts, including the violation of religious freedom, a lack of moral grounding, and the fundamental principle of personal choice. The claim that atheism discriminates against religious people or violates freedom of religion is supported by historical and contemporary examples. The philosopher John Locke argued that atheism could undermine social order and lead to chaos. More recently, the film 'The Golden Compass' was criticized for allegedly promoting atheism and undermining Christianity. Opponents also argue that atheism lacks a moral compass. Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, posits that while atheists can behave morally, they cannot rationally explain why they should lead a morally responsible life without belief.Finally, opponents believe in the freedom to choose whether to adopt atheism. Rod Liddle argues that choosing to believe or not to believe in God is a personal decision with no definitive scientific proof. Furthermore, the European Court of Human Rights has declared that individuals cannot be forced to adopt particular religious or atheistic views, signifying the necessity of personal choice in religious beliefs. This freedom to practice one's beliefs is subject to limitations prescribed by law in the interests of public safety, public order, health, and morals, and for the protection of others' rights and freedoms."
"The proponents of adopting atheism outline a multi-faceted argument. They suggest that atheism can be personally beneficial. Baggini asserts that atheism fosters a superior ethical basis, arguing that morality needs to exist independently of religious imperatives. La Mettrie advocates for atheism as the liberator of humans from oppressive ideologies, while other arguments emphasise the freedom and satisfaction atheists experience from being unbound by religious debates, dogma, and confusion. The proponents also argue that atheism should be adopted because the existence of God can't be definitively proven. Richard Dawkins, a renowned atheist, contends that no evidence could convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away. Similarly, atheist Michael Scriven states that atheism is the rational choice in the absence of any tangible evidence for God's existence. Further bolstering this claim, Theodore Drange and J.L. Schellenberg present arguments to the effect that if God truly wanted humans to believe in his existence, he would make it far more evident. The third line of argument focuses on the perceived immorality of religions. Critics claim that religion confuses obedience with morality, with one of the arguments being that if you are simply following a set of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Some assert that religion is intrinsically immoral because it is predicated on untruths. Furthermore, criticisms are levelled against specific religions, pointing to historical and contemporary wrongs as evidence of their immorality. Lastly, they argue that science can sufficiently explain the Universe. This is supported by claims that atheists or agnostics are more knowledgeable about religion than religious followers. Supporters of this claim often reference scientific achievements and advancements, like Darwin's theory of evolution, as an explanation for complex biological designs and as a counter to religious explanations of the Universe. Stephen Weinberg, a Nobel Prize winner, even suggests that weakening the hold of religion might be the greatest contribution scientists can make to civilization."
"Critics suggest that the libertarian focus on free markets can sometimes defend corporate capitalism and economic inequality, as noted by Carson. They point to instances such as the £27 billion failure of Northern Rock as an outcome of libertarian economic philosophy. The authors Teles and Lindsey suggest that poor regulation can suppress economic growth and increase inequality. Critics like Hale and proponents of government intervention argue that the libertarian focus on laissez-faire capitalism ignores market failures and can lead to economic instability and inequality. Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off: Some opponents point out that libertarianism could theoretically allow for morally dubious practices like non-coercive enslavement contracts. Philosopher James P. Sterba argues that libertarianism should prioritize the liberty of the poor, suggesting that the rich should be required to sacrifice some of their wealth to meet the basic needs of the poor. Sterba further argues that a morally consistent application of libertarian principles requires equality in the distribution of goods and resources. Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal: Critics suggest that libertarianism can lead to unjust outcomes, such as the historical example of American slaveholders being coerced into freeing their slaves. Critics also argue that libertarian claims of trickle-down economic prosperity are not supported by empirical evidence, pointing to increased income inequality in many OECD countries. They suggest that the libertarian emphasis on individualism can lead to unjust outcomes and ignore the importance of social cooperation. Libertarianism removes essentia laws/infrastructure/government services: Critics argue that libertarians' belief in the legalization of victimless crimes and their focus on protecting natural rights defined by private property can have negative impacts. They note that libertarians often reject regulation and collective control, which can prevent effective responses to issues such as environmental degradation. The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens: Critics highlight the crucial role of government in protecting human rights and the environment. They point out that government institutions enforce laws protecting freedoms such as speech, religion, and assembly, and that government action is essential for mitigating the impacts of climate change."
"The discourse we embark upon today scrutinizes the adoption of libertarianism, a political philosophy advocating minimal state intervention in the life of citizens. Its proponents argue that libertarianism fosters economic growth, bolsters freedom in the political system, promotes happiness and fulfillment, and reinforces individual freedoms. Firstly, the advocates of libertarianism posit that this ideology fuels economic growth. The argument is substantiated by examples drawn from economics and sustainability. Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins, in their book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, suggest that aspects of libertarianism can be merged with green politics to drive both economic and environmental progress. Additionally, libertarian proponents such as James Shikwati promote freedom of trade as a vital solution to poverty. The book 'Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution' by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins. The views of James Shikwati on trade freedom. Secondly, supporters assert that libertarianism amplifies freedom in the political system. The central idea is that decreased government intervention increases freedom for individuals. This is backed by studies such as that by the Cato Institute which found countries with lower government intervention levels have higher individual freedom and economic growth. Libertarian philosophers such as Robert Nozick and economists like James Buchanan affirm the fundamental importance of individual and property rights for a just and free society.Cato Institute's study on government intervention. Robert Nozick's and James Buchanan's theories on individual and property rights. Thirdly, it's argued that libertarianism enhances happiness and fulfillment. The ideology promotes laws that neither favor nor harm any race or sex, creating equal opportunities for all individuals. Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theory supports this claim, asserting that individuals derive the most happiness when engaged in fulfilling activities of their choice. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theory on individual happiness. The libertarian stance against laws favoring or harming any race or sex. Lastly, proponents argue that libertarianism bolsters individual freedom and liberties. They believe in self-ownership and oppose government bureaucracy, taxes, and infringement on personal rights. For instance, the philosophy of Rothbard, emphasizing self-ownership, supports this claim, dismissing all alternatives as inconsistent with a universal ethic. Rothbard's philosophy on self-ownership. Libertarian opposition to government bureaucracy and taxes, and promotion of private charity and diverse lifestyles. In summation, the advocates of libertarianism argue that the ideology, by advocating for minimal state intervention, enhances economic growth, freedom within the political system, personal happiness and fulfillment, and individual liberties. Its adoption, they propose, can usher in an era of prosperity, justice, and freedom."
"Our opponents argue for banning human cloning, but let's consider the life-saving potential it holds. The World Health Organization reports a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation. Imagine a world where cloning could resolve this, creating customized organs specific to an individual's needs, reducing the risk of rejection and enhancing the success rate of transplantation. As affirmed by the American Journal of Transplantation, personalized transplantation can have a transformative impact on transplantation's success. Now, let's ponder on infertility. According to the World Health Organization, about 10% of couples of reproductive age worldwide struggle with infertility. Cloning can gift these couples a genetically related child, a blessing as shown by studies from the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics and the Journal of Medical Ethics. Additionally, the New England Journal of Medicine affirms that cloning can help reduce the transmission of genetic diseases. Moreover, human cloning can be instrumental in promoting health. Courtney Campbell, the director of the Program for Ethics, Science, and the Environment at Oregon State University, affirms this. According to a study by the Lancet medical journal, cloning could provide a source of organs for those in need of transplants. The Nature Genetics journal has revealed that cloning could develop gene therapies for various diseases. Last but not least, cloning could be a catalyst for scientific research. New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 legislation and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two testify to the importance of cloning in advancing stem cell research. The Journal of Medical Ethics and the Journal of Medical Science also highlight cloning's potential in advancing our understanding of diseases and their treatments."
"The proponents of banning human cloning argue that we do not yet fully understand cloning's implications. Philosopher Leon Kass believes that the public's repugnance towards cloning human beings may be a deep wisdom beyond reason's power to fully articulate. He warns us not to transgress what is profoundly unspeakable. Furthermore, we must consider the ethical and religious implications of human cloning. Portugal's National Council of Ethics believes the cloning of human beings is ethically unacceptable due to the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person. Even Pope John Paul II has declared the techniques involved in cloning, which involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, as not morally acceptable. The argument against cloning continues with its unnatural essence. Rev. Demetri Demopulos, a Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist, opposes human cloning as it disrupts the natural order of procreation and fosters a culture of self-love. Finally, let's consider the safety concerns associated with cloning. Dr. Phil Noguchi of the FDA warns that human cloning risks transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newborn child. Studies published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics and Nature Biotechnology have reported low success rates, malformations, and premature deaths in cloned animals, highlighting the potential dangers involved in human cloning."
"The opponents of the banning of private military companies put forth four main claims.  Private military companies (PMCs) offer financial benefits. A report by the Congressional Research Service (2009) and a study in Defense and Security Analysis (2011) indicate that PMCs result in cost savings and provide efficient services compared to traditional military personnel. Furthermore, the RAND Corporation (2013) and the Heritage Foundation (2010) both argue that PMCs provide access to specialized skills and offer greater flexibility in personnel deployment, while a study in International Affairs (2010) suggests PMCs can streamline decision-making processes. PMCs are well-trained and better equipped. Evidence from the Heritage Foundation (2010) and the RAND Corporation (2013) suggests that PMCs require high levels of training and have access to advanced technology. Additionally, Defense and Security Analysis (2011) shows that PMCs often utilize state-of-the-art equipment, while International Affairs (2010) notes their expertise in unconventional warfare. PMCs can supplement regular armies in tasks the latter are unable or unwilling to do. Evidence from International Affairs (2010), the Heritage Foundation (2010), and the RAND Corporation (2013) argue that PMCs provide expertise in unconventional warfare, logistical support, and security functions that allow regular armies to focus on their primary missions. The Senate Armed Services Committee (2007) also highlights that PMCs can carry out sensitive, covert operations. PMCs increase safety. Defense and Security Analysis (2011) and the RAND Corporation (2013) suggest that PMCs provide improved security in conflict zones and deploy advanced technology to ensure operations safety. The Heritage Foundation (2010) asserts that PMCs can lead to more efficient resource use and can improve overall safety by providing support services."
"Supporters of the banning of PMCs present five main arguments. PMCs are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes. Human Rights Watch (2007) and the Congressional Research Service (2010) cite evidence of human rights violations and unlawful killings by PMCs, including the use of child soldiers as reported by the United Nations (2004). A study in the Journal of Business Ethics (2008) argues that PMCs can face ethical conflicts when serving their clients versus society at large. PMCs lack professionalism. Reports by Human Rights Watch (2006) and Amnesty International (2009) argue that PMCs often operate with limited accountability and transparency, leading to violations of international humanitarian law. Studies in International Affairs (2010) and Congressional Research Service (2009) note issues with unclear chains of command and hiring of poorly trained personnel. PMCs cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country. Evidence from the Congressional Research Service (2012), the Journal of Military Ethics (2009), and the Project on Government Oversight (2008) suggest that PMCs often prioritize contractual obligations over national loyalty, leading to potential conflicts of interest and mistrust. PMCs prioritize profit over ethical considerations. Human Rights Watch (2006), International Affairs (2010), and Amnesty International (2009) suggest that PMCs prioritize profit, often with limited accountability. The Project on Government Oversight (2008) and the International Peace Institute (2006) argue that the lack of industry regulation allows PMCs to put profit over other considerations. PMCs can encourage or prolong conflict. Reports from the Project on Government Oversight (2008), the International Peace Institute (2006), and Amnesty International (2009) argue"
"Ladies and gentlemen, imagine a child nurtured with a dream to act, a dream instilled by their parents and shaped by the world of celebrity culture. A 2014 study in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence affirms that parents significantly influence children's career aspirations. Furthermore, the Journal of Popular Culture in 2013 notes that celebrity culture impacts children's career choices, including acting. What if we take away the opportunity for these children to pursue their dreams? As the Drama Teachers Association of America noted in 2011, some children possess a natural talent for acting. The American Psychological Association also found in 2010 that acting allows children to express their emotions, further contributing to their interest in the performing arts. Consider the example of Ashwin Chitale, who found success and confidence at a young age and even won the best child artist award. On a broader perspective, child actors play a critical role in films and theatre. As reported by the National Association of Theatre Owners in 2013 and highlighted in the Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism in 2016, children bring diversity and help convey crucial themes in stories. The Actors Equity Association in 2014 pointed out that child actors increase audience engagement and widen the appeal of the production. However, we agree that there must be strict supervision and regulation. Child actors should be given adequate protection, including securing entertainment work permits, as required by law. Lastly, let's remember the sanctity of family decision-making authority. As emphasized by a Journal of Medical Ethics study in 2005 and reports by the Heritage Foundation (2008) and the United Nations (2015), parents should be the ones to make the best decisions for their children."
"Ladies and gentlemen, while we value dreams and aspirations, we must not forget the harmful impact acting has on a child's education. As revealed by a study in the Journal of Education and Practice in 2013, child actors often miss out on school and receive inadequate education. The American Academy of Pediatrics in 2009 found that this could lead to developmental and emotional difficulties, causing long-term negative effects. Moreover, child actors are often exploited, as seen in several scenes depicting child actors at odds with labor laws. The U.S. Department of Labor report in 2018 and a study in the Journal of Adolescence in 2012 alarmingly noted that child actors face wage theft, lack of breaks, and poor working conditions. What's more tragic is the loss of childhood among these young performers. As UNICEF's 2016 report and various studies indicate, child actors often spend most of their time working and rehearsing, leaving them with little to no time for normal childhood activities. The pressure on these children is enormous. Tight production schedules and high-stress environments can have severe emotional impacts on child performers, leading to mental health issues like depression and anxiety, as reported by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network in 2010. Most worrying are the problems that manifest later in life, as evidenced by the struggles faced by several former child actors. The career of a child actor often results in a troubling lack of identity when puberty strikes, leading to a deep-rooted crisis. It's high time we consider the implications and reassess the role of child actors in our society."
"Ladies and Gentlemen,  I rise today to stand against the motion to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. I assert that the closure would present two primary risks: a significant threat to our national security and a compromising shift in the treatment of detainees. On the point of national security, let me remind you that there are currently 80 hardened and unrepentant terrorists detained in Guantanamo Bay. The relocation of these detainees could directly risk America's national security. The director of National Intelligence reported that approximately 17.5% of former Guantanamo detainees have reengaged in terrorist activities after being transferred. We must consider these alarming numbers. Furthermore, the detainees include high-value enemy combatants with intimate knowledge of imminent threats to our country and those who, if released, would pose clear and ongoing threats. Our next point of contention is the humane treatment of prisoners. Contrary to popular belief, the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility providing humane treatment to all detainees and exceeding the standards of any maximum-security prison in the world. The International Committee of the Red Cross, human rights organizations, and Attorney General Holder can attest to this. Moreover, its isolated location ensures maximum security and presents various levels of confinement opportunities based on detainee compliance. Lastly, Guantanamo Bay is an unparalleled asset for gathering intelligence. It was strategically designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in our war on terror. It provides us an unprecedented opportunity to understand the inner workings of Al Qaeda and other such organizations. Top-ranking officials like Sebastian Gorka and Leon Panetta have emphasized the indispensability of Guantanamo Bay in collecting life-saving intelligence. We cannot overlook this critical function in our fight against global terrorism."
"Respected audience, we stand today to argue for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, advocating for the detainees' right to trial, the impact on the US's international image, and the unjust practices that have been prevalent. Firstly, we need to uphold the principles of our justice system. The U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Boumediene v. Bush, has already ruled that detainees have rights under the Constitution's habeas corpus provision to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts. We cannot let this landmark ruling be undermined. Our nation's reputation and commitment to the rule of law are at stake. Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantanamo’s negative impact on our nation’s reputation and national security. Its existence has been a blot on our reputation and served as a recruiting tool for terrorists. Leaders from organizations like Human Rights First have explicitly said that Guantanamo has long tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights. Moreover, Guantanamo Bay stands as a symbol of racial and religious injustice. Its existence shatters lives, shreds this country’s reputation in the world, and compromises national security. It has become a worldwide symbol of oppression, harming our international standing. Not only is Guantanamo a moral and strategic failure, but it's also a financial burden on the taxpayers. The annual cost of $540 million does not even include classified expenses. With only 40 prisoners currently housed, we are spending approximately $13 million per prisoner per year. Finally, we must address the human rights violations taking place within Guantanamo Bay. The treatment of prisoners has often crossed the line into abuse and even torture. Reports of sexual humiliation, physical abuse, and other inhumane practices cannot be ignored. Moreover, the tactics employed during detention and interrogation are starkly unjust, often entailing the use of coercive methods and denial of a fair trial."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, we stand today to strongly object to the proposition of ending affirmative action, arguing from three pivotal standpoints: affirmative action boosts diversity, it compensates for the past, and it reduces discrimination. Let's first discuss diversity. Several studies, including those noted by Scott Plous, Professor of Psychology at Wesleyan University, have shown the important gains in racial and gender equality as a direct result of affirmative action. Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, echoed this sentiment, underlining the effectiveness of affirmative action programs in increasing diversity and access for underrepresented groups. This is further supported by research indicating a substantial 23 percentage point decline in admission rates for students of color at selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban. Many major US companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, General Electric Co., and JetBlue Airways Corp. have expressed concern about losing access to a pipeline of highly qualified future workers and leaders without affirmative action. Our second argument revolves around the compensatory role of affirmative action. As articulated by Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, affirmative action serves as a meaningful remedy for prolonged and systemic discrimination. This viewpoint is upheld by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, defining affirmative action as a means to correct past or present discrimination and prevent its recurrence. The impact of these programs is evident in the significant gains for women and minorities in workforce participation and educational representation over the past decades. Our third stance emphasizes affirmative action's role in reducing discrimination. The National Organization for Women has highlighted how affirmative action levels the playing field, ensuring that women and people of color have a fair chance to compete in education and business. Support for affirmative action across the globe aligns with these goals of bridging inequalities, increasing access to education, and redressing apparent past wrongs."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, we argue in favor of ending affirmative action today, bringing forth five key points: affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Firstly, let's consider the diminishing of achievements. Connerly argues that affirmative action implies preferential treatment over merit and devalues the accomplishments of minorities. This sentiment is further amplified by studies that indicate a perceived devaluation of minority achievements due to affirmative action, as exemplified in Li's civil rights complaint against Princeton. Next, we contend that affirmative action is ineffective. Cases like Arizona's Proposition 107 illustrate the public's skepticism about affirmative action. The divide between privileged and less-skilled African Americans underscores the limited effectiveness of such policies in promoting social equity. The third argument is the unjust nature of affirmative action. We propose that it's a superficial solution to a deeper problem within the American education system. It prioritizes image over ensuring equal opportunities for marginalized communities, demonstrated by lawsuits against Harvard University for capping Asian American admissions. Fourthly, affirmative action is seen to perpetuate prejudice. Opponents label it as 'reverse discrimination', illustrated by Sweden's Supreme Court ruling that ethnic quotas are discriminatory. Moreover, affirmative action has been criticized for promoting biases against high-performing minorities, as noted in the ongoing Harvard lawsuit. Lastly, we argue that affirmative action reduces quality. Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, suggested that affirmative action programs that prioritize race over merit might obscure systemic problems and, hence, are a disservice to the very groups they aim to help. This is underpinned by the discrepancy in graduation rates and academic performance among different racial groups in higher education, indicating the inefficiency of affirmative action in equipping minority students with necessary tools for success."
"The opponents argue for maintaining mandatory retirement. They present two main arguments, first citing evidence that mandatory retirement creates opportunities for other, potentially younger, workers. Studies and reports by reputable organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the National Bureau of Economic Research, the International Labour Organization, the World Economic Forum, and the International Monetary Fund have shown that mandatory retirement can increase job mobility, encourage older workers to retire, boost employment for young people, promote intergenerational equity, and stimulate economic growth. Secondly, the opponents argue that mandatory retirement benefits those about to retire. They reference a report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, which found that mandatory retirement can increase financial security for workers. Workers can rely on receiving pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a set age, helping them prepare and plan for their retirement."
"Supporters of ending mandatory retirement present five key arguments. Firstly, they argue that mandatory retirement decreases institutional knowledge, using examples such as Air Traffic Controllers in the UK and Commercial airline pilots in the US, where there are no or increased retirement age limits. Successful business practices, like those of Greene, are also cited as evidence, as he implemented policies barring mandatory retirement age at his manufacturing facility. Secondly, the argument posits that mandatory retirement harms the economy. Several studies by the OECD, NBER, ILO, and the World Economic Forum, suggest that mandatory retirement decreases labor force participation, reduces productivity, leads to inefficient use of human capital, and impedes workforce diversity. Thirdly, mandatory retirement is seen as unfair or discriminatory, leading to age discrimination, disregard for individual circumstances, impaired life satisfaction, limited earning potential, and decreased sense of purpose as supported by studies and reports from AARP, ILO, WHO, NBER, and the Harvard Business Review. Fourthly, it's argued that mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire. This argument is backed by scholarly articles in The American Economic Review, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, Journal of Gerontology, and The Gerontologist. These studies suggest that mandatory retirement results in health declines, decreased economic well-being, reduced psychological well-being, decreased physical and cognitive function, and decreased social connections. Finally, they argue that everyone should be allowed to retire when they are ready. Studies by the World Health Organization, the Harvard Business Review, the International Labour Organization, AARP, and the World Economic Forum support the claim that retiring when one is ready promotes well-being, supports individual choice, maintains older workers' skills, supports active aging, and reduces the risk of poverty in old age."
"Opponents argue that nuclear weapons serve a critical function of protection and deterrence.  Nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. The essence of deterrence, a strategy that has been maintaining peace for approximately 70 years, is presented as crucial evidence. They also highlight the case of Ukraine's invasion, which doesn't signify the failure of nuclear deterrence but rather affirms it. Ukraine wasn't shielded by any nuclear umbrella, implying that countries not under deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are remain safe from a significant, direct military attack. Therefore, the opponents see nuclear weapons as a necessary evil that ensures a balance of power and mitigates the risk of major conflicts."
"Supporters of the abolition of nuclear weapons present several key arguments that highlight the dangers of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands. They cite evidence of the significant quantity of weapons-usable nuclear material that exists worldwide and could potentially be exploited for nuclear terrorism. They also emphasize the increase in terrorism since September 2011, suggesting an elevated risk of nuclear material being misused. The rise of terrorist groups such as Isis claiming the potential to obtain nuclear weapons further compounds this risk. Beyond intentional misuse, there are other risks, including the possibility of an irresponsible leader, theft by a terrorist organization, potential cyber threats to nuclear command, and unexpected mental health issues affecting those with access to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action. Supporters use recent conflicts, like the mobilization of Russian citizens for the war in Ukraine and the subsequent threats involving nuclear weapons, as examples. They point to the potential catastrophic impact of nuclear warfare, citing estimates from a potential Soviet nuclear attack that would have resulted in hundreds of millions of deaths. Furthermore, they point to simulations predicting over 91 million casualties within three hours of a nuclear warning shot. The Cuban Missile Crisis is used as an example to demonstrate how nuclear tensions can escalate rapidly due to unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings. They argue that similar flare-ups in tensions in the future may not end as luckily as the Cuban Missile Crisis. In conclusion, supporters strongly advocate for the abolition of nuclear weapons, citing the massive risks they pose to global security and human life. On the other hand, opponents argue that nuclear weapons play an essential role in maintaining peace and deterring major conflicts."
"Opponents of the motion believe that urbanization is not a force to be combated but rather a societal change to be embraced for its numerous benefits. Their first claim is that cities offer more opportunities. Migrants are usually driven to urban areas by the prospect of better lives. Evidence of this is seen in historical events like the migration of people from rural areas to metropolitan areas in Japan during its 20th-century economic development, driven by the promise of better jobs and education. It's also evident in Sihanoukville, where new investments are predicted to lead to growing economic opportunities and migration from rural areas. Their second claim is that urbanization is beneficial to the economy. Evidence from 12th-century Western Europe shows that urbanization can stimulate economic growth and generate revenue. Also, unplanned urbanization during Manchester's Industrial Revolution resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialized city. This line of thought is echoed in China's recent urbanization policies that have led to economic development through industrialization and international investment. Lastly, they claim that urbanization benefits the environment. Biodiversity, for example, can flourish in an urban landscape. The economies of scale that result from urban agglomeration can result in higher productivity and the same output produced using fewer resources, thereby reducing the ecological footprint. Furthermore, urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies which are crucial for a sustainable future."
"Supporters of the motion argue that urbanization brings with it a host of challenges that justify resistance. Their first claim is that imposing restrictions on migration would be beneficial for the people in rural areas. Economic decline coupled with increased population and urbanization has led to the decline of agrarian production . Venezuela's urbanization example shows that neglect of rural areas can lead to substantial economic disinvestment, depopulation, and abandonment. Secondly, they argue that urbanization leads to an increase in crime. This is evident in New Zealand's Māori population's struggle with issues like a rise in urban crime, poverty, and health problems following increased urban migration . Rapid urbanization and growing populations in places like Bopal & Ghuma have similarly seen an increase in criminal activities. Thirdly, supporters state that urbanization is harmful to the environment. As urban populations increase, rural populations decrease, leading to rural-urban inequality gap. Rapid economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization increase energy demand and emissions of air pollutants. Additionally, urbanization contributes to sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters, a harmful effect on the environment. Lastly, they claim that urbanization places a strain on cities' resources. Fast urbanization like in the case of Tagum leads to various problems like traffic congestion, sanitation, and land use . Overurbanization leads to detrimental effects like inadequate housing, high mortality, and a lack of educational facilities. In some cases, urbanization can even result in the creation of slums due to local governments' inability to manage it."
"Those who oppose compulsory voting have significant reasons. Firstly, they assert that abstaining from a vote is also a way to reflect one's preferences. Here, the act of non-participation is seen as a valid expression of one's political views. They support this claim with the philosophical insight from Herbert Spencer that, whether a person votes for the winner, a loser, or abstains, they are implicitly consenting to the rule of the elected candidate. Secondly, opponents believe citizens have an inherent right not to vote. They view compulsory voting as a breach of civil liberties and the freedom of speech, because, as they put it, the right to speak inherently includes the right not to speak. The invocation of totalitarianism as the ultimate endpoint of such compulsion adds weight to their argument. The third criticism is that compulsory voting may lead to uninformed or random voting. They draw on evidence from the Netherlands, where the abolition of compulsory voting led to an increased vote share for mainstream parties and decreased for minor ones. This, they argue, shows that forcing individuals to vote could lead to superficial campaigning techniques, potentially skewing the real intent behind democratic elections. Finally, the opponents of compulsory voting argue that not everyone has the ability to vote, citing a poll that shows most Americans don't know basic facts about their Constitution, suggesting that people might be casting votes based on disinformation."
"Proponents of compulsory voting believe that it has several significant advantages. They argue that compulsory voting increases representation. They back this claim with a study showing that compulsory voting reduced the gender gap in electoral engagement, and a Swiss study where it was found to boost support for leftist policy positions. They also believe that compulsory voting necessitates politicians to cater to all citizens, not just the well off or well educated. Furthermore, supporters believe that compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. They point to the case of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory where the introduction of compulsory voting led to improved democratic engagement. This increased interest, they argue, enhances the political education of citizens and lends more legitimacy to elected representatives. Lastly, the supporters believe that citizens have a moral obligation to vote. Drawing on the European Court of Human Rights' 1971 ruling, they argue that compulsory voting doesn't infringe upon fundamental freedoms. They highlight that citizens can still 'spoil' their vote if they wish to abstain, and remind us of the struggles fought to secure this right in many societies, further emphasizing the importance of not taking the right to vote for granted."
"On the opposition front, the first argument revolves around the harm cannabis inflicts on the body. Research from the Netherlands shows an increase in THC content, found in cannabis, leads to a rise in impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among inexperienced users. Furthermore, a 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore highlights the impact of heavy, chronic marijuana smoking on proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Also, the British Lung Foundation found that smoking three cannabis joints inflicts the same damage on the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes. The second argument addresses the increased lack of judgement or accidents associated with cannabis use. Notably, Anslinger, an infamous anti-drug crusader, proposed that cannabis causes people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally. A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use heightened the risk of an automobile crash. Similarly, a recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health revealed a significant increase in deadly car crashes involving cannabis and alcohol consumption in the United States over the past two decades. The third argument is built around the gateway theory, suggesting cannabis paves the way for the abuse of other illicit drugs. A 2006 study by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden demonstrated that adolescent rats given a small dose of THC were more likely to administer larger doses of heroin later on. The fourth argument pertains to the risk of legal cannabis reaching underage individuals. According to federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey, 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain despite the expenditure of billions towards arresting and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses. Lastly, the opposition claims that legal cannabis will boost the black market and criminal activity, citing the numerous illegal cannabis busts in California despite the legalization of medical and recreational use."
"Proponents of cannabis legalization offer counterarguments. Their first argument is that alcohol and tobacco, which are legal, cause more harm than cannabis. A 2002 DAWN report for the USA documents more than half a million deaths a year from legal substances, while only two possible drug-induced deaths were reported from marijuana. Secondly, they argue that cannabis is financially beneficial. It's suggested that legalizing cannabis could save billions by reducing prohibition enforcement and generate billions in annual tax revenues through proposed taxation and regulation. The third claim is that cannabis can be safe, healthy, and provide pain relief. For example, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences states that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans due to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart. The fourth argument states that legalizing cannabis would lead to its regulation. British Crime Survey statistics showed a decrease in cannabis usage among 16-24 year-olds after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C in 2004. Their fifth claim is that legalizing cannabis will decrease black-market activity and associated criminal activity, as the drug's financial appeal would be reduced. They cite support from Law Enforcement Against Prohibition and several British officials. Lastly, proponents argue that individuals should have the right to do whatever they want to their bodies, a notion rooted in philosopher John Stuart Mill's harm principle that underlines the sovereignty of the individual over their own body and mind."
"The topic of 'legalizing prostitution' has been met with stern opposition from some parties, who contend that this would entail a myriad of adverse consequences. First, they argue that such legalization would lead to an escalation in sexually transmitted diseases, a claim substantiated by several pieces of evidence. An Athens-based survey from the late 1980s found that of 350 registered prostitutes, 12 were HIV positive. By the late 1990s, this number had risen significantly among foreign prostitutes. Furthermore, studies in Africa, specifically in Ghana and Kenya, revealed prostitution as a major source of HIV and STD transmission. These studies demonstrate the health risks associated with prostitution, which are unlikely to be ameliorated by registration. Second, opponents highlight the moral complications of such a move, asserting that it would fuel immoral behaviour like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking. This is backed by several pieces of evidence, including a 2009 United Nations report, which stated that 79% of human trafficking is for prostitution. It is also argued that legalization can indirectly facilitate exploitation by pimps and criminal gangs, as evidenced by findings from the Netherlands, where such patterns were found after legalization. Third, critics argue that legalizing sex work will perpetuate violence against women. Citing critics of proposed legislation in Sweden, they note that legalization could increase risks for women in prostitution and further entrench societal patriarchy. Columnist Bob Herbert also highlighted the dehumanization of women in legalized brothels. Furthermore, studies such as Melissa Farley's suggest a correlation between legalized prostitution and high rates of sexual assault. Lastly, opponents argue that selling one's body is fundamentally immoral. This claim, however, lacks any explicit evidence in this material but could be supported by a perspective that views prostitution as a form of male dominance over women."
"Proponents of 'legalizing prostitution' assert that the move would have several benefits, both for the individuals involved and society at large. First, they contend that the legalization of sex work could provide an economic boost. Historical precedents like the city of Amsterdam and one of Seattle's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, support this claim by illustrating how well-regulated prostitution can contribute to the economy. Second, supporters argue that legalizing sex work would enhance sex workers' benefits, including healthcare, safe sex practices, and unionization rights. A wide range of evidence supports this claim, from a report that acknowledges the right of those exploited in prostitution to damages, to the Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour's call for the legalization and regulation of sex work to provide better working conditions and rights for sex workers. Third, proponents assert that legalization would enable better regulation of the profession. A 1995 study noted that consistent condom use in brothels led to the absence of STDs, showing how regulation could improve health outcomes. Similarly, attitudes in the Netherlands and Las Vegas support the notion that regulated, legal prostitution can be a valid occupation. Fourth, they claim that legalization will increase safety for sex workers. This is substantiated by evidence from the Netherlands, China, and New Zealand, demonstrating how regulation and decriminalization can mitigate violence and improve health and safety conditions for sex workers. Lastly, supporters argue that sex work should be recognized as a valid choice over one's body. They posit that as long as it is consensual, it should not be prohibited by the government. Additionally, it is suggested that prostitution can provide financial and social mobility benefits, and some studies have noted that sex work has become normalized among sex workers, reinforcing the argument for its acceptance as a profession."
"The opponents present three main arguments against it: gender imbalance, gender stereotypes, and the potential for increased abortions or infanticide. They argue that sex selection could exacerbate gender imbalances, citing China's one-child policy that bolstered son preference and resulted in the largest number of missing women globally. Some bioethicists, including Charles Lockwood of Yale, warn of the potential for social unrest and even wars from significant gender imbalances. The evidence further points to the declining ratio of girls to boys in India and China due to the preference for boys. Opponents also argue that sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases. They note that even with socioeconomic improvements and modernization, son preference still persists in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, especially in China. They argue that gender-biased sex selection is a manifestation of cultural preference for sons, leading to the discrimination of girls who are seen as depriving parents of the chance to have a son. Lastly, opponents of sex selection argue that it could potentially lead to increased rates of abortion and infanticide. They present evidence of how son-preference and the one-child policy in China have resulted in sex-selective abortions and the neglect, or even killing, of girls. In Britain, there was a case where two doctors accepted a request to perform an abortion based on sex selection, which is illegal, highlighting potential abuses of the practice."
"The proponents of the debate topic, 'We should legalize sex selection,' base their arguments on parental freedoms, family planning, family happiness, disease prevention, and reducing abortions or infanticide. Advocates argue that it is within the parents' freedoms to select the gender of their child. They believe that fulfilling the desire for a specific gender could instill some gender balance in the family. Moreover, it allows parents to plan for the family financially and to prevent gender-specific diseases. Proponents also argue that sex selection allows for better family planning. It provides control over the number of children they have, facilitating better care and educational opportunities. It is particularly beneficial in countries with population control measures, allowing parents to choose the gender of their single permitted child. They also claim that sex selection contributes to family happiness and completeness. It is argued that parents being able to choose their child's gender would result in more love towards the child. For parents who have lost a child, the ability to choose the gender of the next child can offer comfort. Proponents of sex selection argue it can be used to prevent diseases in the child. Technologies like Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) can prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases and other disorders. Lastly, supporters argue that sex selection could help prevent abortions and infanticide, especially where there is a cultural preference for a specific gender. If parents can choose the gender before birth, it could reduce the occurrence of gender-specific infanticide."
"The opposition stands firmly against the prohibition of flag burning, contending that it serves as an effective tool of expression, protest, and critique. We argue that flag burning is an important form of symbolic speech, as recognized by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The term 'flag burning' in common parlance refers specifically to an act of protest, rather than a senseless act of vandalism. This is exemplified in cases such as that of John Tinker and his sister, Mary Beth Tinker, whose quiet and passive protest of wearing black armbands was recognized as a form of protected symbolic speech by the court. Similarly, the case of Gregory Lee Johnson in 1984 provides another vivid example of flag burning as a form of expression. Mr. Johnson burned an American flag in protest of the policies of the Reagan administration, an act that was eventually ruled by the court as being sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment. Furthermore, we argue that flag burning is justified under the banner of freedom of expression. Judge White noted that if flag burning were found to be protected by the First Amendment, he would sustain such a conviction. Even the Supreme Court found in 1989 that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment. As Justice Brennan wrote, the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable."
"We, the proponents of this motion, argue that we should prohibit flag burning due to the inherent respect and symbolism flags carry, and to deter the inflammatory act of flag desecration. We affirm the notion expressed by Warren that laws against flag-burning are constitutional and therefore enforceable. The majority of countries across the globe recognize the importance of their national symbols and have laws forbidding the desecration of their flags, including burning them in public or using them for commercial purposes. For instance, by 1932, all American states had adopted flag desecration laws which prohibited the marking of the flag for any purposes and its use in any form of advertising. Even Hugo Black, a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, did not consider flag burning as a form of speech, implying a high level of reverence for the flag. We also argue that flag burning is an inherently inflammatory act. Justice Rehnquist has described flag burning as an 'inarticulate grunt or roar', most likely indulged not to express any idea but to antagonize others. Recent history records events such as the protest led by Khalid in 2003 where the act of burning the American flag led to antagonism. It's our belief that such offensive gestures should be regulated by law to ensure respect for our national symbol is maintained. In conclusion, due to the symbolic importance of the flag and the inflammatory nature of desecration, we maintain that the prohibition of flag burning is a necessary step in preserving national respect and order."
"The opponents of the stance 'We should prohibit women in combat' construct a multifaceted argument, leveraging historical, social, and practical evidence to support their position. Firstly, they argue on the grounds of gender equality, pointing out that equality is not just a human right but also an economic boon. Citing the European Union's legislation, they highlight the long-standing principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work. Further, they suggest that improving gender equality could lead to substantial GDP increases, as exemplified by the case of OECD countries where increasing female employment rates to match Sweden's could potentially result in a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. The second claim advocates that women are not only capable of combat but are actually a valuable asset. Historical evidence such as women serving alongside men since the Revolutionary War is presented. Furthermore, the superior cognitive, strategic decision-making, and social communication skills that women can possess, as observed by health professional Mar Nagel, are also highlighted. The argument is then extended to assert that women bring unique skills and strategies to combat scenarios. From their ability to address security risks uniquely, such as the example of Afghan women being more comfortable interacting with female service members, to their different perspectives and problem-solving approaches, women have a distinct and beneficial impact on the effectiveness of military units. The fourth claim posits that women can overcome physical differences and prove equally competent in combat. Evidence is presented to show women's superior ultra-endurance and the historical instances where women have led and excelled in combat roles, such as the Russian Women’s Battalion of Death in World War I and various roles in the U.S. military from the Revolutionary War to the present day. Additionally, the proponents contend that women should have the choice to serve in combat roles if they wish to. The sexism inherent in arguments against women in combat is called out and evidence like a 2010 British Ministry of Defense study, which concluded women performed the same as men, is introduced. Lastly, it is suggested that as long as women pass the required tests, they should be accepted for combat roles. This idea is supported by the fact that physical employment standards are objective, measurable, role-related, and gender-free, assessing individuals based on capability rather than gender. In essence, the argument is that the abilities of women who meet the standards should be acknowledged and utilized in service of their country."
"Supporters of the topic put forth the following arguments: Men are better suited to combat roles than women. This is supported by the biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density which affect their ability to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness (Veteran quote, Journal of Sports Science & Medicine, Marine Corps study). Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers. Evidenced by the British military's determination that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units. Further, the US Army has found that nearly half of female soldiers fail the Army Combat Fitness Test, raising concerns about whether increased fitness demands create barriers to success for women (Military.com). Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. Presidential candidate Rick Santorum argues that men's protective emotions toward women could become a distraction in combat. Furthermore, instances of fraternization may degrade unit cohesion and impact morale, potentially reducing operational effectiveness (Ministry of Defence). Women should serve in safer roles. During the Second World War, many women served successfully in non-combat roles including mechanics, pilots, and nurses. The 'warrior cultur' often prevalent in armed forces equates women with weakness and the need to be protected, suggesting their suitability for non-combat roles (Canadian Armed Forces study, DoD Task Force). The capture of women soldiers is a major concern. This is based on historical evidence of female soldiers being raped when captured in wars with Iraq. The argument suggests that women are less able to resist cold, interrogation, and stress due to their physiological and psychological makeup (ex-soldier quote). These arguments collectively assert that women should be prohibited from combat roles based on their physical and emotional characteristics, potential to distract or harm military function, suitability for safer roles, and the perceived risks associated with their capture."
"Our stance today is that journalism should not be subsidized. We firmly believe that government intervention risks inserting bias and harming objectivity. Looking at the history, we have examples like the alleged bias by Time Warner towards the Church of Scientology and the accusations of anti-India bias in the BBC's reportage. Government funding could potentially lead to favoritism in reporting, creating a perceived conflict of interest and damaging the fundamental principle of journalistic objectivity.  Furthering our point, we argue that the funds used for subsidizing journalism could be better spent elsewhere. Drawing from the past, when the only medium of communication was newspapers, postal subsidies were justifiable. However, in today's diverse media landscape, federal subsidies would likely protect inefficient companies, stifle competition, and discourage entrepreneurial initiatives. This is not the kind of environment we want to foster. Lastly, we stand on the belief that journalism, like any other business, should be self-sustainable. If it cannot survive on its own, it should be allowed to fail. In the wake of the federal government's bailout of banks and automobile manufacturers, it's clear that taxpayers can't afford to support failing media companies, nor should journalism be dependent on a government that is already burdened with debt."
"Those in favor of subsidizing journalism present several well-supported claims. Claim 1: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable. The viability of journalism, according to supporters, is essential for press freedom, as highlighted by the European Court of Human Rights in the Goodwin v. United Kingdom case in 1996. Additionally, with the proliferation of information online, including blogs and comments on news websites, the task of sifting through information has become complex, thus the need for a strong journalistic infrastructure. The 70% of Americans who believe that journalism is crucial to maintaining community quality of life and those concerned about the decline of investigative journalism funding underscore this point. In light of the substantial revenue losses experienced by news media during the pandemic, state subsidies have become a significant factor in ensuring the financial viability of media markets. Claim 2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability. The ongoing technological development in the digital age has led to an increased reliance on non-institutionalized and transnational information sources. Supporters of solutions journalism also see it as a valuable feedback system, providing credible responses to emerging societal challenges. The Associated Press has become an efficient source of accurate reporting, serving the growing demand for news. A study by the Trilateral Commission also suggested that the development of television journalism had a significant influence on the national power dynamics and undermined governmental authority. Claim 3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism. Advocates argue that subsidies can improve journalistic standards, as evidenced by the International Federation of Journalists' Ethical Journalism Initiative. Subsidies can also enhance journalists' economic literacy, as suggested by the IPD journalism program, and foster a media-plural Europe that encourages democratic decision-making and counters the prevalence of fake news. Claim 4: Subsidy increases objectivity in reporting. The last claim posits that subsidies can promote peace journalism, which presents local perspectives that oppose violence-exacerbating war journalism and expose violent groups' attempts to manipulate and exploit meaning. In conclusion, supporters of subsidies for journalism argue that such support is necessary for the viability, accountability, quality, and objectivity of journalism in our increasingly complex information environment."
"The opponents of the topic 'We should subsidize space exploration' have presented their arguments under four key claims. Claim 1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector. The opponents cite the significant achievements of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic as evidence for the potential of the private sector in space exploration. They point to SpaceX's successful delivery of cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) and their $3 billion contract for developing lunar lander spacecraft. They also reference NASA's agreement with Axiom Space to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed and the contracts awarded to Blue Origin, Nanoracks, and Northrop Grumman to develop commercial space stations. Claim 2: Space exploration is expensive. The opposing party argues that the financial implications of space exploration are substantial. They present evidence such as the cost of launching payloads into orbit, the ongoing costs of research and development, the cost of the personnel involved in the space industry, and the total annual budget of space agencies, which stands at $41.8 billion. Claim 3: Space exploration is ineffective Critics of space exploration funding argue that many endeavors in this area are scientifically useless. They highlight that satellite technology, while beneficial, does not contribute to life on Earth beyond providing commercial profits. Moreover, they argue that space travel is a significant source of pollution, with single launches producing hundreds of tons of carbon dioxide. Claim 4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration. Finally, the opposition asserts that there are more pressing and immediate issues that should receive funding, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. They argue that spending large sums of money on reaching other planets is questionable when those resources could be used to solve more immediate problems like global warming, crime, and diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. They offer a perspective on potential alternative uses for a $19.3 billion budget like funding university education for millions of young adults, providing healthcare for a similar number, or using that money to fund NASA for a year."
"The proponents for subsidizing space exploration put forward several key arguments: Claim 1: Space exploration can aid in colonizing the resources and lands of other planets. Evidence: Space colonies, powered by sunlight, can provide a new ecological niche and homes for humans, safeguarding us against natural and man-made catastrophes. Moreover, the expansion of our ecological niche into the solar system will open up possibilities for immense growth and survival. Walter Cugno of Thales Alenia Space underscores this view, arguing that space exploration offers opportunities to better understand ourselves, our planet, and improve life on Earth. Claim 2: Space exploration leads to advancements in science and technology. Evidence: Space exploration acts as a catalyst for technological innovation and scientific research. These advancements have provided us with tools and motivation to address significant challenges on Earth. For instance, satellite imagery and climate data support sectors like agriculture, helping to increase food production and identify new economic growth opportunities. Claim 3: Space exploration is financially beneficial. Evidence: Investment in space exploration not only creates jobs but also stimulates economic growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate more than $1 trillion in revenue by 2040, primarily driven by satellite broadband Internet access. Claim 4: Space exploration is vital for the future survival of humanity. Evidence: Technical innovations from space programs significantly improve our everyday life and contribute to a sustainable world. For instance, LED lights used in indoor agriculture and satellites used to forecast weather and climate patterns were funded or designed by space agencies. Furthermore, we'll need to replicate and sustain all of Earth's life-giving essentials off-world, which will require technologies that recycle resources, thereby helping preserve Earth's wellbeing. Claim 5: Space exploration provides invaluable information about the universe. Evidence: It enables us to answer fundamental scientific questions about the universe's formation, the origin of Earth, evolution of life, and the existence of life beyond Earth. Besides, spacecraft have proven critical in gathering valuable data about the various bodies in the solar system, contributing to our understanding of the cosmos."
"In the debate on whether 'We should subsidize vocational education', the opponents propose the following arguments: Firstly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes. To support this claim, they point to a 2018 study by the Urban Institute, which suggests vocational subsidies may not yield a good return on investment due to the limited career success or high-paying jobs produced by these programs. Furthermore, a 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research claims that such subsidies can detract funds from vital initiatives like early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education. Secondly, opponents claim that subsidizing vocational education is expensive. To back up this claim, they reference a report by the Center for American Progress (2018) and a study by the National Conference of State Legislatures (2021) that assert vocational education programs often require significant resources, which can compete with other educational priorities for funding. Thirdly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions. This claim is supported by evidence from studies analyzing the effects of subsidy programs in Germany and Switzerland. These studies found that subsidies significantly increased enrollment in vocational programs, potentially causing an imbalance by concentrating too many students in vocational fields. Lastly, opponents believe vocational education is not a good career choice. The National Skills Coalition's study (2018) supports this by stating that many vocational programs prepare students for low-wage jobs with limited benefits. Additionally, a report by the National Center for Education and the Economy (2014) found limited transferability of skills from vocational programs, impeding workers' ability to switch careers or industries."
"Claim: Subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources. Argument: Subsidies for vocational education increases its accessibility, particularly for low-income students and those who face barriers to traditional postsecondary education. This is based on the National Skills Coalition's 2020 report that showed such subsidies can increase job opportunities and economic mobility for these individuals (Evidence 1 and Evidence 5). Moreover, a report by the Center for American Progress in 2018 found that subsidies could better align vocational education with local labor market needs, thus improving workforce development. Claim: Vocational education better fits many students. Argument: Vocational education provides a more practical, hands-on learning experience that suits many students better than traditional classroom-based education. This assertion is backed by a 2020 report from the National Skills Coalition and a 2019 study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, which found vocational education to meet current workforce needs, cater to students' career goals, and lead to lower dropout rates (Evidence 1 and Evidence 2). Claim: Vocational education is a good career choice. Argument: Vocational education prepares individuals for high-demand fields such as healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022 highlighted the high demand for skilled workers in these sectors (Evidence 1). A study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in 2020 further indicated that those with vocational education have higher earning potential and shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional degrees (Evidence 2 and Evidence 3). Claim: Vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society. Argument: Subsidizing vocational education can boost economic growth, increase workforce productivity, and enhance social mobility. The National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium's 2019 study demonstrated that vocational education could address workforce shortages in specific fields (Evidence 1). Meanwhile, a 2020 study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that investing in vocational education could increase workforce productivity and contribute to overall economic development (Evidence 3). Finally, the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that investing in vocational education could enhance social mobility, making it beneficial for the entire market and society (Evidence 4)."
