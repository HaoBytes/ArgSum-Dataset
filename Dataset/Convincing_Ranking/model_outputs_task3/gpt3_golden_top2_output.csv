This debate is on the topic of whether or not assisted suicide should be a criminal offence. Opponents of this stance argue that assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it, reduces suffering, grants people the freedom to choose to end their life, and can benefit the terminally ill. Evidence supporting these claims include the prominent organisations like ""Dignitas"" and the “Washington Death with Dignity Act” which recognize the concept of dignity in this situation. It is also stated that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts with due care and that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally. It is also noted that in some countries, such as the Netherlands, a law has been passed legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide and examples of terminally ill persons that have benefited from this are given."
"
The debate topic is ""Assisted Suicide Should be a Criminal Offence"". The stance for the debate is in favour of this motion. Proponents of this position argue that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role, people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others, and that those who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. Evidence supporting this includes the fact that The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text. Additionally, The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient. Furthermore, the majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Lastly, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia. 

In conclusion, the debate is focused on whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offence and the stance taken in the debate is in favour of this motion. The arguments presented are that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role, people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others, and that those who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. Evidence presented includes the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death, the prohibition of physician-assisted suicide by the State of New York, and the slippery slope argument."

In this debate, the opposition argues that homeschooling should not be banned. Their main points are that homeschooling can be the best option for exceptional, religious, ill, and disabled students; that it can be personalized to the child's pace/needs; that mainstream schools can have a lot of violence/bullying; that parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children; and that the home is a good learning environment. They provide evidence such as Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services provided to home-schooled students in Eastern York schools, the autonomy that homeschooling provides, the opportunity to personalize education to a child’s interests, needs, ability and learning style, and the deeper understanding of their children's education progress that parents can have. They also cite studies that report home-educated students are more mature than schooled peers. All of these points point to why banning homeschooling would be a detriment."
"
The debate topic is 'Homeschooling should be banned'. The supporters of this stance argue that homeschools cannot be regulated or standardized, and that mainstream schools are essential for developing social skills, of higher educational quality, and parents are not qualified to be teachers. Evidence in support of this stance includes stories such as Vyckie Garrison's, who was not able to provide her six school-age children with a quality education due to lack of regulation and depleted energy. Mainstream schools also offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward, experiences homeschooled children miss out on. Opponents of homeschooling, such as the National Education Association, argue that it should be banned in order to protect the social safety net for the most vulnerable population: children. Additionally, the European Court of Human Rights has upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating that the right to education calls for regulation by the State. Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet argues for bans on homeschooling, claiming it is important for children to grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, and ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance. Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich has also warned that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view. Finally, homeschooling requires a lot of extra work and resources such as references, and checking for DBS certificates, which can be difficult for parents to provide. 

In conclusion, the supporters of banning homeschooling argue that it cannot be regulated or standardized, it deprives children of important social experiences, it is of lower educational quality than mainstream schools, and parents may not have the resources to adequately provide for their child's education. This debate is about protecting the most vulnerable section of the population: children."
"
The topic of the debate is 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'. The stance taken by its opponents is that mandatory routine child vaccinations are dangerous and contradict basic rights. Evidence 1 for the first claim is that Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, was withdrawn from the market nine months after its introduction due to its possible contribution to higher instances of intussusception. Evidence 2 for the same claim is that the CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, and a “small possibility” exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Evidence 1 for the second claim is that the First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' and Evidence 2 for the same claim is that compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is part of the right to private life as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Opponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations argue that the side effects of such vaccinations are dangerous and that they contradict basic rights. They cite the example of Rotashield which was withdrawn from the market nine months after its introduction due to its contribution to higher instances of intussusception. Furthermore, the CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine and a small possibility exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Furthermore, they argue that mandatory vaccinations are a violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which states 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof', and that it is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights."
"
In summary, it can be argued that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory in order to protect both the children themselves and the greater public. Evidence has shown that child vaccinations are effective, saving lives and preventing the spread of diseases such as polio, measles, and pertussis. For example, since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease has been noted in those of less than two years of age. Additionally, according to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide, down from 350,000 cases in 1988 due to vaccination programs. Furthermore, cases such as a 2005 measles outbreak, attributed to one unvaccinated teenager, demonstrate the importance of making sure that communities have high enough herd immunity levels to prevent these viruses from spreading. Vaccines are also key in preventing childhood mortality from diseases such as smallpox and pertussis, which have already killed millions of people and have the potential to do so again. Therefore, it is essential that routine child vaccinations be made mandatory in order to protect the children and the general public."
"
This debate addresses the topic of whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. The opponents of this idea argue that social media regulation is not effective, as evidenced by the failure of legislation like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act to take effective action against companies such as Facebook and Google for their data-collection practices. They also argue that social media regulation harms privacy, with most U.S. adults feeling they have little or no control over how their personal information is used. Additionally, opponents contend that social media regulation harms freedom of speech and other democratic rights, as witnessed in Vietnam, and that government intervention in private companies can lead to excess bureaucracy and inefficiencies. Lastly, they argue that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government, citing examples such as dark advertisements targeting minority communities."
"
The debate topic is ""Social media platforms should be regulated by the government"" which has a positive stance. The supporting claims are that social media regulation can protect younger audiences, combat fake news, be beneficial to society at large, help to deal with negative content, and is necessary to deal with malicious users. To support these claims, evidence was presented such as the statement from the British government that it must act to protect young people online, the death of a young British teenager due to distressing content, the low percentage of Republicans who believe the media report the news accurately, the European Union's legislation to combat misinformation, the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act in the European Union to make social media platforms more transparent, and the 60 million cases of unauthorized access to social media accounts in 2011. Thus, the debate concludes that social media platforms should be regulated by the government to protect younger audiences, combat fake news, benefit society at large, help to deal with negative content, and deal with malicious users."
"

In conclusion, the USA is not a good country to live in. This is evidenced by the unfair health and education policies, problematic and divisive political system, negative culture, high taxation and costs of living, inequality and poverty, insecurity and xenophobia. For instance, the study found that white teachers were more likely to give constructive feedback on essays if they believed the student who wrote it was white. Moreover, the ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people, veterans, and disabled. In addition, over 6,600 incidents of hate crime (including physical attacks on Asian elders) have been reported nationwide since the start of the pandemic. Finally, there is evidence that white supremacy exists in U.S. school curriculum to the detriment of non-White students and American society as a whole."
"
The debate topic is 'The USA is a good country to live in'. The positive stance of this debate is that the US is a good country to live in due to its strong economy, high quality health and education systems, great environment and nature, freedoms and democratic rights, powerful status, and opportunities for individuals. Evidence to support this argument includes statistics showing the US has one of the highest per capita incomes in the developed world, 40 of the top 100 universities in the world are located in the US, the US is home to incredible natural wonders, the American Declaration of Independence was the first civic document to meet a modern definition of human rights, US culture has been shaped by many cultures from around the world, the US has been ranked the most powerful country for the seventh time, and job growth in the US is surging with the addition of 943,000 jobs in July. All this evidence suggests that the US is a great country to live in."
"
In the debate over whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned, opponents of the motion argue that celibacy allows priests to focus on God, as evidenced by the teachings of Paul VI and Origen that the increased solitude from family obligations can nurture a priest's spiritual life, as well as Paul's belief that any call to a life devoted to God will be aided by God's grace. Furthermore, they point out that celibacy has been part of religious traditions since the Church's beginnings, and that celibate priests are perceived to be more holy than those who are married. Additionally, they assert that priests have the choice to be celibate, citing the examples of Paul and the four German women who took the vow of celibacy, as well as the risk of sexually reckless behavior if the vow is removed, as suggested by the Archbishop of Vienna and the Catholic Church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia."
"
The debate topic 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned' suggests that the traditional practice of priestly celibacy is outdated, too pressuring/difficult, unhealthy/unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Supporters of the topic provide evidence to support these claims, such as Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540), according to George T. Dennis SJ and Peter Fink SJ of Catholic University of America; the sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle according to Jimmy O'Brien; some of the nuns who returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy endured considerable hardship; celibacy is an unnatural act in nature; the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy caused depression in priestly figure Nouwen; in 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States; and Urbain Grandier is known to have had sexual relationships with a number of women and to have acquired a reputation as a philanderer. Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage and Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that celibacy is an outdated, pressuring/difficult, unnatural, and leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Thus, it is reasonable to argue that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned."
"
In summary, this debate is discussing the proposition of 'We should abandon marriage'. Its opponents argue that marriage is beneficial for children, for people either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons, makes people happy, makes the couple closer, and provides important financial benefits. To support these claims, evidence has been provided such as showing that children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father, that when a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption it is one of life's greatest blessings, married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting, and that married couples are eligible for financial benefits such as lower tax brackets and Social Security benefits."
"
In summary, the debate over the topic 'We should abandon marriage' is based on the claims that marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women; marriages are unstable; marriages tie up people with unfair obligations; and most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship. Evidence supporting these claims show that women are expected to be submissive to male family members and experience female genital mutilation (FGM); divorce rates have increased globally; women are required to have male guardian permission to marry and deemed “disobedient” if they do not obtain their husband’s permission; and a monogamous relationship provides greater stability and emotional security."
"
This debate addresses the issue of whether we should abandon the use of school uniforms. The opponents argue that school uniforms prevent children from expressing themselves, reduce bullying, create a sense of unity and discipline, and save money for families. Evidence includes a former student at Hershey High School, who wrote an opinion piece claiming uniforms do not silence voices, a survey of eighth graders that found they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways while wearing uniforms, research from the Department of Education showing that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, a Texas survey that found students in uniforms reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than those not in uniforms, a statement from a teacher that uniforms help to focus on academics and minimize disciplinary problems, and finally, a UK study that found the average school uniform costs parents significantly less than the average non-school outfit."
"
In summary, the debate over whether schools should abandon the use of school uniform has been a long and contentious one. Supporters of the argument that we should abandon the use of school uniform claim that it can harm learning and creativity, as messages of conformity over creativity are sent to students, and that it also harms self-expression, as one study at Arizona State University found that students from schools without uniform policies had higher self-perceptions. Additionally, supporters point to the financial burden school uniforms can have on families, as well as the discomfort and sexism that can be associated with certain uniform designs. Finally, opponents also argue that school uniforms can increase conformity and limit individualism, which can have detrimental effects on developing individuals."
"
The debate is about the issue of abolishing capital punishment. The opponents of this argument suggest that capital punishment helps victims and their families achieve justice and closure; it is acceptable for cases of severe crimes; and it can prevent crimes from taking place. They cite evidence from Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina, Leslie Rutledge, Arkansas Attorney General, Tom Cotton, US Senator (R-AR), the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, David Muhlhausen, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, and Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd, professors of economics and law respectively, to support their claim. These pieces of evidence indicate that the death penalty provides justice and closure to victims and their families, and it can act as a deterrent to crimes and prevent them from taking place. As such, opponents of the argument are in favor of retaining capital punishment."
"
The debate topic is whether or not we should abolish capital punishment. Proponents of this stance argue that state-sanctioned killing is fundamentally wrong, as the death penalty system in the US is unfair and unjust and disproportionately impacts people of color and those with less resources. In addition, capital punishment is costly and diverts resources away from other cases. Furthermore, executions are irreversible and do not prevent crime. Studies show that the American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation's executions, while states without the death penalty have much lower rates. These facts support that capital punishment does not deter potential criminals. In light of these facts, it is clear that capital punishment should be abolished."
"
Summary: The debate revolves around whether intellectual property rights should be abolished or not. Its opponents argue that intellectual property rights are necessary in order to incentivize creativity and innovation, protect investments in developing new products, and provide a fair reward for the efforts put in by creators and innovators. To support this argument, opponents have provided evidence such as the work of UPOV in codifying intellectual property, the US Senate Judiciary's aim to protect American intellectual property, the incentives provided by public opinion, Operation In Our Sites, and licensing terms of intellectual property."
"
This debate focuses on the topic of abolishing intellectual property rights, with the positive stance that intellectual property rights restrict access to important information and products, are unfair, harm creativity and innovation, waste money and are ineffective. Evidence used to support this argument include that by 1852 many in the photographic community felt Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property were hampering the development of photography in England, Professor Lessig's analysis of the tension between piracy and property in the intellectual property realm, the General Assembly's recognition of the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples, the PHM's view of the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights as iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries, Edwin Hettinger's argument that natural rights arguments for intellectual property are weak, and Murray Rothbard's argument that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation. In addition, evidence of intellectual property's ineffectiveness includes the argument that copyright is invalid and Tucker's belief that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot be rightfully held as property."
"
The debate is about whether we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. Opponents of the claim argue that gun control is ineffective, gun ownership is a right, gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports-shooting, and gun ownership promotes self-protection. Evidence supporting these claims includes findings from a 2016 Obama administration study that showed only 10.1% of firearms used in crimes were obtained through a retail source, a study in Applied Economics Letters that found “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level”, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller that established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms, data from 2016 showing that 10 million people used firearms for hunting, a Gallup survey from 2019 showing that 63% of gun owners cite personal safety or protection as the reason for owning a firearm, and journalist John Stossel's statement that if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns."
"
Summary: This debate discusses the topic of abolishing the right to keep and bear arms. Supporters of the motion argue that banning guns would save lives, as a study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that the legal purchase of a handgun is associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death. Additionally, Harvard professor David Hemenway wrote that there is a correlation between gun availability and homicides. Supporters also suggest that gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence, referencing a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine which found that guns kept in the home are associated with an increased risk of homicide. The third argument is that guns can fall into the wrong hands, citing the Texas church shooting as an example. Finally, supporters cite accidental deaths, especially those under 25, as a key reason to abolish gun ownership. A study from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence found that states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths."
"
The topic of the debate is ""We should adopt an austerity regime"". This stance has been argued against by citing evidence that austerity cuts access to essential services, extends recessions, is unfair to citizens, results in lower growth and job creation. 

Evidence has shown that austerity cuts have led to a third of local authority budgets being cut from 2010 to 2018 and a £700m fall in public health grant between 2014 and 2019, according to the UK National Audit Office and the Health Foundation Report respectively. Additionally, analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has fallen by 44% in the same time frame.

Furthermore, austerity has been pointed out by many economists to have contractionary effects and exacerbate recessions, with examples in Argentina, Russia and Turkey. Furthermore, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights declared that poverty levels in the UK, the world's 5th largest economy, were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”.

The effects of austerity have also been detrimental to growth, with a disastrous effect on Greece's economy in particular, even though the country's deficit has decreased. Additionally, the lack of job creation due to austerity has been seen in countries like Greece and Spain, with unemployment rates of 25.6% and 22.9% respectively. 

In conclusion, evidence has been presented to argue against the stance that we should adopt an austerity regime, showing that it cuts access to essential services, extends recessions, is unfair to citizens, results in lower growth and job creation."
"
The debate topic is whether we should adopt an austerity regime. Those who are in support of this have argued that it can improve economic measures, be important for the long term, increase stability, reduce deficits or pay debts, and is essential in economically troubled times. For example, Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in the past 12 months at Q1 2012 due to austerity measures. In 2012, the EU Commission also produced a report claiming that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. Similarly, Morocco was heavily indebted in the 1980s but implemented austerity measures which improved economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment. In addition, a World Bank study found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77%, it slows economic growth. Lastly, US President Warren G. Harding cut the federal budget by almost 50% and reduced taxes for all income groups in response to the recession in 1920-1921. These all provide evidence to support the claim that an austerity regime is an effective tool for dealing with economic issues."
"
This debate revolves around whether we should adopt atheism as a belief system. Opponents of atheism claim that it discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion, citing John Locke's argument that the denial of God's existence would lead to chaos and Bill Donohue's two-month boycott of The Golden Compass film as evidence. On the other hand, they argue that people should choose for themselves whether atheism should be adopted, with Richard Liddle's statement that there is no scientific proof either way being a supporting evidence. Additionally, the European Court of Human Rights has also found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion, which means that public authorities should provide alternative forms of affirmation that aren’t connected with religion."
"
In summary, the debate is about whether we should adopt atheism or not. The positive stance claims that atheism is beneficial, and that it should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists, religions are immoral, and science can adequately explain the universe. Supporting evidence includes Baggini's argument that atheists have an advantage in evaluating morality, La Mettrie's view that atheism is a means of liberating humans from oppression, Michael Scriven's statement that we need not have a proof of God's existence, and Chapman's argument that scientific naturalism perspective looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. Additionally, evidence suggests that followers of atheism and agnostics have more knowledge about religion than those of major faiths."
"
In summary, the debate topic is ""We should adopt libertarianism"", and its opponents have argued that libertarianism harms economic growth, minorities and those who are worse off, is unjust/non-equal, removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services, and the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens. Evidence for these claims includes George Monbiot's article in The Guardian connecting libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock, Steven Teles and Brink Lindsey's The Captured Economy, Robert Nozick's position on slavery contracts, James P. Sterba's application of ought implies can to establish the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Joseph Stiglitz's market failures argument, Human Rights Watch's report on the importance of government protection of human rights, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report on government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In short, opponents of libertarianism argue that it does not provide sufficient economic growth, leads to inequality, and removes essential laws and infrastructure that protect citizens and the environment."
"
In this debate, it is argued that we should adopt libertarianism. The proponents of the stance argue that libertarianism has a range of benefits, including increased economic growth, increased freedom in the political system, increased happiness and fulfilment, and increased individual freedoms and liberties. To support their arguments, they point to evidence such as the book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution (2000), which argues that elements of libertarianism and green politics can coalesce to produce economic and environmental benefits. Furthermore, they cite a study by the Cato Institute, which finds that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth. Libertarianism is also seen as increasing individual happiness, as it allows individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. Lastly, libertarianism increases individual freedoms and liberties, as libertarian thinkers like Sunstein and Thaler argue that people should be free to do what they like, and Rothbard defends the self-ownership principle, which he argues is both axiomatic and universal."
"
In the debate regarding the topic 'We should ban human cloning', the opponents argue that cloning has potential benefits for organ replication, assisting those who can't otherwise have a child, promoting health, and furthering research and science. As evidence for the first argument, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation and, according to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation. For the second argument, the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility and a study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility. For the third argument, a study by the Nature journal found that cloning could greatly advance stem cell research and Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at Oregon State University, states that given the potential for health benefits, some conservative Protestants could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning. For the fourth argument, New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 specifically permitted human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research. An issue of the popular science magazine New Scientist further notes that the International Raëlian Movement was starting a company to fund the research and development of human cloning."
"
In summary, the debate of 'We should ban human cloning' has supporters on both sides. The positive supporters are in favor of banning human cloning due to a lack of understanding of the process, unethical/anti-religious implications, it being unnatural, and it being unsafe. Supporters argue that cloning is not understood enough yet, and that allowing it means treating children as pure projects of our will, in contrast to the natural process of procreation. They also point to the ethical and religious implications, such as Pope John Paul II’s opinion that techniques involving manipulation and destruction of human embryos are not morally acceptable. They further argue that cloning disrupts the familial order and is unnatural. Additionally, supporters point to the safety risks of cloning, including the risk of transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child, as well as the low success rate of cloning animals with many suffering from health problems and genetic abnormalities."
"
The debate topic is 'We should ban private military companies'. Those against the ban claim that the hiring of private military companies is financially beneficial, they are better trained and equipped, can supplement regular armies in specific tasks, and increase safety.  Evidence supporting these claims include a study published in the journal Defense and Security Analysis in 2011, which found that private military companies can provide more efficient services compared to traditional military personnel, as well as cost savings for the government; a report by the Congressional Research Service in 2009, which found that private military companies often provide specialized training programs to their personnel and invest in advanced technology; a study published in the journal Defense and Security Analysis in 2011, which found that private military companies can provide access to specialized skills and expertise that may not be available in the regular army; and a report by the Heritage Foundation in 2010, which found that private military companies can provide more efficient use of resources and support services, such as logistics and communications, improving overall safety."
"
In conclusion, it is clear that private military companies should be banned due to their unethical and unlawful practices, lack of professionalism, potential conflicts of interest, focus on profit, and ability to solicit and prolong conflict. Evidence of their unethical and unlawful practices can be found in the United Nations 2004 report on child soldiers, the Congressional Research Service 2010 report on unlawful killings, Amnesty International's 2009 report on poorly trained personnel, Human Rights Watch's 2006 report on limited accountability, the Journal of Military Ethics 2009 study on conflicts of interest, and the International Affairs 2010 study on limited accountability. Furthermore, private military companies' tendency to prioritize profit over ethical and legal considerations, as highlighted by the Project on Government Oversight's 2008 report, and their potential to prolong and escalate conflict, as found in the Congressional Research Service 2009 report, further demonstrate why they should be banned."
"
In summary, the debate topic is whether or not we should ban the use of child actors. Opponents to the ban argue that acting may be the child's dream, and that child performers are necessary for roles, that they should not be banned as long as there is proper supervision and regulation, and that the parents should decide for their child. Supporting evidence includes reports from the Drama Teachers Association of America, American Psychological Association, National Association of Theatre Owners, Journal of Family Psychology, and anecdotal evidence from a child actor's experience. In general, opponents to the ban believe that child actors should be allowed as long as there is proper supervision and regulation, and the parents have the final say in whether or not their child can act."
"
The debate topic is 'We should ban the use of child actors'. It is argued that banning the use of child actors is necessary due to the adverse effects that come with such a profession. Evidence suggests that it can lead to a lack of education, exploitation, loss of childhood, stress, and long-term difficulties. Studies have shown that child actors often miss school or receive inadequate education, leading to a lack of basic skills and knowledge. They are at risk of labor violations, such as wage theft, and may even be at risk of human trafficking. Child actors are often exploited and exposed to unhealthy working conditions, leading to the loss of their childhood. They also often suffer from mental health issues such as depression and anxiety due to the pressure and stress associated with their work. Moreover, due to the stressful environment to which child actors are subjected, they may develop problems later in life."
"
The debate on the topic 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp' presents opposing arguments. Supporters of the closure of the Guantanamo bay detention camp argue that it is necessary for upholding moral standards and protecting human rights, while opponents of the closure argue that it would harm national security, is better for prisoners than other options, and is essential for gaining intelligence. Evidence in support of the opponents' stance includes statistics of former detainees reengaging in terrorist activities, the high security level of the facility, and its importance as an intelligence center."
"
The debate is over the topic 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp'. This stance argues that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed due to the fact that the detainees have the right to trial in US courts as ruled in Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)], it harms the US image/reputation/institutions, it is a symbol of discrimination/injustice, it is expensive, personnel commit crimes against the prisoners and unjust treatment/tactics are used. All of these points demonstrate why the Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed."
"
The debate topic is whether we should end affirmative action. The stance for those against this proposition is that affirmative action is necessary and should be maintained. Affirmative action is beneficial in promoting diversity, compensating for the past, and reducing discrimination. Evidence provided to support these claims includes a study that found a 23 percentage point decline in the likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban went into effect; Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, stated that affirmative action programs in education have been demonstrated to create equity and justice; the definition of affirmative action as any measure beyond termination of discriminatory practice to correct or prevent discrimination from occurring; President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 speech endorsing aggressive affirmative action; the Supreme Court upholding a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a manifest imbalance in job categories; and the National Organization for Women (NOW) stating that affirmative action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and business."

The debate is about whether we should end affirmative action or not. Supporters of ending affirmative action argue that it diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Evidence provided for the first claim include statements that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of those it is intended to help, which makes it counter-productive. Evidence provided for the second claim includes Arizona's 2010 constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action and that privileged African Americans gain professional upward mobility through affirmative action and equal opportunity sanctions in education and employment, leaving less-skilled, less-educated African Americans behind. Evidence for the third claim includes that race-blind admission testing could allow Asian American students, with top test scores in the country, a place at prestigious universities, but they are marked down on ""personality trait"" testing instead. For the fourth claim, evidence is provided of opponents who state that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination' and that such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional. The fifth claim has evidence of Clint Bolick of the Goldwater Institute stating that race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help. Additionally, data from the University of Texas show a wide variance in SAT scores and high-school grade-point averages among different races. In conclusion, there is strong evidence to support the claim that we should end affirmative action."

The debate material presents the topic 'We should end mandatory retirement'. The stance is that opponents of the topic argue that a mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers. Evidence 1 from the International Labour Organization in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people, as older workers are encouraged to leave the workforce and make room for younger workers. Evidence 2 from the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that mandatory retirement ages can promote intergenerational equity, as younger workers are given more opportunities to enter the workforce and build their careers. Thus, it can be argued that the benefits of mandatory retirement age create opportunities for other workers, as it helps boost employment for young people and promote intergenerational equity."
"
The debate topic is 'We should end mandatory retirement.' Its supporters argue that a mandatory retirement age is not beneficial to either employees or society, as it decreases institutional knowledge, harms the economy, is not fair or equitable, reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, and should not be imposed on those who are ready to retire. Evidence provided includes a UK example of no mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers, as well as studies from the World Economic Forum, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, American Association of Retired Persons, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization that provide evidence of the detriments of mandatory retirement, including decreased workforce diversity, labor force participation, age discrimination, decreased quality of life and well-being, and reduced economic well-being. Supporters argue that allowing people to retire when they are ready would support active aging, and give individuals greater control over their lives and allow them to pursue activities that bring them happiness and fulfillment."
"
This debate topic centers around the question of whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. The opponents of this motion argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence, providing evidence that deterrence has been a successful strategy in keeping peace for nearly 70 years, and that the invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. They further state that the possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them, as the West does not intervene in Ukraine and Moscow spares their territory. Therefore, the opponents of this motion assert that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence."
"
The debate topic is 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', with the positive stance arguing that these weapons can fall into the wrong hands and can provoke or escalate disastrous military action. Evidence to support these arguments includes recent propaganda from Isis which claims they could obtain nuclear weapons in the near future, showing that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare is not a top priority. Additionally, there is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons, and the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command, both of which could lead to catastrophic use of nuclear weapons. In support of the latter argument, it has been estimated that if a Soviet nuclear attack had occurred in the past, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets, resulting in 275 million deaths in Russia and China, as well as 100 million more in Eastern and Western European countries. Furthermore, in 2022, Russian President Mr Putin threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory, showing the potential for nuclear weapons to cause a disastrous military action. 

The arguments and evidence presented above demonstrate why we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons, which can fall into the wrong hands and provoke or escalate a disastrous military action."
"
The debate on whether we should fight urbanization or not has been ongoing for some time. Opponents of this stance have argued that cities offer more opportunities, as migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives. It has also been argued that urbanization benefits the economy, with new government policies encouraging the privatization of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment. Additionally, it has been argued that urbanization benefits the environment, as it drives innovation, including green technologies, and also brings higher productivity due to its positive externalities and economies of scale. Ultimately, urbanization should be embraced as it has the potential to offer more opportunities, benefit the economy, and have a positive effect on the environment."
"
In summary, the debate material supports the idea that we should fight urbanization. The supporters of this position provide four arguments: restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically and socially; urbanization causes crime; urbanization harms the environment; and urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources. To support these claims, evidence from different regions is presented such as how Venezuela has an urbanization rate of more than 85% and how rapid urbanization in India and New Zealand has caused social issues, criminal activities, pollution, inadequate housing, and lack of educational facilities. These findings demonstrate that it is necessary to fight urbanization in order to protect people in rural areas, prevent crime, preserve the environment, and reduce strain on resources."
"
The debate material discusses the topic of whether we should introduce compulsory voting. Opponents of this topic argue that abstention from a vote reflects one's preference, citizens have a right not to vote, and compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner. Evidence such as abstention being used to indicate mild disapproval, being a form of exercising one's right to vote, and compulsory voting being a form of compelled speech act, all support the opponents' claims that compulsory voting should not be introduced. Additionally, the evidence provided suggests that compulsory voting encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. Furthermore, it reduces the vote share of minor and extreme parties."
"
In summary, the debate is about introducing compulsory voting. Its proponents argue that this would increase representation, as it has been observed that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote in voluntary voting, skewing the political system further. This will also cause more people to become interested in politics, as they will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote. Furthermore, it has been ruled by the European Court of Human Rights that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, and research shows that compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout."
"
This debate topic is 'We should legalize cannabis'. The proponents of this stance argue that legalization can have numerous economic, social, and health benefits. The opponents argue that legalizing cannabis can cause harm to the body, lead to an increase in lack-of-judgement and accidents, be a gateway-drug that leads to addiction, and get in the hands of underage teenagers and children. 

Evidence supporting the opponents' claims include a 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore which found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Dutch research has also shown that an increase of THC content increases the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers. Harry Anslinger's campaign in the 1930s claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. A more recent study found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent. Also, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has stated that repeated marijuana use can lead to addiction. Finally, in response to the UK government's opposition to cannabis reclassification, prime minister Gordon Brown said that in any way, if we find cannabis acceptable, we are sending the wrong message, particularly to vulnerable young teenagers. 

Therefore, opponents of legalizing cannabis have substantial evidence that legalization could lead to health risks, a rise in lack-of-judgement and accidents, addiction, and access to the drug by underage individuals."
"
The debate topic is 'We should legalize cannabis'. Proponents of this stance argue that alcohol and tobacco, two substances known to be more harmful, are already legal; legalization of cannabis would be financially beneficial; cannabis is safe and has pain-relieving properties; it could be regulated if it was legalized and lastly, legalizing cannabis would reduce black-market activity. Evidence supporting these claims includes a 2002 DAWN report indicating that more than half a million deaths a year are caused by legal drugs while marijuana is not linked to any deaths; the fact that MDMA and cannabis have been exaggerated in terms of health risks while legal substances, like alcohol and tobacco, pose a greater health risk than cocaine; a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit indicating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion; the fact that vaporizers can release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating the ingestion of carcinogens; a letter to the FDA's commissioner expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement regarding medical cannabis; British Crime Survey statistics indicating that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased after the drug was downgraded to class C; and lastly, the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana. Based on this evidence, it is clear that there are strong arguments in favor of legalizing cannabis."
"
In conclusion, we can say that legalizing prostitution may lead to several unfavorable outcomes such as an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, immoral behaviors such as pimping, organized crime, and trafficking, and more violence against women. Evidence for these claims have been provided in the form of a survey conducted in Athens, reports of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, studies that showed the influx of organized crime and violence in the business, and reports of violence and exploitation against women. Ultimately, it is important to consider the potential consequences before legalizing prostitution."
"
In summary, the argument to support the claim that 'We should legalize prostitution' is that it would boost the economy, increase sex workers' benefits such as health care and unionization, allow for the profession to be regulated, and make it safer for women. It is also seen as a valid choice for those over their own bodies, as studies have shown it to have become normalized and providing benefits such as greater disposable income and access to upwardly mobile social circles. Examples of this are seen in Seattle by David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard and in Amsterdam by their court and sheriff. Furthermore, in the Netherlands the police only interfered when public order was at stake and in China in the 1990s, following the success of prevention interventions in Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors."
"
The debate over whether or not we should legalize sex selection revolves around the effects that it has on gender imbalance, gender stereotypes, and abortion/infanticide. Opponents of the legalization of sex selection claim that it can lead to gender imbalance. This is evident in countries like China and India, where the gender ratios are becoming increasingly skewed due to the preference for boys over girls. Furthermore, they argue that sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases, as son preference is still seen in more traditional families. Lastly, opponents argue that sex selection will lead to abortions and even infanticide, as couples may choose to abort pregnancies when they find out it is a female child."
"
Summary: 
The debate topic 'We should legalize sex selection' presents arguments for and against this topic. Supporters of legalizing sex selection argue that it is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of their child and it allows for better family planning, happiness, and the prevention of diseases and abortions. Evidence presented includes how parents often have a preference for the sex of their child, how gender selection helps prevent gender-specific diseases, and how it gives parents control over the number of children they want. It also helps prevent abortions and infanticide, especially in cases of gender-preference."
"
In conclusion, the argument over whether flag burning should be prohibited is a difficult one. The opponents of prohibition argue that flag burning is a form of expression protected under the First Amendment, citing Supreme Court cases such as the 1984 decision in Texas v. Johnson and the 1989 decision in United States v. Eichman as evidence. They believe that the right to express oneself in this way should be upheld, and that any attempts to ban it would be unconstitutional. On the other hand, supporters of prohibition believe that flag burning is offensive and disrespectful, and that the government has a legitimate interest in protecting its symbol. Ultimately, it is up to the court to decide what is and isn't protected by the First Amendment."
"
The debate topic is: 'We should prohibit flag burning'. The stance taken is in favour of the prohibition of flag burning. Supporters of this stance argue that flags are important symbols that should be respected, and that flag burning is an inflammatory act that deserves to be outlawed. Evidence supporting the claim that flags should be respected includes Warren's opinion that laws against flag burning are constitutional, and that by 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. As evidence that flag burning is an inflammatory act, it is pointed out that proponents of legislation argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture, and that in 2003, Khalid led a protest march that culminated with him burning the American flag. Therefore, it is argued that flag burning should be prohibited."
"
In summary, The opponents of the topic 'We should prohibit women in combat' argue that, due to the principle of equality between men and women enshrined in the European Treaties, women have been increasingly participating in economic activities, showing leadership and different skills and strategies that can make any infantry unit better. Studies also suggest that women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units and there are numerous examples of women serving in combat with extraordinary skill and courage. Furthermore, it has been shown that women can pass the same fitness tests as men and meet the standard in order to serve in combat roles. Ultimately, it should be up to the individual women if they choose to serve in combat."
"
In summary, the topic of the debate is whether or not we should prohibit women in combat. Supporters of the topic argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women due to their physical size, strength and stamina. Women cannot overcome physical, emotional and mental barriers that combat roles require, as they lack the strength, speed, and aerobic capacity of the average man. Additionally, women in combat can be a distraction to men, or a harm to the function of the military, as emotions may be heightened and the performance of the men may suffer. Supporters also suggest that women should serve in safer roles, and cite the example of Queen Elizabeth II who served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service as a mechanic. Finally, female soldier capture is a big concern as women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men, and any captured women may be subject to rape."
"
The debate topic is ""We should subsidize journalism"". This debate opposes subsidizing journalism, and the claim is that government intervention has the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. Supporting this claim, evidence shows that political endorsements can create favoritism in reporting, leading to a conflict of interest. Additionally, the Church of Scientology has previously complained that subsidies provide a safe harbor for biased journalism. Therefore, it can be argued that subsidizing journalism poses a risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity, and should not be done."
"
In the given debate topic, 'We should subsidize journalism', those who are in support of it claim that a subsidy is essential to make journalism viable as it has become increasingly difficult to filter the immense amount of information coming from the digital area. It is also necessary for information-spreading and accountability as it helps to produce a vast amount of factual reporting on state and national events. Moreover, providing subsidies to the media will also enhance the quality of journalism, as it will help create media-plural Europe which would better facilitate democratic decision-making and prevent the circulation of fake news. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) has also launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative to defend standards and raise awareness about the importance of quality journalism."
"
This debate is about whether or not we should subsidize space exploration. Proponents argue that space exploration should be funded because private sector companies like SpaceX have been able to carry out successful space missions, while opponents point out that space exploration is expensive and ineffective, as well as the fact that there are other issues that need funding. Evidence has been provided for all arguments, such as SpaceX’s success in its missions, the costs associated with space travel, the ineffectiveness of previous space exploration, and the existence of more pressing issues that should be addressed. Ultimately, the decision whether to subsidize space exploration is up to society to decide."
"
In conclusion, we should subsidize space exploration as it can help in colonizing other planets to provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for humans, as well as improve science and technology, create financial benefits, and unravel information about the universe. Space exploration can also help us develop technologies that can replicate and sustain life-giving essentials, such as water and air, off-world, and can help us harness a more sustainable world. Evidence for these claims includes the potential to supply clean energy, satellite imagery, climate data, and the data gathered from space missions which have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems."
"
In conclusion, the debate on whether or not we should subsidize vocational education is complex. Opponents of subsidizing vocational education claim that it can divert money from more worthy causes, is expensive, and can lead to an influx in those professions. Furthermore, they argue that vocational education is not a good career choice as it does not provide good transferability of skills and limited opportunities for advancement. Evidence for these claims include a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020, a study by the National Science Board in 2020, a report by the Center for American Progress in 2018, a study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020, and a report by the National Center for Education and the Economy in 2014. "
"
This debate topic focuses on whether we should subsidize vocational education. Supporters of the topic argue that subsidizing vocational education can promote those with fewer resources, better fit many students, provide a good career choice, and benefit the entire market and society. Evidence supporting these claims include a 2019 study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium which found that subsidizing vocational education can improve workforce development, particularly for individuals who face barriers to employment; a 2018 report by the Center for American Progress which found that it can better align with local labor market needs; a 2020 study by Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce which found that it provides a more direct path to employment; a 2022 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics which found that there is high demand for skilled workers in various industries; and a 2020 report by the National Skills Coalition which found that vocational education provides hands-on, practical learning, has shorter time to employment, addresses workforce shortages, and can enhance social mobility. Therefore, subsidizing vocational education can have numerous benefits and should be supported."
