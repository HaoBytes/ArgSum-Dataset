"Opponents of criminalizing assisted suicide make a strong case for personal autonomy and dignity in their arguments. They argue that assisted suicide ensures the preservation of personal dignity, which is affirmed by organizations like “Dignitas” in Europe and the “Washington Death with Dignity Act” in America, showing the concept's alignment with popular intuition. This alignment is further supported by academic defenses of assisted suicide, which frequently reference “death with dignity.” They also argue that assisted suicide can alleviate suffering, citing criteria of due care that healthcare professionals use to guide these decisions. These criteria are centered on the patient's unbearable suffering and the lack of reasonable alternatives, which underpins the potential for assisted suicide to alleviate suffering. The principle of autonomy is underscored by the argument that people should have the freedom to end their life. This is particularly evident in the practice of physician-assisted suicide or physician aid-in-dying (PAD), where physicians provide the means for competent, suffering patients to end their own life, a distinct practice from 'active euthanasia.’ Finally, opponents argue that the terminally ill, such as those facing progressive diseases, could significantly benefit from assisted suicide. This argument is exemplified by the personal accounts of individuals like Pratchett, who wished to resort to assisted suicide before his disease became critical."
"Supporters of criminalizing assisted suicide argue that assisted suicide has potential for misuse, allowing individuals to solicit death for their own benefit. They refer to certain stringent requirements, like the patient's long-term history with the doctor and permanent residency, as essential safeguards to prevent such misuse. They contend that assisted suicide may be resorted to prematurely, when patients could still recover. Instances of depression, fear of being a burden, or fear of dependency could be signs that not all therapeutic efforts have been exhausted, and assisted suicide may be seen as a premature solution. The role of healthcare professionals is another central point, as they argue that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role. The potential risks of doctors becoming facilitators of a patient's death are considered to significantly outweigh any potential benefits of assisted suicide. The argument extends to the constitutional realm, where they argue that individuals do not have the right to harm themselves or others, a claim backed by interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment. Lastly, they emphasize the potential for a slippery slope effect in the euthanasia debate. They argue that allowing physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia may lead to the acceptance of non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia, practices currently deemed unacceptable."
"Opponents of a homeschooling ban present a diverse range of arguments centered around individualization, safety, parental rights, and the potential benefits of a home learning environment. They cite examples of special education services and combined purchasing, arguing that homeschooling is the best option for exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students. They highlight the potential for homeschooling to be tailored to the child's pace and needs, as illustrated by Gosling's personal account of homeschooling fostering a strong sense of autonomy. Concerns about violence and bullying in mainstream schools form another crucial part of their argument. They advocate homeschooling as a safer alternative for children who may be at risk in the conventional school environment. The rights of parents to choose the education of their children form another core argument. They assert that homeschooling allows parents a deeper understanding of their children's progress and the liberty to integrate their familial and cultural values into the education process. They also argue that the home can be an effective learning environment, offering broader socialization and active learning opportunities that are not always possible in a typical classroom setting."
"Supporters of a ban on homeschooling point to stories like Vyckie Garrison's, a mother of seven who after 18 years of homeschooling, found herself unable to ensure a quality education for her children. Her struggle is a poignant reflection of the lack of standardization and regulation in homeschooling, especially as she lived in Nebraska, a state with little homeschooling regulation. Additionally, supporters assert that mainstream schools are indispensable for the development of crucial social skills. They illuminate the experiences unique to conventional schools, such as work experience opportunities, participation in sports leagues, and public recognition, which homeschooled children may not encounter. Quality of education is another major point of contention. Supporters often reference the opposition to homeschooling by established organizations like the National Education Association, illustrating their argument that mainstream schools provide a superior quality of education. Finally, they dispute the qualifications of parents as teachers. Referencing Professor Rob Reich's work, 'The Civic Perils of Homeschooling', supporters express concern over the potential for students to be exposed to a one-sided point of view, raising doubts about the educational soundness of homeschooling."
"The topic of mandatory routine child vaccinations is a hotly contested one. Those opposing it bring forth several reasons, starting with the potential dangers and side effects associated with vaccines. For instance, the Rotashield vaccine was withdrawn from the market after links to higher instances of bowel obstructions were discovered, providing a chilling example of how vaccines can sometimes go wrong. Opponents also argue that mandating vaccinations would infringe upon the basic rights of individuals. They cite the First Amendment of the US Constitution, arguing that the mandate could interfere with the right to exercise personal and religious beliefs freely. The necessity of vaccinations is another point of contention. Critics point out that, according to the Mayo Clinic, natural infection often provides more robust immunity than a series of vaccinations, challenging the idea that routine vaccinations are essential to keep children healthy."
"Supporters of mandatory child vaccinations present compelling counter-arguments. They emphasize the efficacy of vaccines, like the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which led to a 69% drop in invasive pneumococcal disease rates in children under two within a year of its introduction. Supporters also underline the life-saving potential of vaccines. An estimation suggests that full vaccination of all US children born in a given year could prevent 14 million infections and save 33,000 lives, highlighting the profound impact of vaccinations. They argue for the larger societal good, stating that routine vaccinations protect not only the individual but the community at large. This point is illustrated by a case where an unvaccinated teenager from the US contracted measles during a visit to Romania and, upon return, triggered an outbreak in a community of unvaccinated children. Moreover, they insist on mandatory vaccinations to prevent the spread of deadly diseases, a strategy proven effective by the eradication of smallpox - a disease that had claimed millions of lives before its eradication. Lastly, supporters maintain an ethical standpoint, insisting that children should not have to suffer from diseases that are easily preventable by vaccines, given that vaccine-preventable diseases cause an estimated three million childhood deaths each year."
"Opponents of government regulation of social media platforms construct their argument on five main claims. The first claim states that such regulation is ineffective, exemplified by the little action taken against Facebook, Google, and others over their data-collection practices since the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (G.D.P.R.) in 2018. Secondly, critics argue that regulation infringes on privacy, citing a Pew Research Center survey that shows many people feel they have little control over how their personal information is used. Thirdly, they claim that regulation compromises freedom of speech and other democratic rights. This is illustrated by Facebook's significant restriction on Vietnamese content after Vietnam's 2018 cybersecurity law, an act that has been criticized for threatening press freedom. Fourthly, opponents assert that government intervention in the affairs of private companies, like social media platforms, could lead to excess bureaucracy and inefficiency. Lastly, critics caution that regulation could lead to political abuses by the government, pointing to the polarization of voters, lower trust in institutions, and degradation of democracy seen in past politically targeted advertisements."
"Supporters of government regulation of social media platforms present five key arguments. The first is that regulation safeguards younger audiences, citing an official statement advocating for an independent, statutory regulator to ensure online safety for young people. Secondly, they argue that regulation is essential to combat fake news, referencing a statistic revealing that a majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information. Thirdly, supporters believe regulation benefits society at large, highlighted by proposed legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) that aim to increase transparency and limit psychologically manipulative techniques on social media platforms. Fourthly, proponents contend that regulation can manage negative content, supported by the endorsement of upcoming legislation by the CEO of safety technology company Safe To Net. Lastly, they state that regulation is necessary to deal with malicious users, evidenced by a Pew Trust report showing that 13% of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by unauthorized users."
"Opponents of the claim that the USA is a good country to live in build their argument on seven claims. First, they criticize the country's health and education policies, citing disparities in healthcare affordability between different racial groups. Second, they highlight problems with the divisive political system, referring to intensified divisions between the two major political parties. Third, they express concerns over the negative culture, using a statement by Tina Marie Griffin on the misuse of digital technology, the spread of false information, and other social pressures. Fourth, they point out the high taxation and cost of living, exemplified by the tax situation for struggling families in Manhattan. Fifth, they emphasize issues of inequality and poverty, illustrated by the fact that 750,000 Americans are homeless on any given night. Sixth, they discuss safety concerns, citing a poll where 65% of people in the USA were worried about violent crime. Finally, they argue that the country is xenophobic/racist, referring to the significant number of hate crimes and racial slurs experienced by Asian Americans since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Supporters of the position that the USA is a good country to live in base their argument on several key claims, each supported by credible evidence. Firstly, the argument is made that the US has a high standard of living and a robust economy, evidenced by the fact that in 2015, income per capita was $56,300, which is amongst the highest in the developed world. Secondly, they assert that the US has robust health and education systems. As proof, they point out that 40 out of the top 100 universities in a 2014 global survey are based in the US, with 7 in the top 10, suggesting that US diplomas are highly regarded by employers globally. They also argue that the country is rich in natural beauty, using John Muir's famous description of Yosemite as nature’s temple as an example. Moreover, the USA's democratic rights and freedoms are emphasized, as the country's Declaration of Independence is regarded as the first civic document that meets a modern definition of human rights, as stated in the Human Rights: The Essential Reference. The country's multicultural society and cultural richness are also highlighted, with the argument that American culture has been influenced by various regions worldwide, including English, Indigenous Americans, Latin Americans, Africans, and Asians, as reported by the Library of Congress. The claim that the US is a powerful country is backed by the fact that it has been ranked as the world's most powerful country seven times, as per the rankings by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and US News & World Report. Finally, they argue that the US offers unmatched opportunities for individuals, pointing out that most of the world's largest companies have offices in the US, thus providing unique career opportunities that can be life-changing."
"Opponents of the idea that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned make several key claims, supported by relevant evidence. First, they argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, with Paul teaching that by freeing himself from other obligations, a priest can devote himself more fully to God. Second, they suggest that celibacy is a deeply held religious belief, as underlined by the encyclical written by Pope Paul VI, 'Sacerdotalis caelibatus', which is Latin for 'Of priestly celibacy'. They further argue that celibacy contributes to priests' holiness, as a priest's love that chooses a celibate life draws from God and is as demanding and real as any other genuine love. Fourth, they claim that priests consciously choose to be celibates, as seen in the example of several religious figures who have publicly taken vows of celibacy. Fifth, they uphold that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, arguing that clerical continence is part of an immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. Lastly, they express concern that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, with the Archbishop of Vienna making a connection between celibacy and the sex abuse scandals in the Catholic church."
"In the debate on the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', the proponents articulate their stance with the following arguments and evidence. Firstly, they posit that celibacy is outdated. This is backed by historical evidence where Pope Paul III commuted the vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity for the knights of the order in 1540, indicating a precedent of modification to the rule in line with societal evolution. Secondly, they contend that celibacy can be excessively pressuring and difficult. A real-life testimony by Jimmy O'Brien highlights the psychological strain, describing celibacy as a lifestyle made difficult by sexual chemistry and the lack of a life partner. Thirdly, proponents argue that celibacy is unhealthy and unnatural. They underscore the basic biological principle that all living organisms are biologically programmed to reproduce, implying that celibacy goes against this natural imperative. Fourthly, they claim that celibacy can lead to inappropriate sexual behavior, pointing to the alarming statistic that in 2004, over 1,000 allegations of sexual abuse were made against Catholic priests and deacons in the U.S. Lastly, the argument is made that celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. This is supported by the statement of Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck, an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, who endorsed the ordination of women and cessation of clerical celibacy in response to a shortage of priests."
"In the debate on the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', opponents argue with the following points and supporting evidence. Firstly, they assert that marriage is beneficial for children. Evidence presented reveals that children profit from gender-specific support a mother and father can provide. Research indicates that the distinctive roles of mothers and fathers, as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are crucial for child development. Secondly, they uphold that marriage is significant for individuals, either for general reasons or due to religious/traditional beliefs. They use strong evidence showing that children raised in a healthy marriage witness and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family, thereby emphasizing the societal importance of this institution. Thirdly, they propose that marriage enhances happiness. This claim is backed by research indicating that married people are generally happier than those who are not married. Fourthly, they state that marriage makes couples closer. They cite a survey that found married adults were more satisfied with their relationships and had greater trust in their partners than cohabiting couples. Lastly, they argue that marriage provides key financial benefits. They provide multiple examples, including potential tax benefits, enhanced savings opportunities, better insurance options, and long-term social security benefits, demonstrating that marriage can confer significant financial advantages."
"In the debate on the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', the proponents make the following arguments backed by evidence. Firstly, they claim that marriage perpetuates harmful norms for women. They support this assertion with evidence highlighting the imposition of rigid gender roles in marriage. Women are often expected to be submissive to male family members, conform to their wishes, and forego equal decision-making. They face potential physical violence if they deviate from these norms. Secondly, they argue that marriages are unstable. This is supported by data from the United Nations, which indicates a global increase in divorce rates since the 1970s. The proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s, demonstrating the instability inherent in modern marriages. Thirdly, proponents contend that marriage binds individuals with unfair obligations. An example from Qatar's laws is provided as evidence, where women need male guardian permission to marry, to work, or even to travel. If women are deemed disobedient for not obtaining their husband's permission for these actions, they can lose their right to financial support, illustrating the potential for institutionalized inequity in marriage. Finally, they argue that most advantages of marriage can be achieved in a monogamous relationship without the formal institution of marriage. This claim is backed by the observation that monogamy is ingrained into many societies and is seen as a dominant approach to love and partnership, suggesting that the emotional and social benefits of marriage can be realized without the contractual binding."
"In the debate regarding the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', those opposed to the idea present the following arguments with supporting evidence. The first claim is that children can still express themselves using other means, even with uniforms. A former student from Hershey High School backs this assertion, arguing that uniforms do not suppress individuality. Students can still express their personalities through various items such as buttons or jewelry. The second claim states that school uniforms reduce instances of bullying. The Department of Education (DofE) presents evidence that schools strictly enforcing uniform policies have fewer incidents of bullying. This is because potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who are often children who do not fit in. Thirdly, it's argued that school uniforms create a sense of equality and unity among students. The reasoning is that uniforms not only standardize appearances but also instill a sense of community and belonging. This sense of unity boosts school pride and spirit. The fourth claim suggests that school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning. There is evidence that students in uniforms are more academically focused, which minimizes disciplinary problems and allows teachers to focus on teaching rather than dress code enforcement. Lastly, opponents argue that school uniforms save costs. A recent NY Post article suggests that families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes. Over a 12-year career, this can amount to significant savings, which can be utilized towards college expenses."
"Conversely, the proponents for abandoning school uniforms argue as follows. First, they claim that school uniforms harm learning and creativity. This is supported by Tara Maginnis Ph.D., who argues that uniforms convey the message that conformity is prioritized over creativity, stifling students' right to expression. Secondly, they claim that school uniforms harm students' self-expression. A study from Arizona State University supports this argument, showing that students without school uniforms had a higher self-perception. Thirdly, proponents assert that school uniforms are expensive. This adds a financial burden on families already struggling with the increasing costs of bills and essential items. Fourth, they argue that school uniforms are often uncomfortable and promote sexist standards. A GLSEN study provides evidence that a significant percentage of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes thought to be of another gender, limiting their comfort and expression. Finally, they claim that school uniforms increase conformity and harm individuality. Research indicates that allowing kids and teens to dress as they choose not only fosters independent thinking but also prepares them for adulthood where they have to adapt to varying social standards and contexts."
"In the debate surrounding the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', those against the proposition offer the following arguments and evidence. The first claim is that the death penalty helps victims and their families. This point is supported by Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, who believes that enforcing capital punishment is a step closer to providing justice and closure for victims' families and loved ones. The second claim posits that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes. The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights argues that capital punishment for severe crimes has become a part of customary international law. Lastly, opponents suggest that the death penalty helps prevent crimes. David Muhlhausen, PhD, a Research Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, argues that capital punishment acts as a deterrent, with studies showing a consistent link between executions and reduced murder rates, effectively saving lives."
"On the other hand, proponents for the abolition of capital punishment present their case as follows. The first claim is that state-sanctioned killing is principally wrong. Evidence indicates that the application of the death penalty in the US is unfair and unjust, disproportionately affecting people based on their financial status, the quality of their legal representation, the victim's race, and the crime's location. Additionally, there is a risk of executing innocent people, with over 156 people having been released from death rows due to proven innocence since 1973. Secondly, they assert that the death penalty harms the disenfranchised. A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts shows that the cost of a federal death penalty case is significantly higher than that of a non-death penalty case, diverting resources that could be allocated to programs better suited for increasing public safety, health, and welfare. Lastly, they argue that the death penalty is irreversible and does not effectively deter crime. Freelance author Emmaline Soken-Huberty supports this argument by stating that no studies show capital punishment as a deterrent. In fact, states without the death penalty have lower murder rates. Therefore, she concludes, given the death penalty's risk to innocent lives and lack of crime prevention efficacy, it should be abolished."

Therefore, she concludes, given the death penalty's risk to innocent lives and lack of crime prevention efficacy, it should be abolished."
"The debate around the topic: 'We should abolish intellectual property rights' is both contentious and complex. Opponents of the proposition contend that: Firstly, intellectual property rights incentivize creativity and innovation. The International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) asserts that intellectual property encourages the development of new varieties of plants for societal benefit. Secondly, intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products. Many economists maintain that in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, commercial organizations would have insufficient incentives to produce various types of intangible assets. Thirdly, intellectual property rights protect against theft. Senator Leahy argues that to maintain leadership in producing intellectual property, we must protect Americans' rights to their property. Finally, they argue that individuals or businesses should be compensated for their innovations. Intellectual property rights enable compensation for the utilization of standards developed by an entity, either for free under reasonable conditions or for a reasonable fee."
"On the contrary, proponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that: Firstly, intellectual property prevents the continuous improvement of a product or service. Evidence suggests that the assertion of intellectual property rights, as in the case of Fox Talbot in 1852, can hinder the development of industries, like photography. Secondly, intellectual property restricts access to vital information or products. Professor Lessig critiques the modern law-making process, claiming it has been hijacked by corporations more interested in capital accumulation than the free exchange of ideas. Thirdly, they argue that intellectual property rights are unfair. The People's Health Movement (PHM) considers the agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) as unjust and against the interests of developing countries and poor patients. Fourthly, intellectual property rights can harm creativity and innovation. Again citing the case of Fox Talbot in 1852, proponents argue that the insistence on economic rights in intellectual property can hamper development. Fifthly, intellectual property rights are a waste of money. Initial protection can be expensive, especially for complex products involving methods, designs, and processes. Finally, they posit that intellectual property rights are ineffective. Some argue that unlike physical property, intellectual property isn't scarce and its legal protection is a fiction created by the state."
"The debate on the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms' can be intense and multifaceted.  Opponents of the proposition argue that: Firstly, gun control is ineffective. They point to a 2016 Obama administration study which found that only about 10.1% of prison inmates obtained their firearms through a retail source, implying the majority of firearms used in crimes are obtained illegally, regardless of gun laws. Secondly, they contend that gun ownership is a right. They cite the U.S. Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller, which reaffirmed the Second Amendment as establishing an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms. Thirdly, they argue that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sport shooting. They support this claim with data from 2016 showing approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, with more than half of all hunters participating in target shooting. Finally, they argue that gun ownership promotes self-protection. A 2019 Gallup survey found that 63% of gun owners cited personal safety or protection as their primary reason for owning a firearm."
"On the contrary, proponents of abolishing the right to keep and bear arms argue that: Firstly, banning guns would save lives. They refer to a study in the American Journal of Public Health which found that the legal purchase of a handgun is associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death. Secondly, they argue that gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence. They refer to a 1993 study in The New England Journal of Medicine, which found that guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance. Thirdly, they assert that guns can fall into the wrong hands. They point to the example of the Sutherland Springs church massacre, where 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns. Lastly, they argue that guns lead to accidental deaths, especially among those under 25 years old. They highlight data from 2022 showing that 209 children have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured, underscoring the risk of accidents associated with firearms."
"We firmly oppose the adoption of an austerity regime. We argue that it can cut access to essential services, extend recessions, treat citizens unfairly, result in lower economic growth, and reduce job creation. First, we assert that austerity cuts access to essential services. Nationally, local authority budgets were cut by nearly a third from 2010 to 2018 in the UK, and the public health grant fell by £700m in real terms between 2014/15 and 2019/20, leading to the degradation of vital public services. Second, we argue that austerity extends recessions. The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has been controversial due to their contractionary effects, often exacerbating ongoing economic recessions. Third, we maintain that austerity is unfair to citizens. Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, declared that levels of child poverty in the UK are 'a social calamity and an economic disaster'. Fourth, we contend that austerity results in lower economic growth. Greece's recent austerity program drastically decreased its deficit but disastrously failed to heal the economy. Lastly, austerity leads to lower job creation. Alessandro Turrini found that austerity policies could lead to higher unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation due to lower job creation levels. Given these reasons and supporting evidence, we strongly argue against the adoption of an austerity regime."
"We stand in favor of adopting an austerity regime, arguing that it improves economic measures, is crucial in the long term, increases stability, is necessary for deficit reduction or debt payment, and is essential during economically troubled times. First, we believe that austerity improves economic measures. The recent rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia demonstrates that countries pursuing fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. Second, we argue that austerity is important in the long term. Cutting budget deficits can boost investors' confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. The EU commission pointed to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg, and Sweden as proof that austerity measures work. Third, we assert that austerity is vital to increase stability. Austerity measures and pro-market reforms in Morocco in the 1980s have been credited with economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual decrease in unemployment. Fourth, we posit that austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts. A World Bank study found that a debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 77% for an extended period slows economic growth, indicating the need for austerity to keep debt levels in check. Lastly, we maintain that an austerity regime is crucial during economically troubled times. The global economic downturn that began in 2008 led several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, to turn to austerity to alleviate budget concerns. In light of these arguments and supporting evidence, we advocate for the adoption of an austerity regime."
"We are here to argue against the proposition of adopting atheism, asserting that it discriminates against religious people, potentially lacks morality, and usurps the individual's choice in matters of personal belief. First, we maintain that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. Historical advocate of tolerance, John Locke, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, arguing that the denial of God's existence could potentially undermine the social order and lead to chaos. Second, we argue that atheism can lack a coherent basis for morality. Evangelical theologian Douglas Wilson posits that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for individuals to rationally account for why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life. Finally, we contend that the decision to adopt atheism should be left to the individual. Liddle maintains that belief in God or the lack thereof is a matter of personal choice and cannot be conclusively proven either way by scientific means. Considering these reasons and supporting evidence, we strongly argue against the adoption of atheism."
"We stand in favor of adopting atheism. We believe that atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it, justified by the lack of proof for God's existence, allows individuals to step away from potentially immoral religious doctrines, and that science can adequately explain the universe. First, we assert that atheism is beneficial to the person who adopts it. Baggini argues that atheism provides a superior basis for ethics, as it encourages individuals to evaluate moral imperatives themselves rather than blindly following religious doctrine. Second, we argue that atheism should be adopted due to the lack of concrete proof for God's existence. Atheist Michael Scriven maintains that atheism is justified in the absence of any evidence for God's existence. Third, we contend that religions can be immoral and should not always be followed. We believe that morality requires thinking about the consequences of actions and how they affect others. Blind obedience to rules without considering their impact can be seen as amoral, if not irresponsible. Finally, we posit that science can adequately explain the universe. Chapman, despite criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, concedes that religious atheism may represent a mature perspective that looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. In light of these arguments and supporting evidence, we advocate for the adoption of atheism."
"We argue against the notion that libertarianism should be adopted, based on the premise that it could harm economic growth, infringe on the rights of minorities, promote injustice and inequality, remove essential laws and infrastructure, and undermine the essential role of the government. Firstly, we posit that libertarianism harms economic growth. The failure of Northern Rock, a devastating economic event that led to a loss of £27 billion, was linked by environmentalist George Monbiot to Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy. Secondly, we assert that libertarianism can harm minorities and those worse off. Philosopher Robert Nozick, an advocate of right-libertarianism, suggests that a consistently libertarian society might even validate consensual enslavement contracts, thereby rejecting inalienable rights. Next, we argue that libertarianism may foster injustice and inequality. Critics like economist Joseph Stiglitz argue that market-based solutions often fail to address important social needs and can lead to unequal outcomes, necessitating government intervention. Moreover, we contend that libertarianism can strip away essential laws, infrastructure, and government services. Proponents of libertarianism often support the legalization of what are perceived as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution. Lastly, we affirm that the government plays a crucial role in protecting the rights of its citizens. Human Rights Watch highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups. Given these reasons and the supporting evidence, we strongly oppose the adoption of libertarianism."
"We stand in favor of adopting libertarianism, arguing that it spurs economic growth, increases political freedom, promotes happiness and fulfillment, and enhances individual liberties. First, we contend that libertarianism increases economic growth. Sustainability advocates such as Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins argue that combining elements of libertarianism and green politics can yield both economic and environmental benefits. Second, we maintain that libertarianism boosts freedom in the political system. Libertarians argue that limiting government intervention increases individual freedom. The Cato Institute found that countries with less government intervention generally experience higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth. Third, we assert that libertarianism enhances happiness and fulfillment. By allowing individuals to make their own decisions, libertarians believe people are better able to pursue their interests and goals. Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when engaged in fulfilling and meaningful activities. Finally, we argue that libertarianism increases individual liberties. Sunstein and Thaler, in support of libertarianism, insist that people should be free to do as they please and opt out of undesirable arrangements if they wish. Given these arguments and the supporting evidence, we advocate for the adoption of libertarianism."
"We argue against the motion to ban human cloning, pointing to its potential benefits such as organ replication, aiding in reproduction, promoting health, and advancing scientific research. Firstly, we maintain that cloning can address the critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, as highlighted by the World Health Organization. Cloning has the potential to save lives that are currently lost due to the lack of suitable organs for transplantation. Secondly, we argue that cloning offers a solution to those unable to have children naturally. According to a study by the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, cloning can create a child genetically related to one of the parents, providing a lifeline for infertile couples. Thirdly, we propose that cloning can significantly benefit public health. A study in the Nature journal attests to the potential of cloning in advancing stem cell research, potentially treating a range of diseases. Lastly, we assert that cloning can be instrumental in promoting science and research. New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 specifically allowed human cloning for developing and harvesting human stem cells, demonstrating the acknowledgment of cloning's scientific significance. Given these reasons and the supporting evidence, we argue against banning human cloning."
"We firmly support the motion that human cloning should be banned. Our stance is rooted in the belief that cloning is insufficiently understood, potentially unethical, unnatural, and unsafe. Our first contention is that cloning is not well enough understood yet. As Leon Kass suggests, a society that allows cloning risks devaluing human procreation and viewing children as mere products of our will. Secondly, we argue that cloning is unethical and could contradict religious beliefs. Pope John Paul II declared that techniques involving the manipulation and destruction of human embryos are not morally acceptable, even with a good intended goal. Thirdly, we maintain that cloning is unnatural. Rev. Demetri Demopulos, a Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist, argues that human beings are meant to be created through acts of love, not through cellular manipulation. Lastly, we posit that cloning is unsafe. Dr. Phil Noguchi from the FDA warns that human cloning risks transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newborn child, pointing towards a potential health hazard. Given these arguments and the supporting evidence, we stand firm on our position that human cloning should be banned."
"We contest the motion to ban private military companies. We believe that these companies provide valuable benefits including financial efficiency, specialized training, provision of skills not present in regular armies, and increased safety. Our first argument is that hiring private military companies can be financially beneficial. A study published in Defense and Security Analysis in 2011 demonstrated that these companies can efficiently adapt to changing circumstances, offering a cost-effective solution compared to traditional military personnel. Secondly, we contend that private military companies offer well-trained and better-equipped personnel. The Congressional Research Service in 2009 attested to their specialized training programs, which keep them updated with the latest tactics and techniques. Thirdly, we argue that these companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies are unable or unwilling to do. The same study from Defense and Security Analysis found that these companies offer specialized skills and expertise that might be lacking in the regular army. Lastly, we maintain that private military companies can increase safety. According to a report by the Heritage Foundation, these companies can efficiently use resources, thus reducing the overall cost of military operations and allowing a greater focus on safety. Given these arguments and the supporting evidence, we strongly oppose the notion of banning private military companies."
"We wholeheartedly support the motion to ban private military companies. We base our argument on the grounds that these companies often exhibit less ethical behavior, lack professionalism, have questionable loyalty, prioritize profit over integrity, and may incite or prolong conflicts. Our first contention is that private military companies are often less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes. The United Nations reported in 2004 that these companies had used child soldiers in conflict zones. Secondly, we argue that private military companies lack professionalism. A report by Amnesty International in 2009 indicated that these companies have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, leading to increased risk and a drop in professionalism in their operations. Thirdly, we maintain that these companies cannot be trusted to remain loyal to the hiring country. A study in the Journal of Military Ethics in 2009 found that these companies can face a conflict of interest if they have loyalty to multiple countries. Fourthly, we assert that private military companies primarily focus on profit, often at the expense of ethical conduct. A study in International Affairs in 2010 showed that these companies often operate with limited accountability, impeding efforts to hold them responsible for profit-driven actions. Lastly, we posit that private military companies may provoke or prolong conflicts for their financial gain. The Project on Government Oversight in 2008 found that these companies have a financial incentive to prolong conflicts due to their continued involvement. Given these compelling arguments and evidence, we stand firmly with the motion to ban private military companies."
"We contest the motion to ban the use of child actors. We argue that acting can be a child's passion, that child performers can achieve success, that they provide diversity in casting, that they can thrive under proper supervision, and that their involvement in acting should be a decision made by their parents. Our first argument is that acting can be a child's dream. The Drama Teachers Association of America found that many children have a natural talent for acting, and may even aspire to make it their career. Secondly, we argue that child performers can gain success and confidence through acting. For instance, Ashwin Chitale received the best child artist award. Thirdly, we maintain that child actors are necessary for certain roles. The National Association of Theatre Owners found that child actors diversify casting and create opportunities for more actors, including children. Our fourth argument posits that child performers can thrive as long as there is adequate supervision and regulation. For example, Walsh collaborated with child actors to illustrate potential dangers and the solutions children can seek. Lastly, we argue that parents should have the autonomy to decide for their child. The Journal of Family Psychology found that parents are capable of providing individualized attention and care crucial for the child's development and well-being. Given these compelling arguments and evidence, we stand firmly against the motion to ban the use of child actors."
"We ardently support the motion to ban the use of child actors. We argue that being a performer negatively impacts the child's education, exposes them to the risk of exploitation, results in the loss of their childhood, puts them under intense pressure, and may lead to problems later in life. Our first contention is that being a performer can harm a child's education. The Journal of Education and Practice found that child performers often miss school or receive inadequate education, compromising their basic skills and knowledge. Secondly, we argue that child performers are at risk of exploitation. A study in the Journal of Adolescence highlighted that child performers often face labor violations, including wage theft and poor working conditions. Thirdly, we maintain that child performers are often robbed of their childhood. UNICEF reported that child actors are often exploited and exposed to unhealthy working conditions, leading to a loss of childhood experiences. Fourthly, we posit that child actors face immense pressure. A study in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence found that child performers might develop mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, due to work-related stress. Lastly, we contend that child actors often develop problems later in life. The story of Herbert, a child actor who faced difficulties adjusting to life beyond the studio, illustrates this point. Given these compelling arguments and supporting evidence, we strongly stand with the motion to ban the use of child actors."
"We argue against the motion to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. We posit that the camp is essential for national security, provides better conditions than alternatives, and plays a crucial role in gathering intelligence. Firstly, closing Guantanamo Bay could risk national security. The Director of National Intelligence reports that around 17.5 percent of transferred detainees reengage in terrorist activities. This implies a significant threat of terrorism resurgence. Secondly, Guantanamo Bay offers superior conditions for detainees than alternative detention centers. As per various sources, including human rights organizations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, the facility adheres to the Geneva Convention and exceeds the standards of maximum-security prisons worldwide. Thirdly, the detention camp is a crucial asset for intelligence gathering in the war against terror. Its strategic position and design make it a valuable source of insight into Al Qaeda's operations, further enhancing the United States' counterterrorism efforts. Given these reasons, we firmly oppose the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp."
"We ardently support the motion to close Guantanamo Bay detention camp. We assert that detainees should have access to US courts, the camp tarnishes US image and reputation, it symbolizes discrimination and injustice, it drains significant financial resources, its personnel commit crimes, and it employs unjust treatment tactics. Firstly, we argue that detainees deserve a trial in U.S courts. The Supreme Court ruled that Guantanamo detainees have rights under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision, reaffirming the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty.’ Secondly, the detention camp damages the reputation of the United States. As a symbol of lawlessness, Guantanamo undermines our commitment to the rule of law and serves as a recruitment tool for terrorists. Thirdly, Guantanamo represents a symbol of injustice and discrimination. Originally set up as an 'island outside the law,' it has devolved into a symbol of abuse and disregard for the rule of law. Fourthly, maintaining Guantanamo Bay is exorbitantly expensive. With costs exceeding $540 million annually, the facility's operation drains resources that could be better utilized elsewhere. Fifthly, Guantanamo personnel have been accused of committing crimes against detainees. Reports of abuse, torture, and inhumane treatment reinforce the need for closure. Lastly, the camp uses unjust treatment and interrogation tactics. Approval of techniques such as stress positions, isolation, deprivation of stimuli, and 20-hour interrogations violates international human rights norms. Considering these compelling arguments, we strongly urge the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp."
"We stand against the motion to end affirmative action. We believe that affirmative action enhances diversity, compensates for past discrimination, and reduces ongoing discriminatory practices. Our first point is that affirmative action fosters diversity. Studies show a significant decline in admission of students of color in highly selective colleges following an affirmative action ban, highlighting its crucial role in promoting diversity. Secondly, affirmative action serves as a necessary corrective for historical and ongoing discrimination. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights clearly defined affirmative action as a measure adopted not just to end discriminatory practices, but to rectify their consequences. Finally, affirmative action aids in reducing discrimination in society. As validated by the case of Johnson v. Transportation Agency, affirmative action corrects 'manifest imbalance' in traditionally segregated job categories, thereby actively combating discrimination. We argue that, given its vital role in promoting diversity and combating discrimination, affirmative action should be maintained."
"We ardently support the motion to end affirmative action. We maintain that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, unjust, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Firstly, we argue that affirmative action undermines the achievements of minorities. The perception that minority accomplishments are due to affirmative action rather than merit fosters disrespect and devalues their genuine efforts. Secondly, affirmative action's efficacy is questionable. As seen with the passing of Arizona's Proposition 107, which bans government-sponsored affirmative action, there is growing consensus that it may not be the most effective approach. Thirdly, affirmative action may sometimes result in unjust practices. An example is the alleged discrimination against Asian-American students by Harvard University, implying a need for race-blind admission processes. Fourthly, affirmative action can ironically perpetuate prejudice. It is sometimes perceived as 'reverse discrimination,' causing resentment and exacerbating divisions in society. Lastly, affirmative action can reduce quality by ignoring merit. As Clint Bolick of the Goldwater Institute pointed out, race-based affirmative action programs may overlook more qualified candidates, thereby perpetuating a fraud on the groups they aim to help. Considering these compelling reasons, we firmly advocate for the end of affirmative action."
"We stand against the motion to end mandatory retirement. We believe that mandatory retirement helps in creating opportunities for young workers, and it offers financial security to those approaching retirement. Our first argument is that mandatory retirement facilitates opportunities for younger employees. The International Labour Organization found that mandatory retirement encourages older workers to exit the workforce, creating room for the next generation. Secondly, mandatory retirement contributes to the financial security of retirees. The Employee Benefit Research Institute reported that mandatory retirement allows individuals to access pension and other benefits at a specified age, enhancing their financial stability in their post-work years. Considering these points, we argue that mandatory retirement serves to balance the workforce while providing assurance for those leaving it."
"We wholeheartedly support the motion to end mandatory retirement. We hold that mandatory retirement erodes institutional knowledge, potentially harms the economy, exhibits age discrimination, reduces quality of life, and undermines the principle of retiring when ready. Firstly, we assert that mandatory retirement drains institutional knowledge. For instance, in the UK, there is no mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers, acknowledging the value of their accumulated experience. Secondly, mandatory retirement can negatively impact the economy. The World Economic Forum found that mandatory retirement impedes workforce diversity, thus limiting the range of skills and experiences available in the workplace. Thirdly, mandatory retirement could potentially result in age discrimination. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) reported that forcing older workers to retire irrespective of their ability contributes to ageist practices. Fourthly, mandatory retirement can lead to a decline in quality of life. Research from The American Economic Review suggests that health deteriorates post mandatory retirement, indicating reduced life quality. Lastly, we advocate for the principle of retiring when one is ready. The AARP supports this notion, asserting that active aging is fostered when people are allowed to retire on their own terms, contributing their skills and experiences for society's benefit. In light of these arguments, we firmly advocate for ending mandatory retirement."
"We oppose the motion to abolish nuclear weapons. Our stance is based on the premise that nuclear weapons play an essential role in protection and deterrence. Our argument revolves around the significant role of nuclear weapons in maintaining peace through deterrence. Deterrence is a strategy designed to discourage an entity from taking specific actions. This approach, largely enabled by nuclear weapons, has been pivotal in maintaining global peace for almost seven decades. To sum up, we argue that the abolition of nuclear weapons would disturb the existing balance of power and potentially jeopardize peace."
"We vehemently support the motion to abolish nuclear weapons, based on the risks posed by such weapons falling into the wrong hands and the potential for provoking catastrophic military conflicts. Our first argument concerns the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands. Recent propaganda from ISIS has even suggested that they could acquire nuclear weapons within a year. This highlights the pressing need for global efforts to prevent such disastrous outcomes. Secondly, we assert that nuclear weapons can provoke or escalate disastrous military action. For instance, during the Cold War, had there been a Soviet nuclear attack, the U.S. would have launched over 3,200 nuclear weapons, resulting in estimated hundreds of millions of deaths and devastating fallout. Given these potential risks, we advocate for the abolition of nuclear weapons in order to safeguard humanity from such calamities."
"We stand against the motion to fight urbanization, given the opportunities, economic benefits, and environmental advantages it provides. Firstly, cities offer more opportunities, acting as magnets for those seeking better lives, thereby fostering diversity and cultural exchange. Secondly, urbanization significantly benefits the economy. A prime example is China's shift towards privatization and urbanization, which led to an influx of international investment and significant economic development. Thirdly, urbanization can be beneficial for the environment. Urban environments drive innovation, including the development of green technologies that hold the promise for a more sustainable future. Considering these points, we believe that rather than fighting urbanization, we should work towards making it more sustainable and inclusive."
"We stand firmly for the motion to combat urbanization. We believe it results in adverse socio-economic impacts, exacerbates crime rates, harms the environment, and overburdens city resources. Firstly, restrictions on migration could provide economic and social benefits to rural areas. As evidence, Venezuela's rural areas witnessed severe economic disinvestment and neglect following urbanization due to oil wealth discoveries, transforming it into a net food importer despite its fertile lands. Secondly, urbanization leads to a surge in crime rates. The social issues arising from urban migration, such as a rise in urban crime, poverty, and health problems, were evident in the experiences of Māori leaders and government policymakers. Thirdly, urbanization is harmful to the environment. The pollution of clean water supplies due to increasing urbanization is a prominent example. Lastly, urbanization places a massive strain on city resources. The UNESCO report highlighted the negative effects of overurbanization, including inadequate housing, absence of sanitary facilities, and limited access to educational facilities. In light of these reasons, we advocate for resisting the tide of urbanization to protect our rural areas, environment, and city resources."
"We oppose the notion of compulsory voting. Our stand is based on the freedom of expression, the right to abstain, and the potential for uninformed voting. Firstly, abstaining from voting is a way to express one's preferences. The choice to abstain may reflect ambivalence, mild disapproval, or even the fear of political repercussions. Secondly, citizens have the right not to vote. Compelling them to vote infringes upon their freedom of speech, as the right to speak includes the right to remain silent. Thirdly, compulsory voting may lead to uninformed or random voting. This susceptibility to sensational and misleading advertising might negatively affect campaigning techniques and undermine the democratic process. Lastly, not everyone has the capacity to vote, as evident from a poll showing a lack of basic knowledge about the constitution among Americans. For these reasons, we strongly argue against the imposition of compulsory voting."
"We support the institution of compulsory voting. We believe that it enhances representation, fosters political interest, and fulfills civic duty. Firstly, compulsory voting increases representation. Low turnout in midterm elections, as indicated in the report by Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr., signals a need for measures to boost participation for better representation. Secondly, compulsory voting could spark more interest in politics among the population, leading to a more politically educated citizenry. Lastly, we argue that people have an obligation to vote. As per the European Court of Human Rights' ruling, mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, and voters have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot. In consideration of these points, we advocate for compulsory voting as a means to promote democracy, political education, and civic responsibility."
"The opposition staunchly contests the legalization of cannabis. Firstly, we point to health concerns, citing a study from the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore which found that heavy cannabis consumption altered blood proteins, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Secondly, we draw attention to the risk of impaired judgment and increased likelihood of accidents. Historical observations, such as those by Anslinger, demonstrate that cannabis usage can result in violent behaviour and irrational actions. Our third objection stems from the addictive nature of cannabis. We refer to evidence from the National Institute on Drug Abuse that shows the chemical THC, found in cannabis, triggers a release of dopamine in the brain. This reaction can create a cycle of repeated usage leading to addiction. Fourth, we express concern about underage access to cannabis if it is legalized. Former UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, expressed his worries about sending the wrong message to young, vulnerable teenagers, thereby increasing the risk of them gaining access to the drug. Lastly, we argue that the legalization of cannabis could inadvertently bolster illegal activities. As seen in California, despite legalizing the drug, there have been numerous massive illegal cannabis busts. Therefore, we firmly believe that the legalization of cannabis presents more harm than benefit."
"The proposition passionately advocates for the legalization of cannabis. We first underline that legal substances like alcohol and tobacco are significantly more harmful than cannabis, citing the DAWN report which states that these substances are responsible for more than half a million deaths annually in the USA. Our second argument pertains to the economic benefits of legalizing cannabis. We refer to advocates who argue that removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act could save billions by reducing criminal justice system expenditures and could generate significant tax revenues. Third, we emphasize the potential health benefits of cannabis, noting that vaporizers used for cannabis consumption can deliver therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens. Fourth, we argue that regulation could be more effective with legalization. As shown by the British Crime Survey, the percentage of frequent users in the 16-24 age group fell significantly after the drug was downgraded to class C. Fifth, we contend that legalizing cannabis would decrease black market sales and trafficking, drawing from Law Enforcement Against Prohibition's argument that decriminalization would cut off financial gains earned by gangs. Lastly, we believe in individual autonomy, echoing philosopher John Stuart Mill's argument that individuals should have sovereignty over their own bodies and minds. In conclusion, the potential benefits of legalizing cannabis outweigh the perceived risks."
"We stand firm in our opposition to the legalization of prostitution. Firstly, we believe legalization could lead to an increase in sexually transmitted diseases. A study conducted in Athens reported that a considerable number of prostitutes were HIV positive. Secondly, we fear that legalization could escalate immoral behaviour like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking. Reports from the Netherlands have shown an influx of these activities following the legalization of sex work. Thirdly, we are deeply concerned about the potential increase in violence against women. Critics of prostitution legalization in Sweden warned about the increase in violence and risk for women, and their concerns were realized after legalization. Lastly, we argue that selling one's body is inherently immoral, as prostitution places women in subordinate positions, reducing them to mere instruments for others' sexual pleasure. In conclusion, the harmful societal and personal consequences of legalizing prostitution far outweigh any potential benefits."
"In support of the legalization of prostitution, we present the following compelling arguments: Firstly, we contend that legalizing sex work bolsters the economy. This is seen through the history of Seattle, where one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, asserted that well-regulated prostitution could functionally support the economy. Secondly, we argue that legalizing sex work increases the benefits for sex workers, like health care, safe sex, and unionization. Advocates of decriminalization insist that sex workers, like all individuals, deserve rights to safety, health, and human rights, and outdated criminal laws must be revised to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers. Our third argument emphasizes that legalizing sex work would allow for regulation and safer working conditions. For instance, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has suggested legalizing prostitution to acknowledge the existing illegal practices and provide safer, regulated, and revenue-generating sex. Fourth, we claim that legalizing sex work would make the profession safer for women. As seen in the Netherlands, tolerating formally illegal activities like prostitution for harm reduction has been successful in ensuring women's safety. Lastly, we affirm that sex work is a valid choice over one's body, supported by a 2009 study that found the normalization of sex work among the workers surveyed. In conclusion, we believe that legalizing prostitution would yield numerous benefits for individuals involved and society at large."
"We firmly oppose the legalization of sex selection due to the following reasons: Firstly, we warn that sex selection can lead to a gender imbalance, a concern substantiated by Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. He highlights the problematic gender ratios in countries like India and China due to sex selection practices. Secondly, we assert that sex selection reinforces gender stereotypes and biases. As seen in China, son preference persists in strictly traditional families and rural areas, particularly under the one-child policy. Our third argument is that sex selection can lead to abortions or infanticide. The enforcement of the one-child policy in China, coupled with the preference for sons, has resulted in the neglect of girls and, in some cases, female infanticide. Conclusively, the societal and ethical implications of legalizing sex selection pose risks that outweigh potential benefits."
"We firmly advocate for the legalization of sex selection, presenting the following arguments: Firstly, we believe it falls within the rights of parents to select the sex of their child. Every individual harbors a slight preference when it comes to their baby's gender, and gender selection allows them to fulfill this desire. Secondly, we claim that sex selection enables better family planning. This is particularly applicable in countries like China, where the number of children per family is restricted, and gender selection can ensure the continuation of the family name. Our third argument is that sex selection can contribute to family happiness and completeness. As seen through adoption processes, families with a gender preference can legally select offspring of a specific sex, contributing to a sense of familial completeness. Fourth, we argue that sex selection can prevent certain diseases in children. For instance, gender selection can prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases by allowing the selection of a female embryo. Lastly, we contend that sex selection can prevent abortions and infanticide. As seen at HRC Fertility, reproductive medicine gives intended parents the ability to choose their children's sex, preventing potential gender-based abortions or infanticide."
"Opponents of prohibition argue, first and foremost, that flag burning is an effective tool of protest. To illustrate, they refer to an incident in 1984, when Gregory Lee Johnson set fire to an American flag during a protest against the Reagan administration. Despite being arrested and fined, the court ruled 5-4 in his favor, with Justice Brennan asserting that actions relating to the flag, such as saluting and displaying, are considered forms of expression, hence burning it must also be recognized as such. Secondly, they claim flag burning is justified under the freedom of expression. As further evidence, they cite Justice William Brennan's assertion in his majority opinion that defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution."
"Supporters of the prohibition believe that flags are important symbols that must be respected. They point to the opinions of justices like Warren who considered laws against flag-burning to be constitutional. Further, they argue that flag burning is an inflammatory act, an offensive gesture that should be outlawed. They insist that to allow such an act would be to condone disrespect and provocation, potentially leading to societal discord."
"The opponents of this topic present several claims arguing against the prohibition of women in combat roles. First, There should be equality between men and women. They point to the principle of equal pay for equal work which has been ingrained in the European Treaties since 1957. Legislation is already in place in the EU to combat discrimination, including that based on sex, and supports positive action to empower women (Article 157 TFEU, Article 19 TFEU). Second, Women are an asset in combat. They cite historical examples from the Revolutionary War to the present, where women have demonstrated their value in combat, despite societal beliefs. Third, Women bring unique skills/strategies to the battlefield. Evidence shows that some women have demonstrated better leadership and innovative problem-solving abilities than some men, which enhances the overall combat unit. Fourth,Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat. An example is the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death in 1917, where they lead a successful offense against German trenches, demonstrating their combat efficacy. Fifth, Women should have the choice to serve in combat roles. They provide examples where women have already proven their capabilities in combat situations, and thus, should be officially credited and allowed to serve. Finally, Women should be accepted in combat roles as long as they pass the necessary tests. They reference the new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which are gender-free."
"The proponents for the prohibition of women in combat roles present the following arguments: First, Men are better suited to combat roles than women. They claim that biological differences in strength and fitness levels make men more capable in combat situations. Second, Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers. Evidence suggests that physical differences between men and women may hinder women's combat effectiveness. Third, Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. They argue that the presence of women on the front lines may distract men due to protective instincts. Fourth, Women should serve in safer roles. They cite data from the IDF indicating that women are more concentrated in combat-support roles. Finally, The capture of female soldiers is a concern. They believe that women may have less mental resilience and emotional control in tough situations, which could potentially compromise the performance of the military unit."
"While the free press is the bedrock of a democracy, subsidizing journalism comes with the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. Political endorsements, we've seen, can create perceived conflicts of interest, skewing the neutrality of reporting. Moreover, in our nation's early founding, we had one communication medium, newspapers. Today, we have an array of print, broadcast, and digital platforms. Federal subsidies could inadvertently decide winners and losers, shielding inefficient companies and presenting huge obstacles for burgeoning entrepreneurs. Finally, like any business, if journalism cannot sustain itself, it should fail. Just take a look at our recent past - the federal government bailed out banks and automobile manufacturers, straining the taxpayer's back. Can we really afford to add media companies to that list?"
"The proposition argues that journalism, in today's world, is more than just a business. It is a crucial element of our democratic process. In this digital era, anyone can become a news distributor, making it difficult to sift through the massive amount of information online. A subsidy can provide a lifeline to professional journalistic entities amidst this competition. Furthermore, our history shows us the power of journalism in maintaining accountability and spreading information. Remember the Associated Press's factual reporting that quenched the public's thirst for news? Subsidizing journalism could potentially enhance the quality of reporting as well. Look at the IFJ's Ethical Journalism Initiative, a global campaign to defend standards in journalism. Moreover, subsidies can increase objectivity in reporting. For instance, consider 'Peace Journalism,' which presents local perspectives that often contradict the mainstream narrative. Such a nuanced approach can be supported with subsidies, giving voice to the unheard."
"We stand before you to argue against subsidizing space exploration. Private sector entities like SpaceX have shown us that commercial ventures can be successful. SpaceX not only delivers cargo and supplies to the ISS but also shuttles astronauts back and forth. Why then, do we need public funds? Moreover, space exploration is an expensive endeavour. With our current reliance on chemical propulsion, the costs of launching payloads into space are staggering. Do we want to pour public funds into something with such high overheads? Further, many space missions, including the shuttle and space station, have offered little scientific value. Lastly, we argue that there are more pressing issues to address right now, such as poverty. Thousands of children die each day due to poverty. Shouldn't we prioritize alleviating this suffering over exploring distant celestial bodies?"
"Proponents of subsidizing space exploration present compelling reasons for their stance. They argue that space exploration can lead to the colonization of other planets, expanding the ecological niche for our species, and even supplying clean energy. They contend that such exploration is financially beneficial, with the global space industry projected to generate more than $1 trillion by 2040, up from $350 billion at present. Furthermore, space exploration plays a crucial role in advancing science and technology, as it has enabled on-site geological investigations and numerous experiments aboard spacecraft. Supporters also believe that it is essential for humanity's survival, with future outposts on the moon and Mars potentially teaching us how to create sustainable, resource-recycling habitats. Lastly, they maintain that exploration allows us to unravel valuable information about the universe, contributing to our collective knowledge about the solar system."
"Opponents of subsidizing vocational education argue that it diverts money from other important programs, such as early childhood, K-12, and higher education, as evidenced by a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020. They point out that subsidizing such education can be expensive due to the necessary investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty. They also argue that such subsidies can lead to an influx of students in vocational fields, thereby decreasing enrollment in academic programs. Lastly, they claim that vocational education may not be a good career choice since it often offers limited transferability of skills, making it difficult for workers to transition to new careers or industries when job opportunities change."
"Proponents of subsidizing vocational education believe that it promotes workforce development, especially for individuals who face barriers to employment. They argue that vocational education provides a more direct path to employment by meeting current workforce needs and providing relevant training and education. They posit that vocational education is a good career choice, as there is high demand for skilled workers in fields such as healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing. Lastly, they believe that vocational education benefits society by addressing workforce shortages in specific fields, thereby filling in-demand jobs."
