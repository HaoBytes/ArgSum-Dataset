In the debate about whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offence, the opponents argue that it gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it, reduces suffering, grants the freedom to choose to end one's life, and provides benefits to the terminally ill. They draw upon evidence that suggests that many Britons travel to Switzerland to end their life due to a lack of legal protection in the UK, and that allowing such a choice in the eyes of the law would provide safeguards for those who wish to take it. They also claim that physician-assisted suicide is ethically and legally allowed in certain places, and that death can be a preferable alternative to terminal sedation."
"
The debate topic is 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'. The positive supporters of this statement claim that it should be a criminal offence as it violates the doctor's role, people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others and people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. Supporting the first claim, Dr. Lynda Young, MD stated her opposition as she believes it is incompatible with the role of the physician as a healer. Furthermore, The State of New York has also enacted a prohibition to criminalise this act. The second claim is supported by The New Zealand Medical Association which is against voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide, as it is unethical. Any person found assisting suicide can be convicted of this offence. Lastly, for the third claim, Emanuel argued that the Netherlands studies have failed to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to non-voluntary euthanasia of the vulnerable. Additionally, the slippery slope argument states that the acceptance of these practices can lead to the acceptance of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable.  Therefore, assisted suicide should be considered a criminal offence."
"
The debate topic is 'Homeschooling should be banned'. The stance taken is that homeschooling should not be banned, as it is often the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional, religious, ill, and disabled students. Furthermore, homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs, and this personalization can help students who are unhappy at mainstream school, as well as athletes and actors. It is also a way of protecting children from violence, drugs, alcohol, and psychological abuse. Finally, homeschooling gives parents the right to choose the education of their children and is often a better learning environment than mainstream schools. Evidence cited includes a Gallup poll of American voters showing a significant change in attitude towards homeschooling over the last twenty years, research showing mainstream schools failing to meet the requirements of pupils with SEN, and studies which report that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers."
"
This debate is about whether homeschooling should be banned or not. Supporters of banning homeschooling argue that it cannot be properly regulated or standardized, thus leading to potential abuse cases, while also depriving children from important social and educational experiences. The main argument against homeschooling is that public school is a better option for developing social skills and ensuring quality education since teachers are more qualified and have access to resources that parents don’t. Additionally, parents may not have the qualifications, time, or energy to effectively homeschool their children."
"
The topic of debate is 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'. The stance taken is that it should not be mandatory, as it is argued that routine child vaccinations are dangerous and contradict basic rights. The first claim is that routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous. As evidence, Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced, after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction). Additionally, the CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, and a “small possibility” exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disorder in which the person’s immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system, in about one or two per million people vaccinated. The second claim is that mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights. As evidence, compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as in the European Convention on Human Rights. Additionally, the First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'. Therefore, it is argued that routine child vaccinations should not be mandatory, due to the potential dangers posed by the vaccinations, and due to the potential violations of basic rights."
"
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. Supporters of this position cite the effectiveness of vaccinations in reducing the spread of diseases and protecting the lives of children. For example, after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, studies showed a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those under two. Additionally, the measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths by 74%. Furthermore, herd immunity is necessary for preventing the spread of a disease, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunizations prevented 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths between 1994 and 2018. Vaccines have saved countless lives, and the risk of preventable diseases should not be allowed to resurface due to vaccine hesitancy."
"
The debate topic is: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government'. Proponents of this view argue that government regulation of social media can bring about greater consumer protection, privacy, and freedom of expression. In opposition, opponents of this stance cite claims such as ineffective enforcement of regulations, privacy harm, limitations on freedom of speech and expression, and possible abuses of power by the government. To support their arguments, evidence includes lack of enforcement of the European Union’s GDPR, a Pew Research Center survey that found 81% of the public feeling they have little control over their personal information, Reuters' report on Facebook's commitment to restrict Vietnamese content after their cybersecurity law, and examples of Russian entities using Facebook to influence public sentiment. Meanwhile, opponents of government intervention claim it can lead to disruptions, excess bureaucracy and inefficiency, and political abuses. Therefore, the debate on whether or not social media platforms should be regulated by the government is complex, as both sides have valid arguments and evidence to support their positions."
"
In summary, this debate centers around the topic of social media platforms being regulated by the government, with the affirmative side arguing that such regulation will protect the younger audiences, prevent the spread of fake news, be beneficial to society, help deal with negative content, and protect users from malicious activity. The affirmative side presented evidence such as statements by British MP Alex Lamb and Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of Safe To Net, along with an example of Russian interference in the US presidential election and the unauthorized access to social network accounts in 2011. This evidence strongly suggests that social media platforms should be regulated by the government."
"
Summarizing, the opponents of the topic 'The USA is a good country to live in' have argued that the US has unfair health and education policies, a problematic and divisive political system, a negative culture, high taxation and cost of living, inequality and poverty, and is unsafe and xenophobic/racist. This is supported by evidence such as 8.1 million children under 18 years old were uninsured in 2007, 69% of people in households with annual incomes under $40,000 find it difficult to afford their health care costs, the US has an encompassing and profound polarization, living in the US is as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, almost half of Americans feel threatened by the cost of living, the US has a high Gini coefficient, 2.5 percent of wealth is owned by the bottom 50 percent, 11 percent of people view the US as safe, and middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites due to racialized trauma."
"
In summary, The USA is a good country to live in, as evidenced by its robust economy and high standard of living, world-renowned health and education systems, diverse wildlife, bill of rights and democratic freedoms, unique and influential culture, powerful global influence, and abundant job opportunities. According to Investopedia, America controls the top spot in the ranking of Gross Domestic Product, constituting less than 5 percent of the world's population, Americans generate and earn more than 20 percent of the world's total income. It is also noted that the advanced medical milieu has led to the world’s best cancer survival rates, a life expectancy for those over 80 that is actually greater than anywhere else, and lower mortality rates for heart attacks and strokes than in comparable countries. America also has 400 areas which are protected and maintained by the National Park Service, and many other parks in each state, with diverse wildlife and breathtaking landscapes. The US has been ranked the world's most powerful country for the seventh time, and job growth has been surging in recent months. Lastly, the USA offers individuals great job opportunities with almost all of the biggest companies in the world having offices in the country."
"
The debate on whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned has sparked intense discussions due to its far-reaching implications. Those who oppose it point out that it allows priests to focus on God and enables them to remain close to Christ with an undivided heart while dedicating themselves to God and their neighbors. It is also argued that celibacy is a strong religious belief as it has been almost universally accepted since the secular clergy was recruited from among married men. Furthermore, the practice helps to cultivate the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world and makes priests to be perceived as holy. Those who support abandoning the vow point out that it is a matter of choice for priests and can lead to sexually reckless acts. To this end, a report in Australia suggested that obligatory celibacy may have contributed to abuse in some circumstances and the Archbishop of Vienna suggested that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of sex abuse scandals. Nevertheless, many people still believe that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, as it has been an obligation to observe perpetual continence since the coming of Christ."
"
The topic of the debate is ""The vow of celibacy should be abandoned"". The proponents of this stance argue that celibacy is outdated, too pressuring and difficult, unhealthy and unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behavior and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. To support these claims, evidence has been cited such as Lakeland's belief that celibacy should become optional and Egan's interview in which he stated that celibacy could be open to discussion. Elizabeth Abbott further points out that celibacy has failed in the past and leads to warped people, and Jimmy O'Brien points out that sexual chemistry makes it a difficult lifestyle. Moreover, it is argued that celibacy is unnatural in nature as all living organisms are meant to reproduce, and Ford argues that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced. Additionally, it is argued that celibacy is one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church, as Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests and Breitenbeck expressed his support for ending celibacy in order to address the priest shortage. From these claims and evidence, it is clear that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned."
"
Summary:
The debate topic is whether we should abandon marriage. Those opposing the abandonment of marriage argue that it is beneficial for children, important for people, emotionally satisfying, brings couples closer, and provides financial benefits. Evidence provided for these claims includes the fact that children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused, have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager, and that marriage positively impacts children and society. It is also argued that marriage is important for religious and traditional reasons, provides an example of unconditional love, makes people happier, and provides financial benefits."
"
In today's debate, we will discuss the pros and cons of the topic: 'We should abandon marriage'. Proponents of abandoning marriage argue that marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women, that marriages are unstable, tie up people with unfair obligations and that most of the advantages of marriage can be achieved by a monogamous relationship. Evidence to support this includes a growing body of evidence that shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men, an increase in divorce rates globally since the 1970s, and the treatment of wives in terms of marital laws and in marriage ceremonies. Moreover, advantages of a monogamous relationship such as fostering emotional intimacy and reducing the risk of STDs are also put forth."
"
In the debate about whether or not we should abandon the use of school uniform, the opponents of the motion have presented several arguments. Their first argument is that children can still express themselves using other means and as evidence, they provided the fact that fashion is not considered to be the free speech that the United States Constitution guarantees and a research by Andrea Dashiell which showed that 54% of eighth graders still felt they could express themselves despite the policy of school uniforms. Their second argument is that school uniform reduces bullying and this is supported by a research from the Schoolwear Association which showed that 83% of teachers believed school uniforms can prevent bullying, as well as the fact that poorer families who are not able to afford the latest clothing trends may become targets of bullies.

The third argument is that school uniforms create a sense of unity and equality and the evidence given is the definition of uniforms by Joseph and Alex, which states that uniforms are costumes that identify members of a group and the Texas survey which found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community” than those who wore standard dress. The fourth argument is that school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning and the evidence provided is the fact that uniforms take the focus away from their attire and peers’ opinions, helping them concentrate better on their classwork and a belief that uniforms make the classroom a more serious environment. The fifth argument is that school uniforms save costs and the evidence used is a national survey which found that 94% of those surveyed believe school uniforms are cost-effective and a UK study which found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05, compared to £113.00 for regular clothing."
"
The topic of this debate is 'We should abandon the use of school uniform.' The supporters of this motion argue that school uniform is harming learning and creativity, stifling self-expression, excessively expensive, often uncomfortable or even sexist and is increasing conformity and harming individuality. To support their claims, evidence was cited from Senior Alyse Madsen, Ph.D. Tara Maginnis, Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, NBC News’ Today show, the First Amendment, research from the Children's Society, a GLSEN study, Laura Bates, and the Everyday Sexism Project.

In summary, it is argued that school uniforms should be abandoned due to its negative impacts. School uniforms restrict learning and creativity, constrain students' self-expression, are often unaffordable, uncomfortable or even sexist, and increase conformity instead of fostering individualism. This is evidenced by Senior Alyse Madsen, Ph.D. Tara Maginnis, Robyn Silverman, NBC News’ Today show, the First Amendment, the Children's Society, GLSEN study, Laura Bates, and the Everyday Sexism Project."
"
In the debate over whether or not we should abolish capital punishment, opponents of the death penalty argue that it provides closure for the victims and their families, is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, and serves as a deterrent to prevent other would-be criminals from committing similar offenses. They cite evidence such as statements from Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), and Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, as well as studies from Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, of Emory University, and Charles Stimson, JD, of the Heritage Foundation. All of this evidence clearly demonstrates that capital punishment serves a valuable purpose in protecting society by deterring crime and providing justice and closure to victims’ families."
"
Summarizing the debate material: The debate topic is 'We should abolish capital punishment'. Its supporters are claiming that state-sanctioned killing is wrong because the death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner, innocent people are too often sentenced to death, and it disproportionately harms the disenfranchised. Furthermore, it is irreversible, expensive and not an effective deterrent. Evidence was provided that in states without the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates and studies have shown that it is not an effective deterrent."
"
The opponents of the debate topic 'We should abolish intellectual property rights' argue that intellectual property rights incentivize creativity and innovation, incentivize investment in developing new products, protect against stealing and provide people or businesses with the right to be compensated for their efforts. Evidence provided includes theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivising the creation of new creative works, research showing a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and economic growth, copyright protecting intellectual property such as movies, music and television shows, and exclusive rights allowing owners of intellectual property to benefit financially from their creation. Thus, it is argued that intellectual property rights are necessary for providing economic incentive and protecting intellectual property from theft."
"
Summary:
The debate topic is 'We should abolish intellectual property rights', and it is argued that these rights prevent the continuous improvement of a service/product, restrict access to important information/products, are unfair, harm creativity/innovation, waste money, and are ineffective. Evidence supporting these claims include that some critics of intellectual property point to it as a harm to the public interest; Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman argues that intellectual property should be rejected; Lateef Mtima expresses concern that users of copyrighted content could potentially be held criminally liable; the General Assembly recognized the urgent need to respect indigenous peoples' inherent rights; Roderick T. Long holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of freedom of speech and freedom of the press; Petra Moser has suggested that patent policies may discourage innovation; innovators are able to create freely in a free culture; getting protection for a product is expensive; monopoly creates social costs; Tucker did not believe in intellectual property rights; and the Electronic Frontier Foundation has noted that criminal law is poorly suited for regulation of intellectual property law."
"
In the debate on 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', the opponents argue that gun control is ineffective (Evidence 1: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates), gun ownership is a right (Evidence 1: For today’s gun owners, the right to own guns nearly rivals other rights laid out in the U.S. Constitution in terms of its personal salience. About three-quarters of gun owners (74%) say this right is essential to their own sense of freedom), gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting (Evidence 1: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges) and gun ownership promotes self protection (Evidence 1: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question). Opponents of the idea of abolishing the right to keep and bear arms present the argument that gun control laws are not effective at reducing death rates, that the right to own guns is a constitutionally-protected right, that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports-shooting activities, and that gun ownership promotes self-protection."
"
In this debate, the topic is 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', and the argument is in favor of this stance. Supporters of this stance argue that banning guns would save lives, gun ownership leads to mass shootings and gun violence, guns can fall into the wrong hands, and guns lead to accidental deaths. Evidence supporting this includes that when Missouri repealed its permit law, gun-related killings increased by 25 percent, gun shops and dealers opening for business leads to an increase in killings, states with more guns have nine times more unintentional firearm injuries, and victims of unintentional shootings are three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm. All of this evidence suggests that abolishing the right to keep and bear arms could reduce the amount of deaths due to guns."
"
Summary:
The opponents of the adoption of an austerity regime make five claims, with evidence to support them. Claim 1 is that austerity cuts access to essential services, and this is evidenced by a study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that showed “unprotected” areas facing an average annual cut of 0.4% per year, as well as lack of youth outreach services preventing children from becoming “at risk”. Claim 2 is that austerity extends recessions, as indicated by financial press and economists citing austerity policies as an explanation for slow recovery in European countries and potential for deeper and longer recessions. Claim 3 is that austerity is unfair to citizens, with IMF-required austerity being significantly associated with rising inequality and poverty levels. Claim 4 is that austerity results in lower growth, with the OECD average slowing from 5 to 2.5%, and pay growth halving across OECD countries in the post-crisis years compared to the pre-crisis years. Finally, claim 5 is that austerity results in lower job creation, evidenced by Alessandro Turrini’s finding that countries with stronger employment protection legislation are seeing more unemployment due to austerity, as well as World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation indicating higher unemployment and vulnerable employment positions for women due to austerity."
"
In the debate over whether or not to adopt an austerity regime, those who are in favor of it make the case that it is important to reduce budget deficits, improve economic measures, and increase stability and is necessary in economically troubled times. Evidence from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina has demonstrated the benefits of 'expansionary austerity': fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'. Additionally, research from Arellano (2008) model simulations shows that cutting government consumption may raise the default premium in the short run. Austerity also improves the long-term economic performance of the economy by reducing wages and public expenditure, which helps to improve the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitate an export-led recovery. One example of successful austerity was in the United States between 1920 and 1921, in which President Warren G. Harding responded to an economic recession by cutting the federal budget by almost 50% and reducing tax rates. Lastly, austerity can help to reduce budget deficits and pay debts. The UK Chancellor, George Osborne, is aiming to achieve a budget surplus and rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade and the UK Office for Budget Responsibility predicted a surplus by the end of the decade."
"
The debate topic is ""We should adopt atheism"". Proponents of this stance argue that atheism is a valid philosophical belief and should be respected, while opponents claim that it discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion, and that people should be allowed to choose for themselves. In support of the opponents' argument, Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated that the State must support atheistic propaganda and imposed prison sentences for religious propaganda, and the Russian dictatorship has denounced religion and God as 'lies'. To counter this, freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs should be subject to reasonable limitations prescribed by law, as stated in international law. Moreover, it has been argued that whether one adopts atheism or not is ultimately a matter of choice with no scientific proof either way."
"
In summary, The debate is about the proposition 'We should adopt atheism'. Its positive supporters argue that atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it; that we cannot prove that God exists and hence, atheism should be adopted; religions are immoral and people should not follow them; and science can adequately explain the Universe. They point out that every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to confusion, while atheism allows for free thinking and privacy. In addition, Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. On the other hand, J.L. Schellenberg has developed an argument based on considerations that suggests that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world. Regarding the immorality of some religions, examples such as the Bible teaching how to treat slaves and Christianity setting unrealistic expectations and promoting violence are provided. Furthermore, Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is hostile to faith and argued that “anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done”. Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist."
"
In the given debate, the topic is 'We should adopt libertarianism'. Supporters of this argument claim that libertarianism promotes individual freedom and the efficient use of resources, while opponents contend that it is harmful to economic growth, minorities/those who are worse off, unjust/non-equal, and removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services. They cite evidence such as right-libertarians ignoring market failures, leading to monopolies and stifled innovation; Adam Smith's system of liberty being a network of restraints imposed by the government; the morality of requiring the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the poor's basic needs; the existence of market failures requiring government intervention to address; the failure of trickle-down theory to reduce income inequality; the lack of market-based solutions to address environmental problems; and the need for government protection of basic human rights. Overall, this debate brings up a number of concerns about the practical and moral implications of adopting libertarianism."
"
This debate is about whether we should adopt libertarianism or not. Proponents of libertarianism believe that it increases economic growth, increases freedom in the political system, increases happiness/fulfillment, and increases individual freedom/liberties. They point to evidence such as reduced taxation leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity, as advocated by Americans for Limited Government. Moreover, the protection of property rights, as argued by economist James Buchanan, is essential for ensuring individual freedom, as well as the protection of individual liberty which is the central goal of political systems, as argued by philosopher Robert Nozick. Furthermore, libertarians believe that allowing individuals to freely associate with others can promote greater cooperation and understanding, as argued by sociologist Robert Putnam, and that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests, as argued by philosopher Ayn Rand. Finally, they believe that self-ownership, as proposed by Murray Rothbard, is both axiomatic and universal and that they support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters."
"
The debate topic is: 'We should ban human cloning'. The stance of those who oppose this is that human cloning has a variety of positive applications in medicine, health, and research that would be forfeited by such a ban. This is evidenced by a variety of scientific studies, including studies from the Journal of the American Medical Association, National Institutes of Health, New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of Medical Ethics, Fertility and Sterility, Aging Cell, Journal of Evolutionary Biology, and Nature Biotechnology. These studies have shown that cloning can be used to replicate organs, advance medical research, reduce the use of animal testing, create a child who is free of genetic diseases, help couples struggling with infertility, study the genetic basis of infertility and aging, and produce genetically modified organisms for a range of applications. Therefore, those who oppose the ban on human cloning argue that it has a variety of positive applications and should not be banned."
"
The debate topic is 'We should ban human cloning'. This proposition is supported by four claims, with evidence to back them up. Claim 1 argues that cloning is not understood enough and references Kass' writings on how it can lead to a society that is willing to ""rationalize away the abominable"" and treats children as mere projects of the will. Claim 2 argues that cloning is unethical and anti-religious, citing the Holy See's opposition to human cloning, as well as Hwang's criticism of the process. Claim 3 states that cloning is unnatural and references Richard McCormick's argument that it disrupts the familial order. Finally, Claim 4 argues that cloning is unsafe, pointing to a Council of Europe report which recommends measures to ensure it is used only for medical purposes, as well as a study published in Nature Reviews Genetics which reported a low success rate for cloning animals. For these reasons, we should ban human cloning."
"
The debate topic is: 'We should ban private military companies'. Opponents of this stance claim that private military companies are financially beneficial, well-trained/better equipped, can supplement regular armies in specific tasks, and increase safety. These claims are supported by various studies and reports from organizations such as the Heritage Foundation, the RAND Corporation, the Senate Armed Services Committee, and the Congressional Research Service. The evidence suggests that private military companies offer greater flexibility in terms of hiring and deploying personnel, providing specialized training programs, and carrying out sensitive missions. Furthermore, private military companies can offload non-core tasks from regular army personnel, improve overall safety by providing support services, and invest in advanced technology to carry out operations with greater safety and effectiveness."
"
The argument that private military companies should be banned is based on evidence that they are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes, are not professional, cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country, prioritize profit over other considerations, and solicit engaging, or prolonging, conflict. Numerous reports and studies by the Congressional Research Service, Amnesty International, the Journal of Business Ethics, Human Rights Watch, the International Peace Institute, and the Project on Government Oversight have provided evidence of this, such as unlawful killings of civilians, conflicts of interest when serving clients, poor training and a lack of transparency, actions that are not in the best interest of the hiring country, and actions that prolong and escalate conflicts."
"
In summary, the opponents of the motion to ban the use of child actors have argued that acting may be the child's dream, that child performers are necessary for roles, that child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision/regulation and that the parents should decide for their child. Evidence has been provided to support each of these claims, including reports from the American Psychological Association, Drama Teachers Association of America, Actors Equity Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations. Ultimately, the opponents of this motion have argued that the use of child actors should not be banned, but that it should be carefully regulated and supervised, with parents given the ultimate decision-making power."
"
The topic of this debate is 'We should ban the use of child actors'. Supporters of this stance argue that being a performer harms the child's education; that they are at risk of exploitation, losing their childhood, having a lot of pressure and tending to develop problems later in life. A study published in the Journal of Adolescence in 2018 found that child performers may experience long-term negative effects on their personal, professional, and academic lives, leading to difficulties in adulthood. Additionally, reports by the American Psychological Association in 2017 and the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2016 have found that child performers may experience high levels of stress and pressure, leading to negative outcomes for their physical and mental health, and may also be at risk of physical harm due to long hours and intense work environments. Furthermore, a study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014 found that child performers may experience a loss of innocence and childhood due to the exposure to adult themes and mature material in the entertainment industry, and may also be at risk of human trafficking due to their vulnerability and lack of oversight. Herbert's case is an example of the negative effects of being a child actor; he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the studio walls. He ultimately developed an addiction to heroin, faced memories of past sexual abuse, and faced the impending death of his grandmother. All this evidence makes it clear that banning the use of child actors would be beneficial for the physical, mental, and educational health of these vulnerable children."
"
Summary: 
The opponents of closing the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility argue that it is essential to national security, provides better conditions for prisoners than alternatives, and is the single greatest repository of intelligence for the War on Terror. As evidence, it has been reported that 17.5% of detainees released have since been re-engaged in terrorist activities, with high-value enemy combatants possessing knowledge of an imminent threat, direct involvement in planning terrorist action, and if released, would constitute a clear and continuing threat. Furthermore, Guantanamo Bay is a secure location away from population centers, compliant with the Geneva Convention, provides humane treatment and exceeds any maximum-security prison in the world. Lastly, intelligence was obtained from enhanced interrogation techniques of detainees at the facility which helped lead to the capture of Osama bin Laden."
"
In conclusion, it is clear that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed. It has become a symbol of discrimination and injustice, is extremely costly to maintain, and is used to commit human rights abuses. Detainees have the right to trial in US courts, and its continued operation has harmed the US's image and reputation. All evidence points to the fact that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp must be closed to restore the rule of law and ensure justice for all."
"
In this debate, we are discussing the topic of whether we should end affirmative action. Opponents of this notion make three claims; that affirmative action boosts diversity, that it is necessary to compensate for the past, and that it reduces discrimination. Evidence used to support these claims include the APALC brief submitted in the Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin case, which stated that Asian students benefit from a diverse student body; Roger Wilkins' view that Blacks face a 375-year history of slavery, discrimination, and a lack of upward mobility; and two court cases, Wesolowski v. Saskatoon Catholic Teachers and Johnson v. Transportation Agency, which both upheld affirmative action plans to address existing discrimination. It is clear that affirmative action can help to increase diversity and reduce discrimination, as well as to compensate for past injustices."
"
In summary, the debate presented the topic that we should end affirmative action. The supporters of this stance argued that it diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, not just, perpetuates prejudice and reduces quality. Evidence presented to support these claims include that affirmative action is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students, privileged African Americans gaining professional upward mobility, a 2010 Arizona ban on government-sponsored affirmative action, Harvard University capping the number of admissions for Asian American students, Hardin's last book arguing that affirmative action is a form of racism, the University of Texas data showing the mean SAT scores and mean high-school grade-point averages varied widely by race, and almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education."
"
The debate topic is 'We should end mandatory retirement'. The opponents of this stance argue that mandatory retirement ages create opportunities for other workers, citing evidence such as a 2019 study by the International Monetary Fund which showed that it can stimulate economic growth and a 2012 report by the International Labour Organization which found that it can help boost employment for young people."
"
In summary, we should end the mandatory retirement age as it decreases institutional knowledge, harms the economy, is not fair/discriminatory, reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire and should let everyone retire when they are ready. Evidence suggests that mandatory retirement ages can limit labor market flexibility, lead to an inefficient use of human capital, promote intergenerational inequity, decrease older workers' sense of purpose, lead to decreased social connections and increased feelings of loneliness, negatively impact quality of life, reduce the risk of poverty in old age, and support active aging."
"
Summary:
The topic under debate is whether or not we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Those against the abolition of nuclear weapons argue that they are essential for protection and deterrence. To back up this claim, they point to the success of the deterrence strategy, which has kept peace for nearly 70 years, and to the example of Ukraine, which is not protected by a nuclear umbrella and was therefore invaded, while countries with nuclear weapons remain safe from a major, frontal attack."
"
Summary:
The debate focuses on whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Supporters of the argument contend that nuclear weapons have the potential to fall into the wrong hands, citing as evidence Jonathan Herbach's observation that some nuclear materials have never been recovered and Ariel Conn's warning that no one can be trusted with nuclear weapons due to the potential of mental health issues. They also assert that nuclear weapons can provoke or escalate a disastrous military action, citing Anthony Aguirre's account of the Cuban Missile Crisis and David Stanley's experience of a potential ICBM launch due to a lost connection."

The debate topic is 'We should fight urbanization'. The opponents of this debate argue that cities offer more opportunities, urbanization benefits the economy, and urbanization benefits the environment. Evidence supporting these claims include Japan's economic development in the 20th century, where migration from rural areas to metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education has characterized urbanization; investments in Sihanoukville, which lead to migration from rural areas due to growing economic opportunities; economic growth due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, and greater readiness to adapt; new government policies which encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, and the development of small-scale rural industries; and green technologies and higher productivity in urban areas due to positive externalities and economies of scale. Therefore, urbanization has many benefits which far outweigh the disadvantages."
"
In this debate, the topic being discussed is 'We should fight urbanization'. Those in favour of this topic argue that restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically and socially, as evidenced by a protection of natural resources in India, and disinvestment and governmental neglect in Venezuela. Urbanization is also linked to an increase in crime, as observed in the industrialization period in towns and cities, and in Bopal and Ghuma in India. Furthermore, urbanization has caused environmental degradation in areas with coastal developments, and an increased load of metals and organic contaminants. Finally, urbanization has led to irregular neighbourhoods and inadequate housing, filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease, and a lack of access to educational facilities. Therefore, the evidence supports the stance that we should fight urbanization."
"
In the debate on the topic 'We should introduce compulsory voting', the opponents argue that abstaining from a vote is a reflection of preferences, citizens have a right not to vote, and compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner. Evidence to support these claims include Herbert Spencer noting that a person, regardless of whether they voted or abstained, consented to the rule of the winning candidate, Minchin stating that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of civil liberties, and research from political scientist, Haydon Manning, which suggests that compulsory voting often leads to the use of sensational and misleading advertising."
"
In this debate, we are discussing the issue of compulsory voting. Those in favour of introducing compulsory voting claim that it increases representation, encourages people to become more interested in politics and creates a sense of responsibility in citizens to exercise their right to vote. Evidence to support these claims includes the fact that compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters, not just those who choose to vote, and that it increases the legitimacy of elected representatives and the political education of the people. Additionally, in countries where voting is compulsory, it is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution that citizens must exercise, and it should be seen as an important right that should not be taken for granted."

In this debate, the topic under discussion is whether we should legalize cannabis or not. Those who are against it have argued that cannabis harms the body, increases lack-of-judgement/accidents, is a gateway-drug/addictive and can get to the hands of underage teenagers/children. To support their claims, evidence has been presented, such as a recent study by the British Lung Foundation which found that smoking three cannabis joints causes the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes. Dutch research has also indicated that an increase in THC content increases the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers. Additionally, researchers have analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and have found that the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health has shown that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades. Furthermore, there are studies that suggest that early cannabis smokers are five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs, and NIDA claims that repeated use of cannabis could lead to addiction. Lastly, it has been suggested that legalizing cannabis could lead to increased use amongst teenagers, as seen in Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s, leading to more than twice the rate of marijuana use among the state's teens than the national average. Based on the arguments and evidence presented, it is clear that the potential risks and harms associated with cannabis should be taken seriously and legalization should not be encouraged."
"
In the debate, supporters of legalizing cannabis argued that alcohol and tobacco, which are legal, are actually more harmful than cannabis, making it hypocritical not to legalize the latter. They also cited the financial benefits that would come with legalizing cannabis, such as the reduction in law enforcement costs and increased tax revenues. Additionally, they highlighted the positive aspects of cannabis, such as its medicinal benefits and safety. Finally, supporters argued that decriminalizing cannabis would reduce the criminal activity that comes with its current illegal status. The evidence presented to support their stance included studies that show the comparative harm of cannabis versus alcohol and tobacco, as well as studies indicating that decriminalizing cannabis would reduce crime and lead to increased health benefits."
"
In this debate, we are discussing the topic 'We should legalize prostitution'. Those who oppose this stance argue that legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, increase immoral behaviour such as pimping/organized crime/trafficking, and increase violence against women. Evidence from Kenya shows that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs and registering prostitutes does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes. Research from Maxwell (2000) and other researchers have found substantial evidence that prostitution is linked to drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes. Further, research conducted by Giobbe (1993) and a survey of female sex workers in England and Scotland revealed evidence of physical and sexual violence."
"
In this debate, it is proposed that prostitution should be legalized. Supporters of the proposal make five claims, each of which is backed up with evidence. The first claim is that legalizing sex work boosts the economy, and evidence supporting this claim is provided in the form of the historical fact that one of the founders of Seattle supported prostitution, as well as the seventeenth-century court ruling in Amsterdam to permit brothels. The second claim is that it increases sex workers' benefits, with evidence provided in the form of the 2003 Ministry of Justice public discussion on the topic and ethnographic research which suggested it would improve the situation of women. The third claim is that it will allow regulation of those in the profession, with evidence provided in the form of Oscar Goodman's statement that it would generate revenue and provide a safer sex environment, as well as a Dutch survey from the 1990s which indicated a majority in favor of legalization. The fourth claim is that it will make the profession safer for women, supported by Chinese CDC intervention projects in the 1990s and a 2010 book on New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation. The final claim is that sex work is a valid choice over one's body, supported by statements from a former prostitute and a study of subjective well-being of prostitutes."
"
In the debate over whether we should legalize sex selection, opponents of the legalization of the practice claim that it can lead to gender imbalance, reaffirm gender stereotypes and biases, and create abortions and infanticide. Evidence to support these claims include the fact that today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world due to son preference, including gender-biased sex selection; that in China and India, the ratio of girls to boys is on the decline due to sex selection; that it can be seen as an ethical and moral violation to break the law of nature by interfering with the gender of the unborn child; that repeat abortions are more likely when sex-selective abortions are conducted; and that two doctors were not prosecuted for performing an abortion for the purpose of sex selection in Britain."
"
Summary: In the debate on whether we should legalize sex selection, those in favor of the motion argued that it is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child, as it allows for better family planning, makes the family happier and complete, prevents diseases in the child, and will prevent abortions/infanticide. Proponents of the motion gave evidence such as selecting the gender of a baby in advance can be beneficial for family planning, gender selection gives parents effective control over the number of children they want, gender selection can be a very comforting option for parents who have lost a child, and reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer."
"
The debate topic is ""We should prohibit flag burning"". The opponents of this stance argue that flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique and is justified due to freedom of expression. In support of these claims, evidence such as Miller's attorney stating that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment and the 1984 court ruling 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson, which held that Johnson's protest was sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment, was used. Furthermore, Justice Brennan's opinion in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment, as well as the notion that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable was highlighted as supporting evidence."
"
The debate topic is whether or not we should prohibit flag burning. Supporters of the argument that flag burning should be prohibited believe that flags are important symbols that should be respected and that burning a flag is a very inflammatory act. Evidence to support the first claim includes the fact that women should be allowed to join the military and serve in combat units if they meet the same training standards as men, and that in Austria flag desecration is illegal under Â§248 Strafgesetzbuch. To support the second claim, evidence includes the ordinance in Hong Kong that states that burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling, or trampling a flag is considered flag desecration, and that those in favor of legislation to proscribe flag burning believe that it is a very offensive gesture."
"
The debate topic is ""We should prohibit women in combat"". The opponents argue that this should not be the case as there should be gender equality, women are an asset in combat, they can create unique skills and strategies, they can overcome differences and be just as capable as men, they should be able to serve in combat if they choose to, and women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests. Evidence to support this includes that in health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and female life expectancy is higher, that gender equality prevents violence against women and girls, that modern warfare is becoming increasingly high-tech which makes physical strength less important, women recruit being less likely to become disciplinary problems, female soldiers showing great skill and courage in past wars, new physical fitness standards being objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, and female soldiers failing to pass the fitness tests not being allowed to serve in combat roles. It is clear that prohibiting women from combat is not the correct approach."
"
In conclusion, the debate regarding whether women should be allowed in combat is a complex issue. Although there is evidence that women have the capacity to perform in the military, there are still several concerns that need to be addressed, such as physical differences, distractions, mental and emotional stress, and the risk of capture and abuse. Supporters of prohibiting women in combat argue that men are better suited to combat roles, as physical differences may still be a hindrance for women, and that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers, as well as being a distraction or harming the functioning of the military. Furthermore, it is argued that women should serve in safer roles, as there is a risk of capture and abuse if they are put in combat roles."
"
The debate topic is: 'We should subsidize journalism'. The argument against this is that government intervention has the risk of inserting bias/harming objectivity. To support this, it is argued that government funding would lead to government regulation, which can restrict freedom of the press. It is also argued that subsidizing journalism can lead to political endorsements and thus create a perceived conflict of interest. Therefore, subsidizing journalism could have negative implications for the objective reporting of news."
"
This debate revolves around the topic 'We should subsidize journalism', and the stance taken is in support of the motion. The first argument is that a subsidy is essential to ensure the financial viability of media markets, and evidence of this is provided by how the news media lost a considerable percentage of their advertising revenues during the pandemic. Additionally, investigative journalism is suffering due to lack of resources and funding, as evidenced by Soldatov's argument that WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by investigative journalism. The second argument is that journalism is essential for the dissemination of information and accountability, and the 2011 report from the Oxford School for the Study of Journalism and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism provides evidence of how mainstream media is the lifeblood of topical social media conversations. Lastly, MacLean argues that education in journalism empowers members of the public to understand how media work. To support the claim that subsidies will increase the quality of journalism, evidence from the European Union is provided on how it encourages competition between powerful incumbents and the new entrants. Furthermore, the IPD journalism program helps strengthen journalists' economic literacy. Thus, it can be concluded that subsidies for journalism should be implemented as it is essential for the financial viability of media markets, for disseminating information and for accountability, and it also increases the quality of journalism."
"
The debate on the topic, 'We should subsidize space exploration' has presented arguments both in favor and against the proposition. Proponents of space exploration argue that it can be achieved in partnership with the private sector, and that it has great potential for developing technology and inspiring innovation. Opponents, however, have raised objections that space exploration is expensive, ineffective and that there are more pressing issues that deserve to be funded. While both sides have presented evidence in support of their positions, ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide if they believe that space exploration is worth subsidizing."
"
In conclusion, Space exploration should be subsidized due to its potential to colonize the resources/lands of other planets, to improve science/technology, to be financially beneficial, to be necessary for the future survival of humanity, and to unravel information about the universe. Space exploration can help us colonize new lands, develop new technologies, increase economic growth, aid sustainability efforts, and gain a greater understanding of the universe. Evidence such as satellite broadband helping to drive down the cost of data and being capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions, can be used to support this claim."
"
In the debate over whether we should subsidize vocational education, opponents argue that doing so diverts money from more worthy causes, is expensive, and leads to an influx in those professions, making it not a good career choice. Evidence supports these claims, such as a 2019 report by the American Federation of Teachers which found that vocational education programs may not provide the skills and knowledge that workers need to succeed in the 21st century, and a 2020 study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research which found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be limited by the ability to scale. Furthermore, a study analyzed the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany and found that the subsidies led to an increase in enrollment in vocational programs and an increase in employment in the relevant fields. Additionally, a 2019 report by the American Federation of Teachers and a 2016 report by the Education Trust both found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement or adequate support for non-college bound students."
"
In the debate over whether or not we should subsidize vocational education, those in favor of this action argue that it promotes those with fewer resources, better fits many students, is a good career choice, and is beneficial for the entire market and society. In terms of promoting those with fewer resources, a study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education can increase economic mobility, particularly for individuals who may not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education or who face barriers to employment. Additionally, a report by the Center for American Progress in 2018 found that subsidizing vocational education can better align with local labor market needs, particularly in regions with high demand for skilled workers. In terms of better fitting many students, a report by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that vocational education programs often offer customized learning experiences tailored to the individual needs and interests of students, which can better fit the learning styles of many students compared to traditional academic programs. Furthermore, a report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that vocational education programs often have a career-focused curriculum, which can better fit the career goals and aspirations of many students compared to traditional academic programs. Regarding vocational education being a good career choice, a report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that individuals with vocational education often have shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education. A study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in 2020 also found that individuals with vocational education have higher earning potential compared to those without postsecondary education. Finally, in terms of being beneficial for the entire market and society, a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that vocational education programs can promote workforce diversity by providing training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by increasing the representation of diverse individuals in the workforce. Additionally, a report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that investments in vocational education can support local economies by providing training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by filling workforce shortages and contributing to overall economic development."
