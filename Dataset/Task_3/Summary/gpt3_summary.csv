Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
","
In the debate on whether assisted suicide should be criminalised, the opponents argue that it should not be criminalised as it gives dignity to the person who wishes to commit it, reduces suffering, gives people the freedom to choose to end their life and benefits the terminally ill. Supporters of this view cite the evidence that the idea of assisted suicide securing human dignity is a popular idea as reflected in the names of organizations and laws concerning this issue; that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if certain criteria are met; that it contrasts with active euthanasia; and that it benefits the terminally ill, with Pratchett being an example."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'. The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made..
- claim_3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text..
- claim_4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
","
In conclusion, assisted suicide should remain a criminal offence as it allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit, violates the doctor's role, is not an inherent right of individuals, and there is a risk of judgement impairment for people who are ill. The evidence provided demonstrates that physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, or worried about being a burden, as these can be signs of not every effort having been made. Additionally, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and a slippery slope argument was provided which supports the risk of non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia in the event of acceptance of assisted suicide."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The agency provides Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
","
In this debate, we are discussing the proposition of banning homeschooling. Opponents of the proposition argue that homeschooling should not be banned because it is often the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional, religious, ill or disabled students; homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace or needs; mainstream schools can be rife with violence and bullying; parents should be allowed to choose the education of their children; and finally, the home is a good learning environment. Evidence supporting these arguments include services offered by the Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools; the sense of autonomy which Gosling experienced; Holt's perspective that homeschooling isn't the answer to the badness of schools; homeschoolers' desire to have a deeper understanding of their children's education progress; and homeschoolers' desire to give their children a more active learning environment and a broader socialization."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
","
In the debate, the argument that homeschooling should be banned has been made. The arguments for this position are that homeschools cannot be regulated or standardized, missing out on the essential experiences to develop social skills, mainstream schools are of higher educational quality and parents are not qualified as teachers. In support of this claim, evidence was given in the form of Vyckie Garrison's story of having to switch her six children to public school after 18 years of homeschooling due to her depleted energy, the lack of work experience, sports, and other opportunities that homeschooled children miss out on, the National Education Association's opposition to homeschooling, and Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich's assessment of the one-sided point of view that homeschooling can give children."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'.
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Mayo Clinic states that natural infection 'often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.'.
","
This debate centers around the argument that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. Proponents of the argument point to the efficacy of such vaccinations, while opponents cite the possible dangers posed by the vaccine or side effects, along with potential conflicts with basic human rights. The opponents of mandatory vaccinations bring up the case of Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), which was pulled from the market after it was discovered that the vaccine might have caused higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction). They also reference the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' In addition, they cite a study from Mayo Clinic which states that natural infection 'often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.' Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to make child vaccinations mandatory is a complicated one that requires a careful examination of all the potential benefits and harms."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
","
This debate is on the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'. The positive supporters argue that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory, as they are effective, save lives, and are necessary to protect others from virus/disease spreading. Evidence for this stance includes: after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, a study found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those under two years of age; it is estimated that full vaccination of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections; in 2005, 66 cases of measles in the US were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who returned to a community with many unvaccinated children and this outbreak infected 34 people, three of which were hospitalized; smallpox killed an estimated 300-500 million people in the 20th century before it was eradicated in 1979; and finally, an estimated three million children die each year due to vaccine-preventable diseases. With this evidence, it is clear that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory in order to prevent unnecessary suffering, save lives, and protect the health of others."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
","
In this debate, we discuss the statement 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government'. Opponents of this statement put forward five claims - that social media regulation is not effective, that it harms privacy, harms freedom of speech and other democratic rights, that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, and that it can lead to political abuses by the government. To support their arguments, opponents cite examples such as the ineffectiveness of the G.D.P.R. legislation, the lack of control individuals have over their personal information, the restrictions placed on Vietnamese content by Facebook after the nation passed a cybersecurity law, the bureaucracy and inefficiency created when governments spend on public goods, and the use of dark advertisements to polarise voters and degrade democracy. In conclusion, opponents of the statement 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government' argue that it is not effective, harms privacy, harms freedom of speech, is an intervention in the affairs of a private company, and can lead to political abuses by the government."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
","
In this debate, it is argued that social media platforms should be regulated by the government. The supporters of this claim present five arguments that highlight the benefits of social media regulation. Firstly, regulation would protect the younger audiences, as it would introduce an independent, statutory regulator with the full support of the government to protect people online. Secondly, it can help to tackle the spread of fake news, as it would allow people to discern fact from fiction. Thirdly, social media regulation would make social media platforms more transparent by providing users and legislators insights into the algorithms that determine content visibility. Fourthly, it could help to deal with negative content, by outlawing manipulative techniques used to keep users engaged on the platforms. Finally, it would help to protect against malicious users, as it would reduce the likelihood of stolen information and forced shares. All in all, regulation of social media platforms is necessary in order to provide a safe and secure online environment."

    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..

This debate is about the question: Is the USA a good country to live in? The debate is between those who believe the USA is a good country to live in and those who do not believe it is a good country to live in. On one side, those who believe the USA is a good country to live in argue that the country has a lot of advantages that make it a good place to live. On the other side, those who do not believe the USA is a good country to live in argue that the country has many issues such as unfair health and education policies, a problematic/divisive political system, a negative culture, high taxation/costs of living, inequality/poverty, and safety concerns.

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
","
The debate topic is 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned'. The proponents of this stance argue that the current vow of celibacy should be abandoned. Opponents of this view put forward six claims: that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God; that it is a strong religious belief; that it makes priests to be perceived as holy; that priests choose to be celibates; that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained; and that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts. 

Evidence is provided to support each of these claims. For example, it is argued that by freeing himself from other obligations, a priest is freer to devote himself to God; that Sacerdotalis caelibatus is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI; that the Pope rejects the notion that marriage is the only reasonable path available to a person; and that Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. Additionally, it is argued that four individuals (Theresia, Sr. Agnes, Sr. Elisabeth and Sr. Klara) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty; and that the Archbishop of Vienna has suggested that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals. 

Overall, this debate centers around the pros and cons of the vow of celibacy and whether it should be abandoned. The opponents of this view make the case that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, is a strong religious belief, makes priests to be perceived as holy, is a choice made by priests, should be maintained in order to preserve religious experiences and traditions, and that abandoning it could lead to sexually reckless acts."
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
","
The debate topic is ‘The vow of celibacy should be abandoned’, with its supporters arguing that it is outdated, too pressuring, unhealthy and unnatural, and it leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Evidence supporting these arguments include the 1540 commutation of the vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity, the difficulty of sexual chemistry for priests, the natural requirement for organisms to reproduce, the 2004 case of sexual abuse in the US Catholic Church, and the priest shortage. Therefore, it is clear that abandoning the vow of celibacy is an important step in allowing for healthier relationships, safer environments, and more priests to serve in the Church."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
","
In this debate, we will be discussing whether we should abandon marriage. Those who oppose the idea of abandoning marriage argue that it has a variety of benefits. Firstly, it is beneficial for children as it provides them with gender specific support from having both a mother and a father. This is evidenced by research which suggests that mothers and fathers have particular roles to play in the development of boys and girls. Secondly, marriage is important for people, whether due to religious/traditional reasons, or the fact that it can be a great blessing when it produces a child or receives one through adoption. Thirdly, marriage is known to make people happier, as research suggests that married people are happier than people who are not married. Fourthly, marriage can make the couple closer as married adults are more satisfied and trusting of their partner than those who are cohabiting. Finally, marriage also provides important financial benefits, such as lower taxes and car and home insurance premiums. For these reasons, we should not abandon marriage."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
","
The topic of this debate is “We should abandon marriage.” The proponents of this stance posit that marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women, marriages are unstable, marriages tie up people with unfair obligations, and most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship. To support these claims, they cite evidence such as the expectation that women be submissive to male family members, an overall increase in divorce rates since the 1970s, Qatar’s laws requiring women to have male guardian permission to marry and the subsequent lack of rights when a woman is married, and that monogamy is such a dominant approach to love and partnership that it may seem like simply the way relationships work. Therefore, the proponents of the argument put forth that marriage should be abandoned due to the negative consequences it carries for many individuals."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..

Evidence supporting these claims includes an oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms” published on PennLive.com, that states uniforms do not stop students from being themselves and the Department of Education finding increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying. It is also argued that uniforms create a sense of unity in terms of community and boost school pride and spirit, and that students in uniform are more focused in their academics, leading to fewer disciplinary problems. Finally, it is argued that using uniforms as opposed to traditional back-to-school clothing can save families up to $1800 per child over a 12-year period."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","
In summary, the debate argues that we should abandon the use of school uniform due to its detrimental effects on student learning, self-expression, finances, comfort, and individualism. According to research, school uniforms are linked to poorer self-perception, a decrease in creativity, a financial burden, a limitation on comfort, and the discouragement of individualism. For example, Tara Maginnis Ph.D. argued that the use of school uniforms violates constitutional rights to free speech and expression. Additionally, a study at Arizona State University discovered that students without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception. Moreover, a GLSEN study showed that 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and 32 percent of transgender students were prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that getting to dress themselves encourages independent thinking and prepares them for adulthood. Therefore, it is important to abandon the use of school uniform to protect the rights of the students."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:

- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
","
The debate is on whether we should abolish capital punishment or not. Proponents of this position maintain that capital punishment is an inhumane and unacceptable form of punishment, while opponents argue that it helps the victims/their families, is acceptable in cases of severe crimes and it also prevents future crimes. 

Evidence in support of opponents includes a statement from Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina, in which he expressed his support for the bill that will bring back the death penalty in order to provide closure and justice for the victims' families. Further, the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has stated that the death penalty for juveniles is now contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. In addition, David Muhlhausen, a Research Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, argued that studies have demonstrated that capital punishment does, in fact, save lives. 

In conclusion, opponents of abolishing capital punishment contend that it provides justice for the victims and their families, is acceptable in cases of severe crimes and it also prevents future crimes. However, the debate is still ongoing."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
","
This debate centers around the topic of whether capital punishment should be abolished. Supporters of the affirmative stance hold that state-sanctioned killing is wrong, as it is applied unfairly and unjustly depending on race and wealth. They further argue that the death penalty disproportionately harms those who are disadvantaged, citing a study from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts which found that the median cost of a federal death penalty case is eight times more expensive than a non-death penalty case. Lastly, they point to the irreversibility of the death penalty, noting that no studies show that it is a deterrent to crime and that it does not prevent crime. With all this in mind, it is time for all nations to abolish capital punishment."

","
The topic of this debate is 'We should abolish intellectual property rights'. The stance for this debate is against the abolition of intellectual property rights, as there are numerous benefits that such rights provide. Firstly, Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) incentivize creativity and innovation by codifying intellectual property for plant breeders to encourage the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society, as stated by UPOV. Secondly, IPRs incentivize investment in developing new products by providing incentives to commercial organisations to produce them. Thirdly, IPRs protect against stealing by providing the necessary protections to ensure Americans' rights in intellectual property are protected. Lastly, IPRs allow people or businesses to own their innovations and be compensated for their endeavour, as IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either for free or with reasonable monetary compensation. In conclusion, IPRs provide numerous benefits that should not be overlooked and hence, should not be abolished."

","
In this debate, we will explore the argument that we should abolish intellectual property rights. Supporters of this stance contend that intellectual property prevents continuous improvement of a service or product, restricts access to important information or products, is unfair, harms creativity and innovation, wastes money, and is ineffective. Evidence for these claims includes the example of Fox Talbot, who by 1852, was accused of hampering the development of photography in England due to his insistence on economic rights to his intellectual property. Professor Lessig’s analysis of piracy and property in the intellectual property realm highlights how multinational corporations have captured the law-making process and only prioritize the accumulation of capital. Additionally, the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is viewed as iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries and poor patients. Furthermore, the cost of obtaining protection for the first time can be expensive and intellectual property is not actually scarce, being more of a legal fiction created by the state. Therefore, the evidence presented suggests that we should abolish intellectual property rights."

The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..

    - Evidence 1: Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,.
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","
This debate is about the proposal to adopt an austerity regime. Those against the proposal argue that austerity cuts access to essential services, exacerbates recessions, is unfair to citizens, lowers economic growth, and results in fewer job creations. Evidence for these claims includes reports from the UK National Audit Office, the Health Foundation, and UN rapporteur Philip Alston, as well as economic data from the EU and ECB. Taken together, the evidence suggests that an austerity regime would have a detrimental effect on citizens and the economy."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:

- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
","
This debate is about the topic of whether or not we should adopt an austerity regime. The pro-austerity stance argues that austerity can improve economic measures, be important in the long term, increase stability, reduce deficits or pay debts, and be necessary in economically troubled times. In support of these claims, evidence suggests that countries like Latvia and Estonia who pursue fiscal austerity have seen a rebound in economic growth, lower debt levels can encourage the private sector to invest, Morocco was a heavily indebted country but austerity measures helped to promote economic stability, a World Bank study found that a debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 77% can slow economic growth, and countries like the UK, Greece, and Spain have used austerity as a way to address budget concerns during the global economic downturn."

The debate topic is ""We should adopt atheism"". The stance taken in this debate is that atheism should not be adopted. The opponents argue that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion, lacks morality and ultimately, it should be left to individuals to choose for themselves whether atheism should be adopted or not. In support of this argument, the opponents cite evidence from John Locke, an advocate of tolerance, who urged authorities not to tolerate atheism due to its potential to lead to chaos. Additionally, Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, argues that atheists can behave morally, however, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life. Finally, Liddle states that there is no scientific proof for either option - either God or no God - and it should be a matter of individual choice. Therefore, this debate suggests that atheism should not be adopted."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
","
In summary, we should adopt atheism because it is beneficial to the person that adopts it and has no proof that God exists. Religions are immoral and science can adequately explain the Universe, thereby, demonstrating that morality does not come from obedience of a set of rules. Atheism provides us with a superior basis for ethics by allowing us to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves and make moral decisions based on how they affect others."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:

- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
","
The debate topic is 'We should adopt libertarianism.' Supporters of libertarianism argue that it is an effective way to promote individual autonomy and liberty, while opponents argue that it has serious negative consequences for economic growth, minorities, justice, and the government’s role in protecting citizens’ rights. Supporters of libertarianism claim that market-based solutions can be efficient and just, while opponents point to market failures that can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention. Supporters of libertarianism argue for legalization of what they see as “victimless crimes,” such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution, while opponents of libertarianism maintain that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens, such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. Evidence provided for each stance supports the claim. The 2007 Northern Rock failure and Robert Nozick’s concept of “enslavement contracts” were mentioned as evidence that libertarianism can have harmful economic and justice implications. Furthermore, Joseph Stiglitz’s view on market failures was mentioned to suggest that it can result in unequal outcomes, and a Human Rights Watch report was cited as evidence that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens."

- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.

    - Evidence 1: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
","
In summary, this debate seeks to prove that libertarianism should be adopted. Supporters of the argument suggest that libertarianism would increase economic growth, freedom in the political system, individual happiness and freedoms, and that there is evidence to back this up. Specifically, they cite the work of sustainability advocates Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins, a study by the Cato Institute, and psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, as well as the work of Sunstein and Thaler to support their claims."

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child..
","
In this debate, I argue that we should ban human cloning due to the potential risks associated with it. First, cloning is not understood enough yet, which is evidenced by Kass's argument that it should not be tolerated as it would lead to the abominable and converting procreation into manufacture. Second, cloning is considered unethical and anti-religious, as stated by Pope John Paul II. Third, it is unnatural, as mentioned by the Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist Rev. Demetri Demopulos. Finally, it is unsafe, which is supported by FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi's warning that it could transfer sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child. All these facts taken together point to a clear conclusion that human cloning should be banned."

","
This debate is about the proposition of banning the use of child actors. The affirmative side argues that being a performer harms the child's education, as evidenced by a 2013 study published in the Journal of Education and Practice which found that child performers often miss school or receive inadequate education, leading to a lack of basic skills and knowledge. Furthermore, child performers are at risk of exploitation, as a 2012 study published in the Journal of Adolescence found that they are often subject to labor violations such as wage theft, lack of breaks, and poor working conditions. The pressure of being a child actor can also lead to the loss of childhood, as evidenced by a 2016 report by UNICEF that found child actors are often exposed to unhealthy working conditions, leading to the loss of their childhood. Additionally, child actors may experience mental health issues due to the pressure and stress associated with their work, as shown by a 2014 study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence. Lastly, a lack of identity when they reach puberty and are no longer of commercial value may lead to difficulties adjusting to the real world, as demonstrated by Herbert's case. All of these points clearly suggest that the use of child actors should be banned."

But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
","
In summary, supporters of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp claim that detainees have the right to trial in US courts, supported by the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Boumediene v. Bush. It is also argued that the camp harms US image/reputation/institutions, is a symbol of discrimination/injustice, is expensive, personnel commit crimes against prisoners, and unjust treatment/tactics are used. This is evidenced by the camp serving as a recruiting tool for terrorists, its catastrophic failures, its high cost of maintenance, and the use of various harsh interrogation techniques, among others."
We should end affirmative action,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
","
This debate focuses on the topic of whether we should end affirmative action. The opponents of ending affirmative action put forth three claims and supporting evidence: (1) affirmative action boosts diversity, (2) it is necessary to compensate for the past, and (3) it reduces discrimination. For the first claim, opponents point to a study which found that students of color experienced a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect. For the second claim, opponents cite the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights definition of affirmative action as ""any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future."" Finally, opponents of ending affirmative action note that the Supreme Court upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories. Ultimately, opponents of ending affirmative action argue that affirmative action is necessary to reduce discrimination, boost diversity, and compensate for the past."
We should end affirmative action,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some opponents believe, among other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2010 Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107 [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action is not just.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..
- claim_4: Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Opponents,[REF] who sometimes say that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination', further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects in addition to failing to achieve its goals..
- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
","
This debate will discuss whether or not we should end affirmative action. Supporters of this stance argue that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Evidence to support this includes that some opponents believe it is counter-productive, as in 2010 Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107. Additionally, Asian-American students, who have top test scores, are marked down on “personality trait” testing and thus are not being given the chance to attend a prestigious university. Furthermore, opponents claim that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination' and that it has undesirable side-effects, as well as sweeping the systemic problems of economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children under the carpet. Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, also argued that these programs reduce quality. From this evidence, we can conclude that affirmative action should be ended."
We should end mandatory retirement,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end mandatory retirement', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: A mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the International Labour Organization in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people, as older workers are encouraged to leave the workforce and make room for younger workers..
- claim_2: mandatory retirement age benefits those that are about to be retired.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can increase financial security for workers, as they can receive pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a specified age..
","
The debate question is: Should we end mandatory retirement? Taking the stance that we should end mandatory retirement, the debate script will argue that a mandatory retirement age does not create new employment opportunities, and does not provide any financial benefits for those that are about to be retired. 

Argument 1: Mandatory retirement does not create new employment opportunities. The International Labour Organization’s 2012 report found that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people. However, this report does not take into consideration other factors that can contribute to the employment rate. It does not provide evidence that this effect is large or long-lasting, meaning that other policies are needed to truly make a difference in the rate of employment.

Argument 2: Mandatory retirement does not provide any financial benefits for those that are about to be retired. The Employee Benefit Research Institute’s 2010 report found that mandatory retirement ages can increase financial security for workers. However, this report does not take into account other sources of income or retirement savings. Furthermore, this report does not provide any evidence that the financial security that is created is long-lasting, or that it is worth the loss of income and potential job opportunities for those that are forced to retire early. 

In conclusion, it is clear that mandatory retirement does not create new employment opportunities or provide any financial benefits for those that are about to be retired. For these reasons, we should end mandatory retirement."
We should end mandatory retirement,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end mandatory retirement', Its positive supporters argue that:

- claim_3: A mandatory retirement is not fair/discriminatory.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can result in age discrimination, as older workers are forced to retire, regardless of their ability to continue working..
- claim_4: A mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Evidence from Social Security Eligibility by Jonathan Gruber and David Wise, published in The American Economic Review, found that health declines after mandatory retirement, suggesting reduced quality of life..
- claim_5: We should let everyone retire when they are ready.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging, as older workers can continue to contribute to the workforce, using their skills and experience to benefit society..
","
In summary, we should end mandatory retirement as it decreases institutional knowledge, harms the economy, is not fair or discriminatory, reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire and allows people to retire when they are ready. Evidence for these claims include that there is no mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers in the UK, a study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that mandatory retirement ages can impede workforce diversity, a report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can result in age discrimination, evidence from Social Security Eligibility by Jonathan Gruber and David Wise, published in The American Economic Review, found that health declines after mandatory retirement, and the same report found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
","    - Evidence 2: Nuclear weapons play a significant role in deterring conventional and chemical weapons attacks.

The topic of the debate is: “We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons”. The stance of the opponents is that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. In support of their stance, they have provided two evidence. Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years. Evidence 2: Nuclear weapons play a significant role in deterring conventional and chemical weapons attacks. 

To summarize, the opponents of the motion argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence and they have presented two pieces of evidence to support their stance. The first evidence shows that deterrence has been a successful tool for maintaining peace for almost 70 years. The second evidence states that nuclear weapons are effective in deterring conventional and chemical weapons attacks."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
","
Summary: The debate focuses on the topic 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons'. Supporters of the topic argue that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands and provoke or escalate disastrous military action. As evidence, recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Additionally, the Pentagon has estimated that if there was a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, there would have been 375 million deaths in Russia, China and other countries due to nuclear fallout and Russian short-range missiles. Therefore, the topic of abolition of nuclear weapons should be taken seriously in order to prevent further nuclear disaster."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:

    - Evidence 1: Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
","
The debate topic is ""We should fight urbanization"", and the opposition claims that urbanization offers more opportunities, benefits the economy, and benefits the environment. Evidence for the opposing stance suggests that migration to urban areas is usually motivated by a hope of better lives, that new government policies have encouraged urbanisation in China's rural population, and that urbanization drives innovation in green technologies. While the evidence presented does support the opposing stance, it is not enough to conclude that urbanization should not be fought against. 

Urbanization should not be viewed as a completely negative process. However, unchecked urbanization can lead to negative consequences such as overcrowding, increased air pollution, and a strain on public infrastructure and services. Furthermore, while the economic benefits of urbanization are undeniable, it should also be taken into consideration that urbanization often displaces rural people, leading to an increase in poverty levels. Additionally, while green technology may be one of the outcomes of urbanization, without sufficient oversight and regulations, cities can end up becoming hubs of pollution and environmental degradation. 

In conclusion, it is not enough to argue that urbanization should not be fought against, due to the potential negative consequences of unchecked urbanization. Therefore, it is important to ensure that any urbanization is done in a responsible and sustainable manner."
We should fight urbanization,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.

- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
","
In this debate, those who argue for fighting urbanization state that restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically and socially, that urbanization causes crime, harms the environment, and strains cities' resources. As evidence, Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; MÄori leaders and government policymakers have struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems; increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies; and a UNESCO report detailed low levels of living, inadequate housing, lack of sanitary facilities, filth, and high mortality and a lack of educational facilities. Therefore, we should fight urbanization in order to protect the people in the rural areas, reduce crime, protect the environment, and ensure cities have access to the resources they need."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
- claim_4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..
","
In this debate, the topic is whether we should introduce compulsory voting. Those opposing the stance argue that abstaining from a vote is also reflecting preferences, citizens have a right not to vote, compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, and not everyone has the ability to go to vote. To support their arguments, evidence is provided which states that abstention can be used to indicate ambivalence or mild disapproval, compelled speech act violates freedom of speech, uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending, and people may be voting based on intentional disinformation. In conclusion, compulsory voting may be difficult to enforce and can have unintended consequences, and thus is a complicated issue that deserves further consideration."

In this debate, we will be discussing whether we should introduce compulsory voting. The positive supporters of this stance argue that compulsory voting increases representation, causes people to become more interested in politics, and people have an obligation to vote. Evidence to support this stance includes a report by Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne Jr. that highlights the disparities in turnout between different groups, suggesting that boosting turnout is a matter of justice and representation. Additionally, it has been argued that compulsory voting increases the political education of the people, and the European Court of Human Rights ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms.

- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
- claim_5: Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Take California for example: first in the nation to legalize the medical use of the drug in 1996, the state would go on to legalize recreational use in 2016. But in just the past year, the state reported several massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza – just over the last three or four months..
","
In the debate over whether we should legalize cannabis, the opponents argue that cannabis harms the body, increases lack-of-judgement/accidents, is a gateway-drug/addictive, can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children, and will boost the black-market/criminal activity. 

Evidence of cannabis' potential harms to the body include a 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore that found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Anslinger, a US government official, also claimed that cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. 

The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) argues that the chemical THC in cannabis triggers brain cells to release dopamine, which leads to addiction. Gordon Brown, former prime minister of the United Kingdom, has also argued against reclassifying cannabis in any way that could make it more acceptable to teenagers, as this could have serious consequences.

Finally, even in states where cannabis has been legalized, large illegal operations have still been found. For instance, in California, 20 tons of cannabis were confiscated off farms, an $8 million worth of plants was found in a warehouse, and over 100 illegal operations were busted in Anza. 

All of this evidence strongly suggests that legalizing cannabis could have serious and potentially devastating consequences, and therefore should not be legalized."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..
","
In summary, the debate for the legalization of cannabis is based on the idea that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal, as well as on the potential financial and health benefits of cannabis, including reducing criminal activity and respecting the right of individuals to do whatever they want to their own bodies. Supporters of this topic present evidence that marijuana has caused only two possible drug-induced deaths compared to the half a million deaths caused by legal drugs, that cannabis can be financially beneficial, and that it is safe, pain-relieving, and could be regulated. They also point out that downgrading cannabis to class C in the UK had reduced usage in the 16-24 age group, and that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking. Lastly, they cite John Stuart Mill's harm principle to argue that individuals should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies."

Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..

In the debate concerning whether prostitution should be legalized or not, opponents of legalization argue that such a policy would lead to an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, immoral behavior such as pimping, trafficking and organized crime, and violence against women. In addition, they point out that selling one's body is morally wrong. Evidence to support these claims includes a survey conducted in Athens in the late 1980s which found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive, a report written in 2005 that found that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and abused, and the unintended consequences of the proposed legislation in Sweden which increased the risk of violence and harmed the most vulnerable. Furthermore, feminists argue that prostitution is a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
","
The debate topic is ""We should legalize prostitution"". It is argued that legalizing prostitution would boost the economy, increase sex workers' benefits, allow for regulation of those in the profession, make it safer for women, and be a valid choice over one's own body. Historical evidence such as the belief of Seattle's founder David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy, and the Dutch policy of tolerating prostitution for harm reduction purposes, are used to support the argument. A 2009 study on the subjective well-being of prostitutes also found that among those surveyed, sex work had become normalized. This suggests that legalizing prostitution would bring forth numerous benefits."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
","
This debate is about whether we should legalize sex selection. The opponents of this motion argue that it could lead to gender imbalance, reaffirm gender stereotypes/biases, and create abortions/infanticide. Evidence in support of these claims shows that in countries such as India and China, having boys is preferred over having girls, leading to a ratio of men to women that is unbalanced. This reinforces gender stereotypes and can lead to female infanticide under compulsory measures like the one-child policy in China."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
","
The topic of this debate is 'We should legalize sex selection', with the positive stance that it should be legalized. Supporters of this stance argue that legalizing sex selection is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child; it allows for better family planning, makes the family more happy/complete, prevents diseases in the child and will prevent abortions/infanticide. Evidence supporting these claims includes the fact that people have slight preferences for a specific gender, it offers effective control over the number of children wanted, it allows for parents to adopt offspring of a particular sex, and it can prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Ultimately, it allows intended parents to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
","
In conclusion, the debate topic of 'We should prohibit flag burning' is supported by the opponents. The arguments put forth by the opponents is that flag burning is an effective tool of expression, protest and critique, and that it is justified due to the freedom of expression. Evidence to support the arguments include the 1984 court ruling in favor of Gregory Lee Johnson, in which Justice Brennan ruled that flag burning is an act of expression and thus protected by the First Amendment."

We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
","
Summary: This debate is about whether or not women should be prohibited from serving in combat. The opponents of the motion argue that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men, that they are an asset in combat, that they bring unique skills and strategies, and that they can be just as capable in combat as men. Additionally, they contend that women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to and that they should be accepted as long as they pass the necessary tests. This is supported by evidence such as the principle of equal pay for equal work enshrined in the European Treaties, the roles of women in the military since the Revolutionary War, the leadership skills demonstrated by women in the military, the success of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, and the introduction of Physical Employment Standards and Role Fitness Tests by the Army."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
","
The topic of the debate is 'We should prohibit women in combat'. Supporters of this position argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women due to biological differences in size, strength, and aerobic capacity; that women are unable to overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers; that women can be a distraction or harm the functioning of the military; that women should serve in safer roles; and that women soldier capture is a big concern. 

Evidence provided in support of this argument includes: that women are generally physically smaller than men with less bone mass and muscle density, making it harder for them to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness; the British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units; Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced concerns that men would be distracted by the sight of women in harm's way; in 2014 the IDF noted that fewer than 4 percent of women were in combat positions such as infantry, artillery, and fighter pilots; and that women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men."

- claim_2: It is preferable to spend the money elsewhere.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Postal subsidies from our nation’s early founding (cited as a precedent by Downie/Schudson and McChesney/Nichols) are irrelevant. We had one communication medium then, newspapers. In today’s world of multiple forms of print, broadcast and digital communication, federal subsidies would decide winners and losers, protecting inefficient companies and creating huge obstacles for entrepreneurs..
- claim_3: Journalism is like every other business and if it is not sustainable it should fail.

This debate is about whether we should subsidize journalism. Proponents argue that subsidizing journalism can benefit the public by promoting the flow of truthful information. Opponents claim that subsidizing journalism has the risk of inserting bias or harming objectivity, it is preferable to spend the money elsewhere, and journalism is like every other business and should not be bailed out if it is unsustainable. They cite evidence such as that political endorsements create opportunities for favoritism and bias, postal subsidies from the nation's early founding are no longer relevant with the number of communication mediums now available, and that the federal government can't afford to bail out newspapers, as they have already bailed out undeserving banks and automobile manufacturers."
We should subsidize journalism,1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..
- claim_2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news..
- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The IFJ launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative in 2008, a global campaign to defend standards and to raise awareness of the importance of quality journalism..
- claim_4: Subsidy increases objectivity in reporting.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Peace journalism, by presenting anomalous local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism, may help to expose these violent group's attempts to fix and naturalise meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence..
","
This debate concerns the question of whether we should subsidize journalism. Supporters of the motion argue that a subsidy is important to make journalism viable; that journalism is important to information-spreading and accountability; that subsidies will increase the quality of journalism; and that subsidies will increase objectivity in reporting. In order to substantiate these claims, supporters of the motion have highlighted evidence that shows that, due to the availability of digital tools such as blogs, it has become difficult to distinguish fact from fiction; that the Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient in providing accurate and factual reporting on state and national events; that the International Federation of Journalists launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative to defend standards and promote quality journalism; and that peace journalism may help expose violent groups by presenting local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism. From this evidence, we can conclude that subsidies should be allocated to journalism to ensure its viability, promote information-spreading and accountability, increase its quality, and increase objectivity in reporting."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,gpt3,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
","
In the debate on whether we should subsidize space exploration, one side argues that it should be left to the private sector, citing the success of SpaceX in providing services for NASA and the immense costs of space travel, as well as the ineffectiveness of past space exploration projects. On the other side, it is argued that there are more pressing matters on which funds should be spent, such as poverty. The evidence provided shows that the cost of space travel is high and that the projects to date have produced limited scientific advances, as well as highlighting the tragedy of global poverty."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
","
In conclusion, the positive stance for subsidizing space exploration is well-supported by five claims, each with evidence to back it. Space exploration can help colonize other planets, improve science and technology, be financially beneficial, be necessary for humanity’s survival, and unravel information about the universe. Therefore, space exploration should be subsidized as it can bring many advantages to the world."

    - Evidence 1: A study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that vocational education programs can address workforce shortages in specific fields and industries, which can benefit the entire market and society by filling in-demand jobs..
","
The debate topic is: ""We should subsidize vocational education"". The affirmative side of this debate believes that subsidizing vocational education will be beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. The first argument is that subsidizing vocational education can promote those with fewer resources, as found in a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019. The second argument is that vocational education better fits many students, according to a study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in 2020. The third argument is that vocational education is a good career choice, according to a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022. Lastly, the fourth argument is that vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society, as demonstrated by a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019. The evidence shows that subsidizing vocational education can help promote those with fewer resources, provide a more direct path to employment, offer training and education for high-demand jobs, and address workforce shortages. Therefore, the affirmative side of this debate strongly believes that subsidizing vocational education is beneficial for individuals and society as a whole."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
","
The debate topic is: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'. The opponents argue that assisted suicide should not be criminalized because it provides dignity to the person that wants to commit it, reduces suffering, allows individuals to have the freedom to choose to end their life, and benefits terminally ill patients. Evidence supporting these claims includes research from Dignity in Dying which shows that around 350 Britons have traveled to Switzerland to end their life due to a lack of protection from the law, criteria from the legal system concerning unbearable and hopeless suffering, and autonomy and quality-of-life-based arguments in favour of euthanasia. It is clear that the opponents to this debate believe that assisted suicide should not be criminalized."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'. The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made..
- claim_3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dr. Lynda Young, MD, stated her opposition when she said, 'Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'.
- claim_4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
","
In conclusion, this debate centers around the question of whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offence or not. The positive stance of the debate argues that assisted suicide should be a criminal offence due to its ability to solicit someone to die to their own benefit, the possibility of people getting better, the violation of a doctor's role, the right to self-harm/harm others, and the lack of clear judgement from people who are ill. Evidence was provided for each of these points, including examples such as the need for a patient to be an adult in a certain medical condition, the physician-assisted suicide not being performed for the sake of a patient's depression, and the lack of proof that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:

- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.

Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
","
Debate Script Summary: 
The debate is about the controversial topic of whether homeschooling should be banned or not. The affirmative side argues that homeschooling should be banned as it cannot be regulated or standardized, which puts vulnerable children at risk and prevents them from gaining essential social skills. They also point out that mainstream schools have higher educational quality and parents are not qualified as teachers to provide the depth and breadth of learning their children require. The evidence used to support their claims are: (1) Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized due to the lack of social safety nets and the increased chance of child abuse; (2) mainstream schools are essential for social skills and democratic values; (3) mainstream schools are of higher educational quality and; (4) parents are not qualified as teachers to provide the necessary depth and breadth of learning their children require."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as in the European Convention on Human Rights..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Mayo Clinic states that natural infection 'often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.'.
","
The debate topic at hand is 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'. Proponents of the idea believe that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory in order to protect children against potentially deadly illnesses and provide public health benefits. However, opponents of the idea have three primary claims against making such vaccinations mandatory. 

The first claim is that routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous. This is supported by the example of Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, which was pulled from the market after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction). 

The second claim is that mandatory vaccinations contradict basic rights. Evidence supporting this claim is found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity.

The third claim is that routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy. Evidence to support this claim can be found in Mayo Clinic, which states that natural infection often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.

In conclusion, proponents and opponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations have well-founded arguments for their respective positions. However, with the availability of evidence to support the safety and necessity of routine vaccinations, proponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations are the ones with the stronger argument."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..
","
In conclusion, routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. This is because they are effective, save lives, and help to protect others from preventable diseases. Evidence supporting this claim includes the 69% drop in the rate of invasive pneumococcal disease in those of less than two years of age after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, and the 74% decrease in childhood deaths from measles due to the measles vaccine. Additionally, the pertussis vaccine has been effective at preventing illness, saving an estimated half a million lives in 2002, and preventing the biggest pertussis outbreak since 1955. Vaccine hesitancy has also contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases, with measles cases increasing by 30% in 2019. Therefore, in order to prevent virus/disease spreading, routine child vaccinations should be mandatory."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Lack of enforcement of the European Union’s data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., has also cast a shadow over the new laws..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
","
This debate is about whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. The opposition argues that regulation is ineffective, harms privacy, hinders freedom of speech and other democratic rights, is an intrusion into the affairs of private companies, and could lead to political abuses by the government. Evidence provided in support of these claims includes the lack of enforcement of the European Union's data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation; a survey of US adults revealing a lack of control over personal information; reports of Facebook restricting Vietnamese content following the passage of a cybersecurity law; US debate regarding government intervention in the market system; and political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 US and UK elections."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
","
The debate topic is ‘Social media platforms should be regulated by the government’, and it is in support of the affirmative side. It is argued that social media regulation is essential to protect the younger audiences, to deal with fake news, to benefit society at large, to help with negative content, and to deal with malicious users. As evidence, a statement from Matt Lamb in a statement saying that the government must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation; Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu's question on whether Twitter has killed the First Amendment; a statement from Ofcom’s Chief Executive on the need for sensible, balanced rules; Pierre DeBois' remarks on enterprises' need to pay attention to how social media platforms impact the real world; and a survey finding that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011 are presented. From the evidence, it can be seen that the regulation of social media is important in order to protect audiences, to combat fake news, to benefit society, to tackle negative content, and to address malicious users."

  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..

In summary, the US is a great country to live in due to its excellent economy, healthcare and education systems, stunning nature and environment, democratic rights and freedoms, a unique culture, great people and powerful nation status, as well as a plethora of opportunities for individuals. Evidence from Caleb Silver with Investopedia states that the US controls the top spot in the rankings of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The advanced medical milieu that Americans enjoy has led to the world’s best cancer survival rates and lower mortality rates for heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, the US is home to an abundance of wildlife, protected by the National Park Service, as well as a bill of rights ensuring democratic rights and freedoms for all. The 'melting pot' of cultures has created an American culture which is now impacting the world.

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:

- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep..

The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
","
The debate topic is 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned'. Proponents of this idea believe that celibacy should be abolished, while opponents argue that it should be retained. Opponents of the vow of celibacy argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, is a strong religious belief, makes the priests to be perceived as holy, is chosen by priests, and religious experiences and traditions should be maintained. Furthermore, they state that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts. To support their claims, opponents cite evidence such as that clerical celibacy is seen as a special gift from God and that a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests, and deacons should abstain from conjugal relations. Furthermore, they point out that celibacy became almost universal when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men and that a law had not been promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Additionally, they state that Siricius declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple and that priests have undergone psycho-sexual development training. Thus, opponents of the vow of celibacy present a strong case for why celibacy should be retained."

This debate topic is ""The vow of celibacy should be abandoned"". The positive argument states that celibacy is outdated, too pressuring, unhealthy and unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Supporting evidence includes Lakeland's belief that celibacy should become optional and that change is inevitable, Elizabeth Abbott's belief that suppressing urges and hiding sexual behaviour warps people, the fact that celibacy is an unnatural act for all living organisms, the connection between celibacy and the clergy sexual abuse scandals and Gerard's complaint about the York canons refusing to be ordained as priests. In conclusion, given all this evidence, it is clear that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned."

    - Evidence 1: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:

In the given debate, the opponents argue that we should not abandon marriage as it benefits children, it is important for people, makes them happy, makes the couple closer and provides important financial benefits. The evidence supporting this argument includes that children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused, have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, and are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager. Additionally, marriage is important for people either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons, as it is one of life's greatest blessings, helps to reduce mental and behavioral disorders, criminal activity, and substance abuse. Additionally, it provides people with happiness, makes them closer, and gives important financial benefits such as the higher standard deduction for a couple."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
","
In conclusion, marriage should be abandoned because it preserves norms that are harmful to women, is unstable, ties people up with unfair obligations, and most of the advantages of marriage are achieved through a monogamous relationship. To begin, research has shown that the effects of marriage are worse for women than men and that women initiate a majority of divorces due to the negative effects. Additionally, the claim that ""half of marriages end in divorce"" was once true but even in its time, marriage meant an obligation for wives to obey their husbands and serve them. Finally, although marriage promises many benefits, a monogamous relationship is just as capable of fostering emotional intimacy and long-lasting relationships. Therefore, marriage should be abandoned in favor of a monogamous relationship for these reasons."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..
","
In this debate, we argue that school uniform should be abandoned. Evidence has been presented to show that children can still express themselves in other ways, which does not involve clothing regulations, and that free speech is guaranteed by the Constitution. On the contrary, school uniform reduces bullying, as research by the Schoolwear Association has shown, as well as creating a sense of equality and unity. Additionally, they encourage discipline and focus on learning by taking away the students’ focus from their attire and from their peers’ thoughts. Lastly, the cost savings are minimal, according to a national survey of 517 US school leaders. Thus, the evidence presented suggests that school uniform should not be imposed and should be abandoned."

When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","
In summary, this debate is about whether or not we should abandon the use of school uniforms. Supporters of this stance argue that school uniform can harm learning and creativity, restrict students' self-expression, be expensive, be uncomfortable or sexist and increase conformity or harm individuality. Senior Alyse Madsen said that strict dress codes infringe on a student's self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity. Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show that students often feel uniforms allow for comparison between their bodies and others. Research by the Children's Society showed that the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. According to a GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students. Furthermore, research has shown that allowing students to dress themselves can help with independent thinking and better prepare them for adulthood. All of these factors taken together make a strong argument for why we should abandon the use of school uniforms."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","
The debate topic being discussed is 'We should abolish capital punishment'. Those in favor of abolishing the death penalty argue that it does not bring closure to the victims’ families, is not a suitable punishment for the most heinous of crimes, and it does not serve as an effective deterrent. On the other hand, opponents of abolishing the death penalty argue that it can bring closure to the victims’ families, can be suitable for certain crimes, and can deter potential criminals. 

Evidence supporting those in favor of abolishing capital punishment includes that the United Nations Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights argues that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. Further, a study conducted by Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd found that executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. 

Evidence for the opponents of abolishing capital punishment includes an article written by Leslie Rutledge, JD, and Tom Cotton, JD, that argued capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. The article also noted that the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. It also provides an example of Daniel Lewis Lee, a member of a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution. 

In conclusion, the debate regarding whether we should abolish capital punishment is a complex one with strong arguments for both sides. Opponents argue that the death penalty can bring closure to victims’ families, is an appropriate punishment for severe crimes, and can be an effective deterrent. Supporters of abolishing the death penalty argue that the death penalty does not bring closure to the victims’ families, is not suitable for the most heinous of crimes, and it does not serve as an effective deterrent. Ultimately, this debate is one that must be resolved on a case-by-case basis."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
","
This debate is about the abolishment of capital punishment, with the affirmative side claiming that state-sanctioned killing is wrong, that it harms the disenfranchised and that it is irreversible. To support their claims, they cite evidence that the death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner, that its financial cost is eight times greater than a non-death penalty case and that statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it. Furthermore, H. Lee Sarokin claims that deterrence does not play a part in the decision to commit murder, making capital punishment an unnecessary risk. Therefore, it is clear that capital punishment should be abolished."

Furthermore, a joint research project by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth. In addition, copyright preserves intellectual property like movies, music, and television shows.

In this debate, we will be discussing whether we should abolish intellectual property rights. Those who support the abolition of intellectual property rights argue that they prevent the continuous improvement of a service or product, restrict access to important information or products, are unfair, harm creativity and innovation, waste money, and are ineffective. 
Evidence suggests that intellectual property monopolies can impede health (in the case of pharmaceutical patents), prevent progress, and benefit concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses. Users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable, and this conduct is so poorly defined. Additionally, Roderick T. Long has argued that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Petra Moser has also asserted that patent policies which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors may discourage innovation. Further, the costs of obtaining intellectual property rights can be expensive. Lastly, Tucker did not believe in intellectual property rights in the form of patents, on the grounds that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot rightfully be held as property. 
Based on this evidence, it appears that intellectual property rights have many potential drawbacks, and should be abolished to benefit the public."

This debate addresses the topic of whether we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. Opponents of the motion argue that gun control is ineffective, that gun ownership is a right, that gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting, and that it promotes self protection. To support the claim that gun control is ineffective, opponents cite a 2016 Lancet study that found that most state-level gun control laws did not reduce firearm death rates, and that of the 25 state laws studied, nine were associated with higher gun death rates. The opponents also note that gun ownership is a right and that it is held in nearly the same esteem as other rights laid out in the US Constitution, according to a survey conducted by Gallup.

In this debate, the affirmative position proposes that the right to keep and bear arms should be abolished. The affirmative position is based on four main claims. Firstly, that banning guns would save lives, supported by evidence from Missouri, which showed a 25 percent increase in gun-related killings after the repeal of the state’s permit law. Secondly, that gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence, supported by research showing that for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership, there will be three to five more mass shootings per five years. Thirdly, that guns can fall into the wrong hands, supported by an example from Texas where a man with a domestic violence conviction was able to buy guns and carry out a massacre. Finally, that guns lead to accidental deaths, supported by a 2001 study that showed a correlation between gun ownership and unintentional firearm injuries. The affirmative position argues that these risks to human life make it necessary to abolish the right to keep and bear arms."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: “For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..

In this debate, the topic is 'We should adopt an austerity regime.' The proponents argue that austerity is necessary to maintain a healthy economy, while the opponents argue that it has several detrimental effects such as reducing access to essential services, extending recessions, creating more unemployment, reducing growth, and being unfair to citizens. Evidence to support the opponent's claims includes the Institute of Fiscal Studies’ estimation of a 0.4% cut to unprotected areas of social security, prisons, local government, and adult education; the financial press and many economists’ observations of slow recovery in several European countries; a significant association between IMF-required austerity and rising inequality as well as poverty levels; the OECD average slowing from 5% before the crisis to 2.5% after the crisis; and Alessandro Turrini’s finding that austerity policies may be responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.

This debate is about whether we should adopt an austerity regime. Supporters of this stance argue that austerity has a number of economic and stability benefits. For example, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina has shown that fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions.' Further, according to Arellano (2008) model simulations, cutting government consumption may raise the default premium in the short run. Austerity can also increase stability by providing a buffer against external shocks as seen in the German model of adjustment, which compensates for the contraction of internal demand with increased external demand. Moreover, austerity can be used to reduce deficits and pay debts, as was seen in the US between 1920 and 1921, where the federal budget was cut by almost 50%, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. Finally, it can be used to stimulate growth during economically troubled times."

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..

The debate is over the proposition that we should adopt atheism. Opponents argue that atheism discriminates against religious people/violates freedom of religion, atheism lacks morality, and people should choose for themselves whether atheism should be adopted. Evidence given for the first claim is that the Albanian Constitution of 1976 and the Penal Code of 1977 both imposed prison sentences for religious propaganda and production, distribution, or storage of religious literature. Evidence for the second claim is that Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life. Lastly, evidence for the third claim is from Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs as prescribed by law and as necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Opponents of the proposition are making the case that we should not adopt atheism because it discriminates against religious people, lacks morality, and people should have the right to choose for themselves whether they wish to adopt atheism."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
","
Summary:
This debate focuses on the argument that people should adopt atheism. The proponents of this view suggest that atheism is beneficial to those who choose to adopt it since they are free from any confusions that may arise from religious texts. Additionally, atheism is obligatory due to a lack of evidence of God's existence. Moreover, religions may be immoral and advocate for practices that are unjust, such as the Bible teaching people to treat their slaves. Lastly, science can adequately explain the Universe and this might be one of the greatest contributions to civilization that scientists can make."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
","
This debate is about whether we should adopt libertarianism, which is a philosophical view that advocates for individual liberty and limited government intervention. Proponents of libertarianism argue that it promotes economic growth, protects individual liberty, and ensures equal justice. However, opponents of libertarianism argue that it harms economic growth, harms minorities/those who are worse off, is unjust/non-equal, removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services, and does not protect the rights of citizens. 

The opponents of libertarianism present evidence to support their claims, including that right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, leading to monopolies and stifled innovation. Furthermore, James P. Sterba argued that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises requires the redistribution of wealth in order to improve economic health. Economist Joseph Stiglitz also argues that market failures can result in unequal outcomes, requiring government intervention to address. In addition, environmentalists argue that markets fail to address important social needs and that government action is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, libertarians cannot protect the rights of citizens, as this is the role of the government. 

In conclusion, while proponents of libertarianism may argue that it promotes individual liberty and economic growth, the evidence provided by opponents suggests that it is not an effective system for addressing social issues, protecting the rights of citizens, and ensuring economic stability."
We should adopt libertarianism,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism increases economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to freely associate with others, a libertarian system can promote greater cooperation, understanding, and social support. For example, sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
","
In this debate, we will argue that we should adopt libertarianism as a system of governance. This stance is supported by evidence that libertarianism increases economic growth, increases freedom in the political system, increases happiness/fulfillment, and increases individual freedom/liberties. For example, Americans for Limited Government argue that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity. Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. Sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness. Lastly, economist Murray Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle is based on the premise that either a group of people can own another group of people, or no single person has full ownership over one's self. Ultimately, the only alternative is self-ownership, which is both axiomatic and universal. Therefore, libertarianism increases economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfillment, and individual freedom/liberties."

In summary, this debate is about whether or not we should ban human cloning. The opponents of this motion are arguing that cloning should not be banned because it can be used for organ replication, to help those who can’t otherwise have a child, to promote health, and to promote science and research. Evidence to support these arguments includes a study from the Journal of the American Medical Association which found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases; a study from the New England Journal of Medicine which found that cloning can help to reduce the transmission of genetic diseases; a study from the Fertility and Sterility journal which found that cloning could be used to better understand the processes of reproduction; and a study from the Journal of Evolutionary Biology which found that cloning can help to better understand the process of evolution."

In this debate, we are discussing the issue of whether we should ban human cloning. Supporters of the ban argue that cloning is not understood enough yet, that it is unethical/anti-religious, that it is unnatural, and that it is unsafe. As evidence, they cite Kass's argument that a society which tolerates cloning has forgotten how to shudder and has said yes to converting procreation into manufacture. They also point to the Holy See's position that cloning for research purposes is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one. They further cite Richard McCormick's view that cloning disrupts the familial order by removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, as well as a report by the Council of Europe which highlights the potential for abuse of cloning technology. Taken together, these arguments provide strong support for banning human cloning."

We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..

- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..
","
This debate is about whether we should close Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp. The opposition believes that closing the camp would harm national security, it is better for prisoners than the alternatives, and is essential to gain intelligence. The evidence to support the claim that closing the camp would harm national security is that 17.5 percent of former Guantanamo detainees have reengaged in terrorist or insurgent activities, with 111 of those detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven transferred during the Obama administration. Additionally, an estimated 12.7 percent of all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. 

The evidence to support the claim that Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is better for prisoners than the alternatives is that it is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the world's population.

The evidence to support the claim that the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is essential to gain intelligence is that key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'. 

Given the evidence presented, it is clear that closing Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp could have serious implications for national security, the safety of prisoners, and the ability to gain important intelligence. Therefore, the opposition believes that the camp should not be closed."

    - Evidence 1: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
","
In the debate on the closing of Guantanamo Bay detention camp, the positive supporters claim that the detainees have the right to trial in US courts, as the US Supreme Court has ruled that prisoners held for more than two years may challenge their captivity in US courts. They also argue that the detention camp harms the US image and serves as a recruiting tool for terrorists, due to its tarnished reputation of injustice and oppression. Additionally, the detention camp is extremely expensive, with its cost estimated to be $2.7 million per prisoner, and personnel commit crimes against the prisoners, including physical abuse and torture. Finally, unjust treatment and tactics are used in the camp, such as depriving detainees of sleep, shackling them in painful positions and forcing them to drink large amounts of water. All of these arguments, as evidenced by the given evidence, serve to demonstrate that Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed."
We should end affirmative action,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, the APALC submitted a brief supporting the University of Texas in preserving the use of affirmative action in admissions, saying Asian students 'benefited from exposure to a diverse student body.'.
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As historian Roger Wilkins has pointed out, Blacks have a 375-year history on this continent: 245 involving slavery, 100 involving legalized discrimination, and only 30 involving anything else (Wilkins, 1995). Jews and Asians, on the other hand, have immigrated to North America—often as doctors, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs, and so forth. Moreover, European Jews are able to function as part of the White majority. To expect Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians is to deny the historical and social reality that Black people face..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals..
","
This debate is centered around whether or not we should end affirmative action. Proponents of the motion believe that it should be ended, while opponents argue that it is beneficial for diversity, necessary to compensate for the past, and effective at reducing discrimination. To support these claims, opponents cite the case of Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, in which the APALC argued that Asian students 'benefited from exposure to a diverse student body.' In addition, historian Roger Wilkins has argued that Blacks have had a long history of discrimination and oppression that should be taken into account, as opposed to expecting Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians, which is unrealistic. Finally, the example of Wesolowski supporting affirmative action for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001 is used to illustrate how affirmative action can reduce discrimination against women and aboriginals. 

In conclusion, it is clear that there are several arguments in favor of affirmative action, demonstrating that it is beneficial to diversity, necessary to combat discrimination, and necessary to compensate for the injustices of the past."

This debate topic is whether we should end affirmative action. Those who support this stance argue that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Evidence 1, related to the first claim, is a case where Harvard University is being sued for capping the number of admissions for Asian American students, which is celebrated on the backs of minorities. Evidence 1, related to the second claim, shows that privileged African Americans are gaining professional upward mobility, while the less-skilled and less-educated African Americans fall behind. Evidence 1, related to the third claim, is the same as for the first, showing that Harvard University is being sued for capping the number of admissions for Asian American students. Evidence 1, related to the fourth claim, is also the same as for the first, with Harvard University being sued for capping the number of admissions for Asian American students. Lastly, Evidence 1, related to the fifth claim, is data from the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, which reveals large differences in mean SAT scores and mean high-school grade-point averages across different races.

The debate topic is 'We should end mandatory retirement'. The positive stance is that mandatory retirement is detrimental and should be abolished. Claim_1 states that a mandatory retirement age decreases institutional knowledge, evidenced by the example of commercial airline pilots in the United States, whose retirement age was increased from 60 to 65 in 2007. Claim_2 argues that a mandatory retirement age harms the economy, as it limits labor market flexibility and employers' ability to respond to changing economic conditions, according to a study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019. Claim_3 posits that a mandatory retirement is not fair or equitable, as it promotes intergenerational inequity, reducing the diversity of skills and experiences available in the workplace and limiting opportunities for intergenerational collaboration, according to a study by the World Economic Forum in 2016.

The debate surrounds the topic of whether or not we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Those who oppose this stance assert that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. They back this up with evidence that deterrence has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years, and that countries with nuclear weapons are seen as more powerful and can therefore deter aggression from other nations."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
","
In this debate, we are discussing whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Those who support this position argue that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands, as evidenced by cases of theft and loss of nuclear materials that are sometimes never recovered. It is also argued that nuclear weapons can provoke or escalate a disastrous military action, as demonstrated by the constellation of incidents around the Cuban Missile Crisis. These events suggest that when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences will lead to a major crisis, and that luck was the only thing that saved us from a disastrous outcome during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Therefore, the supporters of this position believe that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons."

- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..

In this debate, we are discussing the merits and drawbacks of urbanization. On the one hand, opponents of the motion argue that cities offer more opportunities, as people from rural areas move to larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Urbanization also has the potential to benefit the economy, as it could lead to more efficient economies, technological developments, diversity of products and occupations, and greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility. Lastly, it could also benefit the environment, as urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. On the other hand, those who fight urbanization believe that it can lead to the overcrowding of cities, displacement of people, and destruction of rural areas. They argue that the advantages of urbanization are outweighed by its negative effects on the environment, economy, and society."

In this debate, the topic of discussion is ‘We should fight urbanization’. It is argued that restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically and socially, that urbanization causes crime, harms the environment, and is causing a strain on the cities' resources. Evidence supporting this position includes findings from a study in India which showed that protection of natural resources eliminated causes of rural to urban migration, and surveys which revealed that urbanization and coastal development contributed to increased degradation of the marine environment. Additionally, the rapid process of urbanization had the consequence of creating irregular neighborhoods. Therefore, it is clear that the impacts of urbanization need to be countered through appropriate regulations and measures."

In the debate about whether compulsory voting should be introduced or not, the opponents of the topic argue that abstaining from a vote is a way of reflecting one's preferences, citizens have a right not to vote, compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, and not everyone has the ability to go to vote. This is evidenced by Herbert Spencer noting that abstaining from a vote would be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, Minchin’s statement that compulsory voting is a breach of civil liberties, the fact that uninformed or random votes can skew election results and decrease civic engagement, and a poll showing that many Americans lack basic knowledge of the Constitution and may be voting based on intentional disinformation.

If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..

This debate is on whether or not we should introduce compulsory voting. Supporters of the affirmative side argue that it will lead to greater representation, increased interest in politics, and fulfill a citizen's obligation to vote. Evidence supporting these claims includes the fact that compulsory voting will mean that candidates will have to address the needs of all the voters, leading to fairer representation. It will also increase the legitimacy of elected representatives, as they will be elected by the majority of the people.

- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..

    - Evidence 1: Take California for example: first in the nation to legalize the medical use of the drug in 1996, the state would go on to legalize recreational use in 2016. But in just the past year, the state reported several massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza – just over the last three or four months..

    - Evidence 1: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..

The debate topic is 'We should legalize cannabis'. This debate is in favor of legalizing cannabis. It has been argued that legalizing cannabis is beneficial due to its comparative low level of health risk compared to other legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, its potential to provide financial savings, its possible medical and therapeutic applications, and its ability to reduce criminal activity and illicit drug use. Supporters also suggest that individuals should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies, as long as it does not cause harm to others. 

To support this argument, evidence has been presented that cannabis poses fewer health risks than certain legal drugs, and that its legalization could result in financial savings and a reduction in criminal activity. Further, it has been argued that individuals have the right to do whatever they want with their own bodies, so long as it does not cause harm to others. 

In conclusion, legalizing cannabis could provide a number of benefits, both economically and socially. Therefore, we should legalize cannabis."
We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence..
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..
","
In the debate on the topic 'We should legalize prostitution', it is argued that such legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, more immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking, and increase violence against women. It is also claimed that selling one's body is immoral. To back up these claims, evidence has been presented showing that in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population. Additionally, Maxwell (2000) and other researchers have found substantial evidence of a link between prostitution and drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes. Giobbe (1993) also found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence. Some feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client, thus reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client. 

To conclude, opponents of legalizing prostitution argue that this would lead to an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, immoral behaviour, violence against women, and would be immoral itself due to the power imbalance and exploitation it can involve. All of these arguments have been supported with evidence."

- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..

Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..
","
In the debate about whether we should legalize prostitution, the affirmative side takes the stance that legalizing prostitution would boost the economy, increase sex workers' benefits, allow for better regulation of the profession, make it safer for women, and be an empowering and valid choice for those in the profession. 

Evidence to support the affirmative stance includes the fact that one of Seattle's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, believed that prostitution could be a functional part of the economy; the Ministry of Justice of 2003 held a public discussion on legalizing prostitution as an official occupation; Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman acknowledged that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex; China launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan; and Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, holds that prostitution is not bad if done with consent."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
","
This debate is on whether we should legalize sex selection. Proponents of this claim argue that it could provide a way for couples to plan their families and reduce gender discrimination. However, opponents argue that legalizing sex selection can lead to gender imbalance, reaffirm gender stereotypes/biases and create abortions/infanticide. Evidence shows that son preference has resulted in around 140 million women being ‘missing’ from society due to gender-biased sex selection. This form of discrimination has been found to have a damaging effect on societies. Additionally, opponents have expressed ethical and moral concerns over parents deliberately choosing the sex of their baby. It has also been found that sex-selective abortions were associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions. Thus, the evidence suggests that legalizing sex selection could have serious social, ethical and moral implications."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
","
The debate is about whether we should legalize sex selection. Proponents of this view argue that it should be legalized because it is within the rights of parents to select the sex of their child, it allows for better family planning, makes the family happier and more complete, prevents diseases in the child, and will prevent abortions and infanticide. Evidence supporting these claims shows that it will enable couples to have an adequate number of children, gives parents effective control over the number of children they want, provides parents the opportunity to have the gender of their choice, gives them the chance to select embryos that do not have a genetic disorder, and finally, prevents the intentional killing of baby girls due to gender preference."

","
In this debate, we will be discussing whether we should prohibit flag burning. Opponents to this view argue that flag burning is an effective tool of expression, protest and critique, and is justified due to freedom of expression. The first claim is supported by evidence which states that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment and individuals have the right to make their speech as effective as possible. The second claim is also supported by evidence which states that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive. Thus, these claims are used to support the argument that flag burning should not be prohibited."

In this debate, we will discuss whether we should prohibit flag burning. The affirmative team stands in support of the idea that we should prohibit flag burning. Our first claim is that flags are important symbols that should be respected. This is evidenced by the fact that just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. This shows that the flag is an important symbol that should be respected and held to a higher standard. Our second claim is that flag burning is an inflammatory act. This is evidenced by the ordinance in Hong Kong, which states that a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration. Thus, it is clear that flag burning is an inflammatory act that should be prohibited."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
","
Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', the opposition's stance is that women should be allowed to serve in combat as long as they pass the tests. Their argument consists of six main points and associated evidence to support the claim. The first point is that there should be equality between men and women in health, labor, and other areas. This is supported by evidence that fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and life expectancy for women is increasing in almost every country. Women are also engaging in economic activities beyond the home in countries of all income levels. The second point is that women are an asset in combat as warfare is changing to become more high-tech, making physical strength less important. The third point is that women can create unique skills and strategies. This is evidenced by the fact that in World War II, female snipers roamed the front lines and killed Germans with advanced telescopic rifles. The fourth point is that women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat as men. Evidence for this is provided by the creation of the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death in 1917, which was the first to go over the top and successfully seize a trench line. The fifth point is that women should be able to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. The sixth point is that women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests as having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly. Therefore, based on the argument and evidence provided, women should be allowed to serve in combat as long as they pass the tests."

- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
","
This debate is on whether we should prohibit women in combat or not. The positive side of the debate claims that men are better suited for combat roles than women due to their physical differences. This is evidenced by the US Army's recent decision to consider reversing gender neutral physical tests because women were overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. Additionally, mixed gender teams in close combat roles could have far reaching and grave consequences, according to the Ministry of Defence. Furthermore, the Israeli Defence Force has said that less than 4 percent of women are in combat positions and that they are concentrated in combat-support. Finally, women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men, and as such are likely to be less consistent and dependable than their male counterparts in tough situations."

Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..

The debate is about whether we should subsidize space exploration or not. Those opposing this idea have several points of argument. Firstly, they argue that space exploration can be carried out by the private sector. This is evidenced by the partnership between NASA and several for-profit companies, like Virgin Galactic and SpaceX. Secondly, space exploration is expensive and the money spent could be put to better use. Thirdly, it is ineffective, as it produces a large amount of pollution. Lastly, there are more important issues to fund than space exploration. Evidence for this is that the annual budget for NASA could provide 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, 1.87 million people with health care, or fund NASA for one year."

Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..

As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: space exploration, investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches of the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity..
","
In this debate, we discuss the topic, “We should subsidize space exploration.” The supporters of this argument posit that space exploration can lead to colonizing the resources/lands of other planets, improve science and technology, be financially beneficial, necessary for the future survival of humanity, and unravel information about the universe. As evidence, it was stated that colonizing our solar system would need a broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties. Furthermore, space exploration after Gagarin’s 1961 flight, facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science. Satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040. We will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. Additionally, space exploration can lead to increasing knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity. Therefore, it is suggested that space exploration should be subsidized."
We should subsidize vocational education,-1.0,gpt3,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize vocational education', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:

- claim_3: subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The study analyzed the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany and found that the subsidies led to an increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs. This suggests that subsidies for vocational education can influence student choice and lead to an influx in those fields..
- claim_4: vocational education is not a good career choice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:

The debate topic is 'We should subsidize vocational education'. The affirmative side argues that subsidizing vocational education provides access to opportunities for the workforce, helps to fill in-demand roles in the economy, and leads to better outcomes for workers. The opponents of this idea argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes, is expensive, leads to an influx in those professions, and is not a good career choice. 

Evidence supporting the opponents' arguments includes a report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 which found that subsidizing vocational education may have limited benefits for the economy, as many programs may not provide the skills and knowledge that workers need to succeed in the 21st century; a study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 which found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be limited by the ability to scale, as many programs may not have the resources or infrastructure to serve large numbers of students; a study which analyzed the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany and found that the subsidies led to an increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs; and a report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 which found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience. 

In conclusion, there are legitimate arguments against subsidizing vocational education. However, proponents of vocational education believe that the benefits of subsidizing these programs outweigh the risks, as access to these programs helps to create a more diverse and skilled workforce, and ultimately helps to create better outcomes for workers."

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 2: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
    - Evidence 2: In 2002, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide. This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
    - Evidence 2: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
","
This debate is on the topic of whether or not assisted suicide should be a criminal offence. Opponents of this stance argue that assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it, reduces suffering, grants people the freedom to choose to end their life, and can benefit the terminally ill. Evidence supporting these claims include the prominent organisations like ""Dignitas"" and the “Washington Death with Dignity Act” which recognize the concept of dignity in this situation. It is also stated that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts with due care and that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally. It is also noted that in some countries, such as the Netherlands, a law has been passed legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide and examples of terminally ill persons that have benefited from this are given."

    - Evidence 2: The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient..
- claim_2: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: In 1997, in the cases of Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it..
- claim_3: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
    - Evidence 2: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.

    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
    - Evidence 2: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..

In this debate, the opposition argues that homeschooling should not be banned. Their main points are that homeschooling can be the best option for exceptional, religious, ill, and disabled students; that it can be personalized to the child's pace/needs; that mainstream schools can have a lot of violence/bullying; that parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children; and that the home is a good learning environment. They provide evidence such as Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services provided to home-schooled students in Eastern York schools, the autonomy that homeschooling provides, the opportunity to personalize education to a child’s interests, needs, ability and learning style, and the deeper understanding of their children's education progress that parents can have. They also cite studies that report home-educated students are more mature than schooled peers. All of these points point to why banning homeschooling would be a detriment."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 2: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 2: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 2: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..

The debate topic is 'Homeschooling should be banned'. The supporters of this stance argue that homeschools cannot be regulated or standardized, and that mainstream schools are essential for developing social skills, of higher educational quality, and parents are not qualified to be teachers. Evidence in support of this stance includes stories such as Vyckie Garrison's, who was not able to provide her six school-age children with a quality education due to lack of regulation and depleted energy. Mainstream schools also offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward, experiences homeschooled children miss out on. Opponents of homeschooling, such as the National Education Association, argue that it should be banned in order to protect the social safety net for the most vulnerable population: children.

Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich has also warned that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view. Finally, homeschooling requires a lot of extra work and resources such as references, and checking for DBS certificates, which can be difficult for parents to provide. 

In conclusion, the supporters of banning homeschooling argue that it cannot be regulated or standardized, it deprives children of important social experiences, it is of lower educational quality than mainstream schools, and parents may not have the resources to adequately provide for their child's education. This debate is about protecting the most vulnerable section of the population: children."

- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
    - Evidence 2: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 2: The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that vaccination prevents 3.5–5 million deaths per year, and up to 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination.
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.

    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 2: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
    - Evidence 2: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
","
In summary, it can be argued that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory in order to protect both the children themselves and the greater public. Evidence has shown that child vaccinations are effective, saving lives and preventing the spread of diseases such as polio, measles, and pertussis. For example, since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease has been noted in those of less than two years of age. Additionally, according to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide, down from 350,000 cases in 1988 due to vaccination programs. Furthermore, cases such as a 2005 measles outbreak, attributed to one unvaccinated teenager, demonstrate the importance of making sure that communities have high enough herd immunity levels to prevent these viruses from spreading. Vaccines are also key in preventing childhood mortality from diseases such as smallpox and pertussis, which have already killed millions of people and have the potential to do so again. Therefore, it is essential that routine child vaccinations be made mandatory in order to protect the children and the general public."

    - Evidence 2: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
    - Evidence 2: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
    - Evidence 2: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..

This debate addresses the topic of whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. The opponents of this idea argue that social media regulation is not effective, as evidenced by the failure of legislation like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act to take effective action against companies such as Facebook and Google for their data-collection practices. They also argue that social media regulation harms privacy, with most U.S. adults feeling they have little or no control over how their personal information is used. Additionally, opponents contend that social media regulation harms freedom of speech and other democratic rights, as witnessed in Vietnam, and that government intervention in private companies can lead to excess bureaucracy and inefficiencies. Lastly, they argue that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government, citing examples such as dark advertisements targeting minority communities."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
    - Evidence 2: The European Union reached a deal on Saturday on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 2: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 2: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
","
The debate topic is ""Social media platforms should be regulated by the government"" which has a positive stance. The supporting claims are that social media regulation can protect younger audiences, combat fake news, be beneficial to society at large, help to deal with negative content, and is necessary to deal with malicious users. To support these claims, evidence was presented such as the statement from the British government that it must act to protect young people online, the death of a young British teenager due to distressing content, the low percentage of Republicans who believe the media report the news accurately, the European Union's legislation to combat misinformation, the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act in the European Union to make social media platforms more transparent, and the 60 million cases of unauthorized access to social media accounts in 2011. Thus, the debate concludes that social media platforms should be regulated by the government to protect younger audiences, combat fake news, benefit society at large, help to deal with negative content, and deal with malicious users."

- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
    - Evidence 2: The 2020 presidential election further highlighted these deep-seated divides. Supporters of Biden and Donald Trump believe the differences between them are about more than just politics and policies..

    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
    - Evidence 2: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..
    - Evidence 2: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989.

    - Evidence 2: A range of scholars from at least the late 19th century to the present have produced arguments that white supremacy exists in U.S. school curriculum, oftentimes to the detriment of non-White students Americans' learning outcomes and the whole of American society..
","

In conclusion, the USA is not a good country to live in. This is evidenced by the unfair health and education policies, problematic and divisive political system, negative culture, high taxation and costs of living, inequality and poverty, insecurity and xenophobia. For instance, the study found that white teachers were more likely to give constructive feedback on essays if they believed the student who wrote it was white. Moreover, the ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people, veterans, and disabled. In addition, over 6,600 incidents of hate crime (including physical attacks on Asian elders) have been reported nationwide since the start of the pandemic. Finally, there is evidence that white supremacy exists in U.S. school curriculum to the detriment of non-White students and American society as a whole."

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 2: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 2: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 2: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
    - Evidence 2: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 2: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
    - Evidence 2: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
","
In the debate over whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned, opponents of the motion argue that celibacy allows priests to focus on God, as evidenced by the teachings of Paul VI and Origen that the increased solitude from family obligations can nurture a priest's spiritual life, as well as Paul's belief that any call to a life devoted to God will be aided by God's grace. Furthermore, they point out that celibacy has been part of religious traditions since the Church's beginnings, and that celibate priests are perceived to be more holy than those who are married. Additionally, they assert that priests have the choice to be celibate, citing the examples of Paul and the four German women who took the vow of celibacy, as well as the risk of sexually reckless behavior if the vow is removed, as suggested by the Archbishop of Vienna and the Catholic Church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia."

    - Evidence 2: George T. Dennis SJ of Catholic University of America says: 'There is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.'

    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..

The debate topic 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned' suggests that the traditional practice of priestly celibacy is outdated, too pressuring/difficult, unhealthy/unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Supporters of the topic provide evidence to support these claims, such as Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540), according to George T. Dennis SJ and Peter Fink SJ of Catholic University of America; the sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle according to Jimmy O'Brien; some of the nuns who returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy endured considerable hardship; celibacy is an unnatural act in nature; the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy caused depression in priestly figure Nouwen; in 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States; and Urbain Grandier is known to have had sexual relationships with a number of women and to have acquired a reputation as a philanderer. Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage and Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that celibacy is an outdated, pressuring/difficult, unnatural, and leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Thus, it is reasonable to argue that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
    - Evidence 2: Moreover, a 2010 CDC study on child well-being and family structure shows that children from homes with married parents did better in every category..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 2: But while cohabitation is on the rise, data from Pew and other sources continue to show that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships. The marriage happiness premium extends to nearly every aspect of a couple's relationship, with one notable exception: their sex lives..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 2: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult. About eight-in-ten married adults (78%) say they feel closer to their spouse than to any other adult in their life; a narrower majority of cohabiters (55%) say the same about their partner..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
    - Evidence 2: One of the most significant advantages of marriage is eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits. First, as a married couple, you're each eligible to collect your own Social Security benefit or up to 50 percent of your spouse's benefit, whichever is greater. This can be a financial plus if one of you is a higher earner..
","
In summary, this debate is discussing the proposition of 'We should abandon marriage'. Its opponents argue that marriage is beneficial for children, for people either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons, makes people happy, makes the couple closer, and provides important financial benefits. To support these claims, evidence has been provided such as showing that children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father, that when a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption it is one of life's greatest blessings, married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting, and that married couples are eligible for financial benefits such as lower tax brackets and Social Security benefits."

    - Evidence 1: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
    - Evidence 2: Millions of girls around the world experience female genital mutilation (FGM) as a prerequisite to marriage or as a means to control a woman’s sexuality before marriage. This is an infringement on a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy, and as it is often performed on school-aged girls, also stops them from being able to access education and deprives them of their childhood, as well as causing both short- and long-term health consequences..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 2: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","
In summary, the debate over the topic 'We should abandon marriage' is based on the claims that marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women; marriages are unstable; marriages tie up people with unfair obligations; and most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship. Evidence supporting these claims show that women are expected to be submissive to male family members and experience female genital mutilation (FGM); divorce rates have increased globally; women are required to have male guardian permission to marry and deemed “disobedient” if they do not obtain their husband’s permission; and a monogamous relationship provides greater stability and emotional security."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 2: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 2: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
    - Evidence 2: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
","
This debate addresses the issue of whether we should abandon the use of school uniforms. The opponents argue that school uniforms prevent children from expressing themselves, reduce bullying, create a sense of unity and discipline, and save money for families. Evidence includes a former student at Hershey High School, who wrote an opinion piece claiming uniforms do not silence voices, a survey of eighth graders that found they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways while wearing uniforms, research from the Department of Education showing that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, a Texas survey that found students in uniforms reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than those not in uniforms, a statement from a teacher that uniforms help to focus on academics and minimize disciplinary problems, and finally, a UK study that found the average school uniform costs parents significantly less than the average non-school outfit."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
    - Evidence 2: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 2: Based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
    - Evidence 2: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
    - Evidence 2: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
    - Evidence 2: This idea is supported by testimony from a 17-year-old student forced to wear uniforms. Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
","
In summary, the debate over whether schools should abandon the use of school uniform has been a long and contentious one. Supporters of the argument that we should abandon the use of school uniform claim that it can harm learning and creativity, as messages of conformity over creativity are sent to students, and that it also harms self-expression, as one study at Arizona State University found that students from schools without uniform policies had higher self-perceptions. Additionally, supporters point to the financial burden school uniforms can have on families, as well as the discomfort and sexism that can be associated with certain uniform designs. Finally, opponents also argue that school uniforms can increase conformity and limit individualism, which can have detrimental effects on developing individuals."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
    - Evidence 2: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
    - Evidence 2: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as deliberate and systematic .. extrajudicial killings, and has condemned them as crimes against humanity..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 2: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..

The debate is about the issue of abolishing capital punishment. The opponents of this argument suggest that capital punishment helps victims and their families achieve justice and closure; it is acceptable for cases of severe crimes; and it can prevent crimes from taking place. They cite evidence from Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina, Leslie Rutledge, Arkansas Attorney General, Tom Cotton, US Senator (R-AR), the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, David Muhlhausen, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, and Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd, professors of economics and law respectively, to support their claim. These pieces of evidence indicate that the death penalty provides justice and closure to victims and their families, and it can act as a deterrent to crimes and prevent them from taking place. As such, opponents of the argument are in favor of retaining capital punishment."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 2: In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime..
","
The debate topic is whether or not we should abolish capital punishment. Proponents of this stance argue that state-sanctioned killing is fundamentally wrong, as the death penalty system in the US is unfair and unjust and disproportionately impacts people of color and those with less resources. In addition, capital punishment is costly and diverts resources away from other cases. Furthermore, executions are irreversible and do not prevent crime. Studies show that the American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation's executions, while states without the death penalty have much lower rates. These facts support that capital punishment does not deter potential criminals. In light of these facts, it is clear that capital punishment should be abolished."

    - Evidence 2: Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) was a strong supporter of these committees, which aimed to further support the goals of the PRO-IP Act, centered upon protecting American intellectual property and in turn, protect innovation central to the U.S. economy and its job market..
- claim_2: Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Many economists believe that, in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced, because there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organisations to produce them.

    - Evidence 2: These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs..
","
Summary: The debate revolves around whether intellectual property rights should be abolished or not. Its opponents argue that intellectual property rights are necessary in order to incentivize creativity and innovation, protect investments in developing new products, and provide a fair reward for the efforts put in by creators and innovators. To support this argument, opponents have provided evidence such as the work of UPOV in codifying intellectual property, the US Senate Judiciary's aim to protect American intellectual property, the incentives provided by public opinion, Operation In Our Sites, and licensing terms of intellectual property."

A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
    - Evidence 2: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..

    - Evidence 2: Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote 'We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.'.
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
    - Evidence 2: 'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add..
- claim_3: Guns can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
    - Evidence 2: A June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that 'Almost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction.'.
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and “89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence.”.
","
Summary: This debate discusses the topic of abolishing the right to keep and bear arms. Supporters of the motion argue that banning guns would save lives, as a study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that the legal purchase of a handgun is associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death. Additionally, Harvard professor David Hemenway wrote that there is a correlation between gun availability and homicides. Supporters also suggest that gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence, referencing a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine which found that guns kept in the home are associated with an increased risk of homicide. The third argument is that guns can fall into the wrong hands, citing the Texas church shooting as an example. Finally, supporters cite accidental deaths, especially those under 25, as a key reason to abolish gun ownership. A study from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence found that states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Nationally, local authority budgets were cut by nearly a third from 2010 to 2018, according to the UK National Audit Office and the public health grant fell by £700m in real terms between 2014/15 and 2019/20, as revealed by a Health Foundation report. Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed..
    - Evidence 2: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,.
    - Evidence 2: In an excoriating 24-page report, which will be presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva next year, the eminent human rights lawyer Philip Alston said that in the UK 'poverty is a political choice'..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
    - Evidence 2: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
","
The topic of the debate is ""We should adopt an austerity regime"". This stance has been argued against by citing evidence that austerity cuts access to essential services, extends recessions, is unfair to citizens, results in lower growth and job creation. 

Evidence has shown that austerity cuts have led to a third of local authority budgets being cut from 2010 to 2018 and a £700m fall in public health grant between 2014 and 2019, according to the UK National Audit Office and the Health Foundation Report respectively. Additionally, analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has fallen by 44% in the same time frame.

Furthermore, austerity has been pointed out by many economists to have contractionary effects and exacerbate recessions, with examples in Argentina, Russia and Turkey. Furthermore, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights declared that poverty levels in the UK, the world's 5th largest economy, were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”.

The effects of austerity have also been detrimental to growth, with a disastrous effect on Greece's economy in particular, even though the country's deficit has decreased. Additionally, the lack of job creation due to austerity has been seen in countries like Greece and Spain, with unemployment rates of 25.6% and 22.9% respectively. 

In conclusion, evidence has been presented to argue against the stance that we should adopt an austerity regime, showing that it cuts access to essential services, extends recessions, is unfair to citizens, results in lower growth and job creation."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 2: For example, Canada in 1993-96, cut their fiscal deficit but maintained strong economic growth..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 2: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
    - Evidence 2: Countries use austerity measures to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. That's when creditors become concerned that the country will default on its debt. It occurs when the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is greater than 77%..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 2: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
","
The debate topic is whether we should adopt an austerity regime. Those who are in support of this have argued that it can improve economic measures, be important for the long term, increase stability, reduce deficits or pay debts, and is essential in economically troubled times. For example, Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in the past 12 months at Q1 2012 due to austerity measures. In 2012, the EU Commission also produced a report claiming that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. Similarly, Morocco was heavily indebted in the 1980s but implemented austerity measures which improved economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment. In addition, a World Bank study found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77%, it slows economic growth. Lastly, US President Warren G. Harding cut the federal budget by almost 50% and reduced taxes for all income groups in response to the recession in 1920-1921. These all provide evidence to support the claim that an austerity regime is an effective tool for dealing with economic issues."
We should adopt atheism,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: John Locke in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos..
    - Evidence 2: As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film The Golden Compass, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be watered down from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says denigrates Christianity and promotes atheism for kids, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief..
- claim_2: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..
","
This debate revolves around whether we should adopt atheism as a belief system. Opponents of atheism claim that it discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion, citing John Locke's argument that the denial of God's existence would lead to chaos and Bill Donohue's two-month boycott of The Golden Compass film as evidence. On the other hand, they argue that people should choose for themselves whether atheism should be adopted, with Richard Liddle's statement that there is no scientific proof either way being a supporting evidence. Additionally, the European Court of Human Rights has also found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion, which means that public authorities should provide alternative forms of affirmation that aren’t connected with religion."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: La Mettrie defended a purely pleasure-based view of the proper end of human life, and advocated atheism as the only means of liberating human beings from the various forms of oppression which stand in the way of human progress..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
","
In summary, the debate is about whether we should adopt atheism or not. The positive stance claims that atheism is beneficial, and that it should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists, religions are immoral, and science can adequately explain the universe. Supporting evidence includes Baggini's argument that atheists have an advantage in evaluating morality, La Mettrie's view that atheism is a means of liberating humans from oppression, Michael Scriven's statement that we need not have a proof of God's existence, and Chapman's argument that scientific naturalism perspective looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. Additionally, evidence suggests that followers of atheism and agnostics have more knowledge about religion than those of major faiths."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 2: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 2: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
","
In summary, the debate topic is ""We should adopt libertarianism"", and its opponents have argued that libertarianism harms economic growth, minorities and those who are worse off, is unjust/non-equal, removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services, and the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens. Evidence for these claims includes George Monbiot's article in The Guardian connecting libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock, Steven Teles and Brink Lindsey's The Captured Economy, Robert Nozick's position on slavery contracts, James P. Sterba's application of ought implies can to establish the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Joseph Stiglitz's market failures argument, Human Rights Watch's report on the importance of government protection of human rights, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report on government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In short, opponents of libertarianism argue that it does not provide sufficient economic growth, leads to inequality, and removes essential laws and infrastructure that protect citizens and the environment."
We should adopt libertarianism,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism increases economic growth.

    - Evidence 1: Sustainability advocates Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins posited in their book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
    - Evidence 2: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
","
In this debate, it is argued that we should adopt libertarianism. The proponents of the stance argue that libertarianism has a range of benefits, including increased economic growth, increased freedom in the political system, increased happiness and fulfilment, and increased individual freedoms and liberties. To support their arguments, they point to evidence such as the book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution (2000), which argues that elements of libertarianism and green politics can coalesce to produce economic and environmental benefits. Furthermore, they cite a study by the Cato Institute, which finds that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth. Libertarianism is also seen as increasing individual happiness, as it allows individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. Lastly, libertarianism increases individual freedoms and liberties, as libertarian thinkers like Sunstein and Thaler argue that people should be free to do what they like, and Rothbard defends the self-ownership principle, which he argues is both axiomatic and universal."

- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 2: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Pope John Paul II: These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself.
    - Evidence 2: The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning in 1997. The opinion states, the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
    - Evidence 2: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child..
    - Evidence 2: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
","
In summary, the debate of 'We should ban human cloning' has supporters on both sides. The positive supporters are in favor of banning human cloning due to a lack of understanding of the process, unethical/anti-religious implications, it being unnatural, and it being unsafe. Supporters argue that cloning is not understood enough yet, and that allowing it means treating children as pure projects of our will, in contrast to the natural process of procreation. They also point to the ethical and religious implications, such as Pope John Paul II’s opinion that techniques involving manipulation and destruction of human embryos are not morally acceptable. They further argue that cloning disrupts the familial order and is unnatural. Additionally, supporters point to the safety risks of cloning, including the risk of transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child, as well as the low success rate of cloning animals with many suffering from health problems and genetic abnormalities."

In conclusion, it is clear that private military companies should be banned due to their unethical and unlawful practices, lack of professionalism, potential conflicts of interest, focus on profit, and ability to solicit and prolong conflict. Evidence of their unethical and unlawful practices can be found in the United Nations 2004 report on child soldiers, the Congressional Research Service 2010 report on unlawful killings, Amnesty International's 2009 report on poorly trained personnel, Human Rights Watch's 2006 report on limited accountability, the Journal of Military Ethics 2009 study on conflicts of interest, and the International Affairs 2010 study on limited accountability. Furthermore, private military companies' tendency to prioritize profit over ethical and legal considerations, as highlighted by the Project on Government Oversight's 2008 report, and their potential to prolong and escalate conflict, as found in the Congressional Research Service 2009 report, further demonstrate why they should be banned."

","
The debate topic is 'We should ban the use of child actors'. It is argued that banning the use of child actors is necessary due to the adverse effects that come with such a profession. Evidence suggests that it can lead to a lack of education, exploitation, loss of childhood, stress, and long-term difficulties. Studies have shown that child actors often miss school or receive inadequate education, leading to a lack of basic skills and knowledge. They are at risk of labor violations, such as wage theft, and may even be at risk of human trafficking. Child actors are often exploited and exposed to unhealthy working conditions, leading to the loss of their childhood. They also often suffer from mental health issues such as depression and anxiety due to the pressure and stress associated with their work. Moreover, due to the stressful environment to which child actors are subjected, they may develop problems later in life."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 2: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
","
The debate on the topic 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp' presents opposing arguments. Supporters of the closure of the Guantanamo bay detention camp argue that it is necessary for upholding moral standards and protecting human rights, while opponents of the closure argue that it would harm national security, is better for prisoners than other options, and is essential for gaining intelligence. Evidence in support of the opponents' stance includes statistics of former detainees reengaging in terrorist activities, the high security level of the facility, and its importance as an intelligence center."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 2: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
    - Evidence 2: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
    - Evidence 2: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..

The debate is over the topic 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp'. This stance argues that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed due to the fact that the detainees have the right to trial in US courts as ruled in Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)], it harms the US image/reputation/institutions, it is a symbol of discrimination/injustice, it is expensive, personnel commit crimes against the prisoners and unjust treatment/tactics are used. All of these points demonstrate why the Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed."

(U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
    - Evidence 2: In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation's economic opportunities [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.

    - Evidence 1: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
    - Evidence 2: The National Organization for Women (NOW) stated the following in its article 'Talking About Affirmative Action,':'Affirmative Action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95% to 97% of the high-level corporate jobs. And that’s with affirmative action programs in place. Imagine how low figures would be without affirmative action.'.

    - Evidence 2: With privileged African Americans gaining professional upward mobility through affirmative action and equal opportunity sanctions in education and employment, the less-skilled, less-educated African Americans fall behind..
- claim_3: Affirmative action is not just.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..
    - Evidence 2: Affirmative action is peak performative activism, as it focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities..
- claim_4: Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Opponents,[REF] who sometimes say that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination', further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects in addition to failing to achieve its goals..
    - Evidence 2: Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticised as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger..
- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
    - Evidence 2: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..

The debate is about whether we should end affirmative action or not. Supporters of ending affirmative action argue that it diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Evidence provided for the first claim include statements that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of those it is intended to help, which makes it counter-productive. Evidence provided for the second claim includes Arizona's 2010 constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action and that privileged African Americans gain professional upward mobility through affirmative action and equal opportunity sanctions in education and employment, leaving less-skilled, less-educated African Americans behind. Evidence for the third claim includes that race-blind admission testing could allow Asian American students, with top test scores in the country, a place at prestigious universities, but they are marked down on ""personality trait"" testing instead. For the fourth claim, evidence is provided of opponents who state that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination' and that such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional. The fifth claim has evidence of Clint Bolick of the Goldwater Institute stating that race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help. Additionally, data from the University of Texas show a wide variance in SAT scores and high-school grade-point averages among different races. In conclusion, there is strong evidence to support the claim that we should end affirmative action."
We should end mandatory retirement,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end mandatory retirement', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: A mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the International Labour Organization in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people, as older workers are encouraged to leave the workforce and make room for younger workers..

The debate material presents the topic 'We should end mandatory retirement'. The stance is that opponents of the topic argue that a mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers. Evidence 1 from the International Labour Organization in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people, as older workers are encouraged to leave the workforce and make room for younger workers. Evidence 2 from the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that mandatory retirement ages can promote intergenerational equity, as younger workers are given more opportunities to enter the workforce and build their careers. Thus, it can be argued that the benefits of mandatory retirement age create opportunities for other workers, as it helps boost employment for young people and promote intergenerational equity."

    - Evidence 1: There is no mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers in the UK..
    - Evidence 2: As a successful businessman, Greene implemented innovative employment policies, barring mandatory retirement age, actively recruiting the differently abled, and providing profit sharing at his own manufacturing facility ..
- claim_2: A mandatory retirement age harms the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that mandatory retirement ages can impede workforce diversity, as older workers are forced to retire and leave the workforce, reducing the diversity of skills and experiences available in the workplace..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2009 found that mandatory retirement ages can decrease labor force participation, as older workers are forced to retire and leave the workforce..
- claim_3: A mandatory retirement is not fair/discriminatory.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can result in age discrimination, as older workers are forced to retire, regardless of their ability to continue working..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can disregard individual circumstances, such as health, financial status, and personal preferences, as older workers are forced to retire regardless of their personal circumstances..
- claim_4: A mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Evidence from Social Security Eligibility by Jonathan Gruber and David Wise, published in The American Economic Review, found that health declines after mandatory retirement, suggesting reduced quality of life..
    - Evidence 2: The Retirement Decision and the Economic Status of Older Workers by Richard Johnson, Jonathan Schwabish and Jennifer Topper, published in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, found that mandatory retirement leads to decreased economic well-being for those forced to retire..
- claim_5: We should let everyone retire when they are ready.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging, as older workers can continue to contribute to the workforce, using their skills and experience to benefit society..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the World Health Organization in 2013 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready can promote well-being, as it gives individuals greater control over their lives and allows them to pursue activities that bring them happiness and fulfillment..
","
The debate topic is 'We should end mandatory retirement.' Its supporters argue that a mandatory retirement age is not beneficial to either employees or society, as it decreases institutional knowledge, harms the economy, is not fair or equitable, reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, and should not be imposed on those who are ready to retire. Evidence provided includes a UK example of no mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers, as well as studies from the World Economic Forum, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, American Association of Retired Persons, International Labour Organization, and World Health Organization that provide evidence of the detriments of mandatory retirement, including decreased workforce diversity, labor force participation, age discrimination, decreased quality of life and well-being, and reduced economic well-being. Supporters argue that allowing people to retire when they are ready would support active aging, and give individuals greater control over their lives and allow them to pursue activities that bring them happiness and fulfillment."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..
","
This debate topic centers around the question of whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. The opponents of this motion argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence, providing evidence that deterrence has been a successful strategy in keeping peace for nearly 70 years, and that the invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. They further state that the possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them, as the West does not intervene in Ukraine and Moscow spares their territory. Therefore, the opponents of this motion assert that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 2: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 2: On 21 September 2022, Mr Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” of Russian citizens to serve in the war in Ukraine. He also accused NATO members of making statements about “the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia”. He threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory: In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff..
","
The debate topic is 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', with the positive stance arguing that these weapons can fall into the wrong hands and can provoke or escalate disastrous military action. Evidence to support these arguments includes recent propaganda from Isis which claims they could obtain nuclear weapons in the near future, showing that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare is not a top priority. Additionally, there is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons, and the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command, both of which could lead to catastrophic use of nuclear weapons. In support of the latter argument, it has been estimated that if a Soviet nuclear attack had occurred in the past, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets, resulting in 275 million deaths in Russia and China, as well as 100 million more in Eastern and Western European countries. Furthermore, in 2022, Russian President Mr Putin threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory, showing the potential for nuclear weapons to cause a disastrous military action. 

The arguments and evidence presented above demonstrate why we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons, which can fall into the wrong hands and provoke or escalate a disastrous military action."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives..
    - Evidence 2: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
    - Evidence 2: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
","
The debate on whether we should fight urbanization or not has been ongoing for some time. Opponents of this stance have argued that cities offer more opportunities, as migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives. It has also been argued that urbanization benefits the economy, with new government policies encouraging the privatization of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment. Additionally, it has been argued that urbanization benefits the environment, as it drives innovation, including green technologies, and also brings higher productivity due to its positive externalities and economies of scale. Ultimately, urbanization should be embraced as it has the potential to offer more opportunities, benefit the economy, and have a positive effect on the environment."
We should fight urbanization,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
    - Evidence 2: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: MÄori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid urbanisation and growing population have increased criminal activities in Bopal & Ghuma..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization are associated with a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (see also acid rain) and hydrogen sulfide, which may affect plant metabolism..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 2: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..
","
In summary, the debate material supports the idea that we should fight urbanization. The supporters of this position provide four arguments: restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically and socially; urbanization causes crime; urbanization harms the environment; and urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources. To support these claims, evidence from different regions is presented such as how Venezuela has an urbanization rate of more than 85% and how rapid urbanization in India and New Zealand has caused social issues, criminal activities, pollution, inadequate housing, and lack of educational facilities. These findings demonstrate that it is necessary to fight urbanization in order to protect people in rural areas, prevent crime, preserve the environment, and reduce strain on resources."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 2: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
    - Evidence 2: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..

The debate material discusses the topic of whether we should introduce compulsory voting. Opponents of this topic argue that abstention from a vote reflects one's preference, citizens have a right not to vote, and compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner. Evidence such as abstention being used to indicate mild disapproval, being a form of exercising one's right to vote, and compulsory voting being a form of compelled speech act, all support the opponents' claims that compulsory voting should not be introduced. Additionally, the evidence provided suggests that compulsory voting encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. Furthermore, it reduces the vote share of minor and extreme parties."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
","
In summary, the debate is about introducing compulsory voting. Its proponents argue that this would increase representation, as it has been observed that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote in voluntary voting, skewing the political system further. This will also cause more people to become interested in politics, as they will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote. Furthermore, it has been ruled by the European Court of Human Rights that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, and research shows that compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout."
We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke..
    - Evidence 2: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
    - Evidence 2: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 2: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..
","
This debate topic is 'We should legalize cannabis'. The proponents of this stance argue that legalization can have numerous economic, social, and health benefits. The opponents argue that legalizing cannabis can cause harm to the body, lead to an increase in lack-of-judgement and accidents, be a gateway-drug that leads to addiction, and get in the hands of underage teenagers and children. 

Evidence supporting the opponents' claims include a 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore which found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Dutch research has also shown that an increase of THC content increases the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers. Harry Anslinger's campaign in the 1930s claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. A more recent study found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent. Also, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has stated that repeated marijuana use can lead to addiction. Finally, in response to the UK government's opposition to cannabis reclassification, prime minister Gordon Brown said that in any way, if we find cannabis acceptable, we are sending the wrong message, particularly to vulnerable young teenagers. 

Therefore, opponents of legalizing cannabis have substantial evidence that legalization could lead to health risks, a rise in lack-of-judgement and accidents, addiction, and access to the drug by underage individuals."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 2: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
    - Evidence 2: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
","
The debate topic is 'We should legalize cannabis'. Proponents of this stance argue that alcohol and tobacco, two substances known to be more harmful, are already legal; legalization of cannabis would be financially beneficial; cannabis is safe and has pain-relieving properties; it could be regulated if it was legalized and lastly, legalizing cannabis would reduce black-market activity. Evidence supporting these claims includes a 2002 DAWN report indicating that more than half a million deaths a year are caused by legal drugs while marijuana is not linked to any deaths; the fact that MDMA and cannabis have been exaggerated in terms of health risks while legal substances, like alcohol and tobacco, pose a greater health risk than cocaine; a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit indicating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion; the fact that vaporizers can release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating the ingestion of carcinogens; a letter to the FDA's commissioner expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement regarding medical cannabis; British Crime Survey statistics indicating that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased after the drug was downgraded to class C; and lastly, the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana. Based on this evidence, it is clear that there are strong arguments in favor of legalizing cannabis."
We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
    - Evidence 2: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
    - Evidence 2: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
    - Evidence 2: Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men..
","
In conclusion, we can say that legalizing prostitution may lead to several unfavorable outcomes such as an increase in sexually transmitted diseases, immoral behaviors such as pimping, organized crime, and trafficking, and more violence against women. Evidence for these claims have been provided in the form of a survey conducted in Athens, reports of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, studies that showed the influx of organized crime and violence in the business, and reports of violence and exploitation against women. Ultimately, it is important to consider the potential consequences before legalizing prostitution."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 2: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 2: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 2: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 2: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
","
In summary, the argument to support the claim that 'We should legalize prostitution' is that it would boost the economy, increase sex workers' benefits such as health care and unionization, allow for the profession to be regulated, and make it safer for women. It is also seen as a valid choice for those over their own bodies, as studies have shown it to have become normalized and providing benefits such as greater disposable income and access to upwardly mobile social circles. Examples of this are seen in Seattle by David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard and in Amsterdam by their court and sheriff. Furthermore, in the Netherlands the police only interfered when public order was at stake and in China in the 1990s, following the success of prevention interventions in Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
    - Evidence 2: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
    - Evidence 2: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 2: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
","
The debate over whether or not we should legalize sex selection revolves around the effects that it has on gender imbalance, gender stereotypes, and abortion/infanticide. Opponents of the legalization of sex selection claim that it can lead to gender imbalance. This is evident in countries like China and India, where the gender ratios are becoming increasingly skewed due to the preference for boys over girls. Furthermore, they argue that sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases, as son preference is still seen in more traditional families. Lastly, opponents argue that sex selection will lead to abortions and even infanticide, as couples may choose to abort pregnancies when they find out it is a female child."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 2: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 2: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
","
Summary: 
The debate topic 'We should legalize sex selection' presents arguments for and against this topic. Supporters of legalizing sex selection argue that it is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of their child and it allows for better family planning, happiness, and the prevention of diseases and abortions. Evidence presented includes how parents often have a preference for the sex of their child, how gender selection helps prevent gender-specific diseases, and how it gives parents control over the number of children they want. It also helps prevent abortions and infanticide, especially in cases of gender-preference."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 2: Judge White did not go so far as to say that flag-burning is not constitutionally protected; rather, he wrote that without the benefit of the majority's thinking if it were to find flag burning protected by the First Amendment, I would sustain such a conviction..
","
In conclusion, the argument over whether flag burning should be prohibited is a difficult one. The opponents of prohibition argue that flag burning is a form of expression protected under the First Amendment, citing Supreme Court cases such as the 1984 decision in Texas v. Johnson and the 1989 decision in United States v. Eichman as evidence. They believe that the right to express oneself in this way should be upheld, and that any attempts to ban it would be unconstitutional. On the other hand, supporters of prohibition believe that flag burning is offensive and disrespectful, and that the government has a legitimate interest in protecting its symbol. Ultimately, it is up to the court to decide what is and isn't protected by the First Amendment."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Warren was of the opinion that laws against flag-burning are constitutional.
    - Evidence 2: By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag..
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
","
The debate topic is: 'We should prohibit flag burning'. The stance taken is in favour of the prohibition of flag burning. Supporters of this stance argue that flags are important symbols that should be respected, and that flag burning is an inflammatory act that deserves to be outlawed. Evidence supporting the claim that flags should be respected includes Warren's opinion that laws against flag burning are constitutional, and that by 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. As evidence that flag burning is an inflammatory act, it is pointed out that proponents of legislation argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture, and that in 2003, Khalid led a protest march that culminated with him burning the American flag. Therefore, it is argued that flag burning should be prohibited."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
    - Evidence 2: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 2: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 2: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 2: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
","
In summary, The opponents of the topic 'We should prohibit women in combat' argue that, due to the principle of equality between men and women enshrined in the European Treaties, women have been increasingly participating in economic activities, showing leadership and different skills and strategies that can make any infantry unit better. Studies also suggest that women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units and there are numerous examples of women serving in combat with extraordinary skill and courage. Furthermore, it has been shown that women can pass the same fitness tests as men and meet the standard in order to serve in combat roles. Ultimately, it should be up to the individual women if they choose to serve in combat."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
    - Evidence 2: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
    - Evidence 2: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
    - Evidence 2: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
    - Evidence 2: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
","
In summary, the topic of the debate is whether or not we should prohibit women in combat. Supporters of the topic argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women due to their physical size, strength and stamina. Women cannot overcome physical, emotional and mental barriers that combat roles require, as they lack the strength, speed, and aerobic capacity of the average man. Additionally, women in combat can be a distraction to men, or a harm to the function of the military, as emotions may be heightened and the performance of the men may suffer. Supporters also suggest that women should serve in safer roles, and cite the example of Queen Elizabeth II who served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service as a mechanic. Finally, female soldier capture is a big concern as women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men, and any captured women may be subject to rape."

The debate topic is ""We should subsidize journalism"". This debate opposes subsidizing journalism, and the claim is that government intervention has the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. Supporting this claim, evidence shows that political endorsements can create favoritism in reporting, leading to a conflict of interest. Additionally, the Church of Scientology has previously complained that subsidies provide a safe harbor for biased journalism. Therefore, it can be argued that subsidizing journalism poses a risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity, and should not be done."
We should subsidize journalism,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..
    - Evidence 2: Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting..
- claim_2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news..
    - Evidence 2: Further technological development within the world of the Internet points to a trend of increased usage of non-institutionalized, non-governmental, non-administrative and clearly transnational information during reporting and research work..
- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The IFJ launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative in 2008, a global campaign to defend standards and to raise awareness of the importance of quality journalism..
    - Evidence 2: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..

In the given debate topic, 'We should subsidize journalism', those who are in support of it claim that a subsidy is essential to make journalism viable as it has become increasingly difficult to filter the immense amount of information coming from the digital area. It is also necessary for information-spreading and accountability as it helps to produce a vast amount of factual reporting on state and national events. Moreover, providing subsidies to the media will also enhance the quality of journalism, as it will help create media-plural Europe which would better facilitate democratic decision-making and prevent the circulation of fake news. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) has also launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative to defend standards and raise awareness about the importance of quality journalism."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 2: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 2: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 2: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
","
This debate is about whether or not we should subsidize space exploration. Proponents argue that space exploration should be funded because private sector companies like SpaceX have been able to carry out successful space missions, while opponents point out that space exploration is expensive and ineffective, as well as the fact that there are other issues that need funding. Evidence has been provided for all arguments, such as SpaceX’s success in its missions, the costs associated with space travel, the ineffectiveness of previous space exploration, and the existence of more pressing issues that should be addressed. Ultimately, the decision whether to subsidize space exploration is up to society to decide."
We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
    - Evidence 2: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 2: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
    - Evidence 2: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
    - Evidence 2: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..
","
In conclusion, we should subsidize space exploration as it can help in colonizing other planets to provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for humans, as well as improve science and technology, create financial benefits, and unravel information about the universe. Space exploration can also help us develop technologies that can replicate and sustain life-giving essentials, such as water and air, off-world, and can help us harness a more sustainable world. Evidence for these claims includes the potential to supply clean energy, satellite imagery, climate data, and the data gathered from space missions which have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems."
We should subsidize vocational education,-1.0,gpt3,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize vocational education', Its opponents argue that:

    - Evidence 1: A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education can divert money from other important programs, such as early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the National Science Board in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education may not ensure quality, as many programs may not meet standards for curriculum, instruction, and assessment..
- claim_2: subsidizing vocational education is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Center for American Progress in 2018 found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be expensive, as many programs require significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be limited by the ability to scale, as many programs may not have the resources or infrastructure to serve large numbers of students..
- claim_3: subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The study found that a large-scale subsidy program for vocational education in Germany led to a significant increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs. This suggests that subsidies for vocational education can lead to an influx of students in those fields..
    - Evidence 2: The study analyzed the effects of a program in Germany that provided subsidies for vocational training and found that the program increased the demand for skilled workers in the relevant trades. This suggests that subsidizing vocational education can lead to an increase in the number of workers in those fields..
- claim_4: vocational education is not a good career choice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the National Center for Education and the Economy in 2014 found that many vocational education programs offer limited transferability of skills, making it difficult for workers to transition to new careers or industries, even when job opportunities change..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience..

In conclusion, the debate on whether or not we should subsidize vocational education is complex. Opponents of subsidizing vocational education claim that it can divert money from more worthy causes, is expensive, and can lead to an influx in those professions. Furthermore, they argue that vocational education is not a good career choice as it does not provide good transferability of skills and limited opportunities for advancement. Evidence for these claims include a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020, a study by the National Science Board in 2020, a report by the Center for American Progress in 2018, a study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020, and a report by the National Center for Education and the Economy in 2014.

This debate topic focuses on whether we should subsidize vocational education. Supporters of the topic argue that subsidizing vocational education can promote those with fewer resources, better fit many students, provide a good career choice, and benefit the entire market and society. Evidence supporting these claims include a 2019 study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium which found that subsidizing vocational education can improve workforce development, particularly for individuals who face barriers to employment; a 2018 report by the Center for American Progress which found that it can better align with local labor market needs; a 2020 study by Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce which found that it provides a more direct path to employment; a 2022 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics which found that there is high demand for skilled workers in various industries; and a 2020 report by the National Skills Coalition which found that vocational education provides hands-on, practical learning, has shorter time to employment, addresses workforce shortages, and can enhance social mobility. Therefore, subsidizing vocational education can have numerous benefits and should be supported."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
    - Evidence 2: Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 2: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying argue that if a person does not wish to take advantage of a change in the law which would allow for an assisted death then that is down to personal choice..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 2: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
","
In the debate about whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offence, the opponents argue that it gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it, reduces suffering, grants the freedom to choose to end one's life, and provides benefits to the terminally ill. They draw upon evidence that suggests that many Britons travel to Switzerland to end their life due to a lack of legal protection in the UK, and that allowing such a choice in the eyes of the law would provide safeguards for those who wish to take it. They also claim that physician-assisted suicide is ethically and legally allowed in certain places, and that death can be a preferable alternative to terminal sedation."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dr. Lynda Young, MD, stated her opposition when she said, 'Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'.
    - Evidence 2: The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient..
- claim_2: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
    - Evidence 2: Any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted of assisting suicide or attempting to do so..
- claim_3: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
    - Evidence 2: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
","
The debate topic is 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'. The positive supporters of this statement claim that it should be a criminal offence as it violates the doctor's role, people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others and people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. Supporting the first claim, Dr. Lynda Young, MD stated her opposition as she believes it is incompatible with the role of the physician as a healer. Furthermore, The State of New York has also enacted a prohibition to criminalise this act. The second claim is supported by The New Zealand Medical Association which is against voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide, as it is unethical. Any person found assisting suicide can be convicted of this offence. Lastly, for the third claim, Emanuel argued that the Netherlands studies have failed to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to non-voluntary euthanasia of the vulnerable. Additionally, the slippery slope argument states that the acceptance of these practices can lead to the acceptance of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable.  Therefore, assisted suicide should be considered a criminal offence."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
    - Evidence 2: Unschoolers cite studies which report that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers, and some believe this is a result of the wide range of people with which they have the opportunity to communicate..

Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 2: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 2: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..
","
This debate is about whether homeschooling should be banned or not. Supporters of banning homeschooling argue that it cannot be properly regulated or standardized, thus leading to potential abuse cases, while also depriving children from important social and educational experiences. The main argument against homeschooling is that public school is a better option for developing social skills and ensuring quality education since teachers are more qualified and have access to resources that parents don’t. Additionally, parents may not have the qualifications, time, or energy to effectively homeschool their children."

Additionally, the First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'. Therefore, it is argued that routine child vaccinations should not be mandatory, due to the potential dangers posed by the vaccinations, and due to the potential violations of basic rights."

- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
    - Evidence 2: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
    - Evidence 2: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
    - Evidence 2: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
    - Evidence 2: Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..
    - Evidence 2: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..
","
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. Supporters of this position cite the effectiveness of vaccinations in reducing the spread of diseases and protecting the lives of children. For example, after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, studies showed a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those under two. Additionally, the measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths by 74%. Furthermore, herd immunity is necessary for preventing the spread of a disease, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunizations prevented 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths between 1994 and 2018. Vaccines have saved countless lives, and the risk of preventable diseases should not be allowed to resurface due to vaccine hesitancy."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Lack of enforcement of the European Union’s data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., has also cast a shadow over the new laws..
    - Evidence 2: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
    - Evidence 2: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
    - Evidence 2: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
    - Evidence 2: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
    - Evidence 2: Around the US 2016 election, Russian entities set up and promoted fake Pages on Facebook to influence public sentiment — essentially using social media as an information weapon..

The debate topic is: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government'. Proponents of this view argue that government regulation of social media can bring about greater consumer protection, privacy, and freedom of expression. In opposition, opponents of this stance cite claims such as ineffective enforcement of regulations, privacy harm, limitations on freedom of speech and expression, and possible abuses of power by the government. To support their arguments, evidence includes lack of enforcement of the European Union’s GDPR, a Pew Research Center survey that found 81% of the public feeling they have little control over their personal information, Reuters' report on Facebook's commitment to restrict Vietnamese content after their cybersecurity law, and examples of Russian entities using Facebook to influence public sentiment. Meanwhile, opponents of government intervention claim it can lead to disruptions, excess bureaucracy and inefficiency, and political abuses. Therefore, the debate on whether or not social media platforms should be regulated by the government is complex, as both sides have valid arguments and evidence to support their positions."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.
    - Evidence 2: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
    - Evidence 2: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'This proportionate new framework will ensure we don’t put unnecessary burdens on small businesses but give large digital businesses robust rules of the road to follow so we can seize the brilliance of modern technology to improve our lives.'.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
    - Evidence 2: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
    - Evidence 2: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..
","
In summary, this debate centers around the topic of social media platforms being regulated by the government, with the affirmative side arguing that such regulation will protect the younger audiences, prevent the spread of fake news, be beneficial to society, help deal with negative content, and protect users from malicious activity. The affirmative side presented evidence such as statements by British MP Alex Lamb and Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of Safe To Net, along with an example of Russian interference in the US presidential election and the unauthorized access to social network accounts in 2011. This evidence strongly suggests that social media platforms should be regulated by the government."

- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In their study of polarization across nations, Thomas Carothers and Andrew O’Donohue argue that polarization runs particularly deep in the U.S. in part because American polarization is 'especially multifaceted.'.
    - Evidence 2: According to Carothers and O’Donohue, a “powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion renders America’s divisions unusually encompassing and profound..
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045). Simply living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, researchers suggest..
    - Evidence 2: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..

    - Evidence 2: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
    - Evidence 2: A country where, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 253 mass shootings in the country since the beginning of 2019. That’s more shootings than days. Two of those occurred over the weekend in less than 24 hours, first in El Paso, Texas followed by Dayton, Ohio, leaving 31 dead..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..
    - Evidence 2: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..

Summarizing, the opponents of the topic 'The USA is a good country to live in' have argued that the US has unfair health and education policies, a problematic and divisive political system, a negative culture, high taxation and cost of living, inequality and poverty, and is unsafe and xenophobic/racist. This is supported by evidence such as 8.1 million children under 18 years old were uninsured in 2007, 69% of people in households with annual incomes under $40,000 find it difficult to afford their health care costs, the US has an encompassing and profound polarization, living in the US is as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, almost half of Americans feel threatened by the cost of living, the US has a high Gini coefficient, 2.5 percent of wealth is owned by the bottom 50 percent, 11 percent of people view the US as safe, and middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites due to racialized trauma."

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
    - Evidence 2: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 2: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
","
The debate on whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned has sparked intense discussions due to its far-reaching implications. Those who oppose it point out that it allows priests to focus on God and enables them to remain close to Christ with an undivided heart while dedicating themselves to God and their neighbors. It is also argued that celibacy is a strong religious belief as it has been almost universally accepted since the secular clergy was recruited from among married men. Furthermore, the practice helps to cultivate the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world and makes priests to be perceived as holy. Those who support abandoning the vow point out that it is a matter of choice for priests and can lead to sexually reckless acts. To this end, a report in Australia suggested that obligatory celibacy may have contributed to abuse in some circumstances and the Archbishop of Vienna suggested that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of sex abuse scandals. Nevertheless, many people still believe that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, as it has been an obligation to observe perpetual continence since the coming of Christ."

    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..

The proponents of this stance argue that celibacy is outdated, too pressuring and difficult, unhealthy and unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behavior and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. To support these claims, evidence has been cited such as Lakeland's belief that celibacy should become optional and Egan's interview in which he stated that celibacy could be open to discussion. Elizabeth Abbott further points out that celibacy has failed in the past and leads to warped people, and Jimmy O'Brien points out that sexual chemistry makes it a difficult lifestyle. Moreover, it is argued that celibacy is unnatural in nature as all living organisms are meant to reproduce, and Ford argues that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced. Additionally, it is argued that celibacy is one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church, as Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests and Breitenbeck expressed his support for ending celibacy in order to address the priest shortage. From these claims and evidence, it is clear that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 2: Plenty of research indicates that healthy marriage positively impacts children and society. And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, it’s possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
    - Evidence 2: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 2: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 2: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..

Summary:
The debate topic is whether we should abandon marriage. Those opposing the abandonment of marriage argue that it is beneficial for children, important for people, emotionally satisfying, brings couples closer, and provides financial benefits. Evidence provided for these claims includes the fact that children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused, have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager, and that marriage positively impacts children and society. It is also argued that marriage is important for religious and traditional reasons, provides an example of unconditional love, makes people happier, and provides financial benefits."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
    - Evidence 2: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
    - Evidence 2: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 2: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
","
In today's debate, we will discuss the pros and cons of the topic: 'We should abandon marriage'. Proponents of abandoning marriage argue that marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women, that marriages are unstable, tie up people with unfair obligations and that most of the advantages of marriage can be achieved by a monogamous relationship. Evidence to support this includes a growing body of evidence that shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men, an increase in divorce rates globally since the 1970s, and the treatment of wives in terms of marital laws and in marriage ceremonies. Moreover, advantages of a monogamous relationship such as fostering emotional intimacy and reducing the risk of STDs are also put forth."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
    - Evidence 2: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 2: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
    - Evidence 2: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..

In the debate about whether or not we should abandon the use of school uniform, the opponents of the motion have presented several arguments. Their first argument is that children can still express themselves using other means and as evidence, they provided the fact that fashion is not considered to be the free speech that the United States Constitution guarantees and a research by Andrea Dashiell which showed that 54% of eighth graders still felt they could express themselves despite the policy of school uniforms. Their second argument is that school uniform reduces bullying and this is supported by a research from the Schoolwear Association which showed that 83% of teachers believed school uniforms can prevent bullying, as well as the fact that poorer families who are not able to afford the latest clothing trends may become targets of bullies.

The third argument is that school uniforms create a sense of unity and equality and the evidence given is the definition of uniforms by Joseph and Alex, which states that uniforms are costumes that identify members of a group and the Texas survey which found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community” than those who wore standard dress. The fourth argument is that school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning and the evidence provided is the fact that uniforms take the focus away from their attire and peers’ opinions, helping them concentrate better on their classwork and a belief that uniforms make the classroom a more serious environment. The fifth argument is that school uniforms save costs and the evidence used is a national survey which found that 94% of those surveyed believe school uniforms are cost-effective and a UK study which found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05, compared to £113.00 for regular clothing."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
    - Evidence 2: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
    - Evidence 2: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
    - Evidence 2: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..

The topic of this debate is 'We should abandon the use of school uniform.' The supporters of this motion argue that school uniform is harming learning and creativity, stifling self-expression, excessively expensive, often uncomfortable or even sexist and is increasing conformity and harming individuality. To support their claims, evidence was cited from Senior Alyse Madsen, Ph.D. Tara Maginnis, Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, NBC News’ Today show, the First Amendment, research from the Children's Society, a GLSEN study, Laura Bates, and the Everyday Sexism Project.

In summary, it is argued that school uniforms should be abandoned due to its negative impacts. School uniforms restrict learning and creativity, constrain students' self-expression, are often unaffordable, uncomfortable or even sexist, and increase conformity instead of fostering individualism. This is evidenced by Senior Alyse Madsen, Ph.D. Tara Maginnis, Robyn Silverman, NBC News’ Today show, the First Amendment, the Children's Society, GLSEN study, Laura Bates, and the Everyday Sexism Project."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
    - Evidence 2: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
    - Evidence 2: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as deliberate and systematic .. extrajudicial killings, and has condemned them as crimes against humanity..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..

In the debate over whether or not we should abolish capital punishment, opponents of the death penalty argue that it provides closure for the victims and their families, is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, and serves as a deterrent to prevent other would-be criminals from committing similar offenses. They cite evidence such as statements from Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), and Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, as well as studies from Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, of Emory University, and Charles Stimson, JD, of the Heritage Foundation. All of this evidence clearly demonstrates that capital punishment serves a valuable purpose in protecting society by deterring crime and providing justice and closure to victims’ families."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
    - Evidence 2: In one occasion, Persian daily Neshat published an article which called for abolishing the death penalty, claiming that the capital punishment is no cure for maladies afflicting modern society..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
    - Evidence 2: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
","
Summarizing the debate material: The debate topic is 'We should abolish capital punishment'. Its supporters are claiming that state-sanctioned killing is wrong because the death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner, innocent people are too often sentenced to death, and it disproportionately harms the disenfranchised. Furthermore, it is irreversible, expensive and not an effective deterrent. Evidence was provided that in states without the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates and studies have shown that it is not an effective deterrent."

The opponents of the debate topic 'We should abolish intellectual property rights' argue that intellectual property rights incentivize creativity and innovation, incentivize investment in developing new products, protect against stealing and provide people or businesses with the right to be compensated for their efforts. Evidence provided includes theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivising the creation of new creative works, research showing a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and economic growth, copyright protecting intellectual property such as movies, music and television shows, and exclusive rights allowing owners of intellectual property to benefit financially from their creation.

Summary:
The debate topic is 'We should abolish intellectual property rights', and it is argued that these rights prevent the continuous improvement of a service/product, restrict access to important information/products, are unfair, harm creativity/innovation, waste money, and are ineffective. Evidence supporting these claims include that some critics of intellectual property point to it as a harm to the public interest; Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman argues that intellectual property should be rejected; Lateef Mtima expresses concern that users of copyrighted content could potentially be held criminally liable; the General Assembly recognized the urgent need to respect indigenous peoples' inherent rights; Roderick T. Long holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of freedom of speech and freedom of the press; Petra Moser has suggested that patent policies may discourage innovation; innovators are able to create freely in a free culture; getting protection for a product is expensive; monopoly creates social costs; Tucker did not believe in intellectual property rights; and the Electronic Frontier Foundation has noted that criminal law is poorly suited for regulation of intellectual property law."
We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Gun control is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates..
    - Evidence 2: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For today’s gun owners, the right to own guns nearly rivals other rights laid out in the U.S. Constitution in terms of its personal salience. About three-quarters of gun owners (74%) say this right is essential to their own sense of freedom..
    - Evidence 2: The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision. 'Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,' he said..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
    - Evidence 2: Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer..

In this debate, the topic is 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', and the argument is in favor of this stance. Supporters of this stance argue that banning guns would save lives, gun ownership leads to mass shootings and gun violence, guns can fall into the wrong hands, and guns lead to accidental deaths. Evidence supporting this includes that when Missouri repealed its permit law, gun-related killings increased by 25 percent, gun shops and dealers opening for business leads to an increase in killings, states with more guns have nine times more unintentional firearm injuries, and victims of unintentional shootings are three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm. All of this evidence suggests that abolishing the right to keep and bear arms could reduce the amount of deaths due to guns."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: “For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
    - Evidence 2: “Taking care of ‘at risk’ children is a mandatory concern. However, youth centres and outreach services are considered unessential and have been cut to the bone. Yet these are services that help prevent children becoming ‘at risk’ in the first place,” said Gray..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
    - Evidence 2: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
    - Evidence 2: I was 18 [and homeless] and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work. I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing – Tayah, west London..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
    - Evidence 2: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
    - Evidence 2: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..

Summary:
The opponents of the adoption of an austerity regime make five claims, with evidence to support them. Claim 1 is that austerity cuts access to essential services, and this is evidenced by a study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that showed “unprotected” areas facing an average annual cut of 0.4% per year, as well as lack of youth outreach services preventing children from becoming “at risk”. Claim 2 is that austerity extends recessions, as indicated by financial press and economists citing austerity policies as an explanation for slow recovery in European countries and potential for deeper and longer recessions. Claim 3 is that austerity is unfair to citizens, with IMF-required austerity being significantly associated with rising inequality and poverty levels. Claim 4 is that austerity results in lower growth, with the OECD average slowing from 5 to 2.5%, and pay growth halving across OECD countries in the post-crisis years compared to the pre-crisis years. Finally, claim 5 is that austerity results in lower job creation, evidenced by Alessandro Turrini’s finding that countries with stronger employment protection legislation are seeing more unemployment due to austerity, as well as World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation indicating higher unemployment and vulnerable employment positions for women due to austerity."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
    - Evidence 2: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
    - Evidence 2: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
    - Evidence 2: The budget deficit was 11% of GDP in 2009-10. It is now about 5.5% and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of UK predicts a surplus by the end of the decade..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..

In the debate over whether or not to adopt an austerity regime, those who are in favor of it make the case that it is important to reduce budget deficits, improve economic measures, and increase stability and is necessary in economically troubled times. Evidence from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina has demonstrated the benefits of 'expansionary austerity': fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'. Additionally, research from Arellano (2008) model simulations shows that cutting government consumption may raise the default premium in the short run. Austerity also improves the long-term economic performance of the economy by reducing wages and public expenditure, which helps to improve the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitate an export-led recovery. One example of successful austerity was in the United States between 1920 and 1921, in which President Warren G. Harding responded to an economic recession by cutting the federal budget by almost 50% and reducing tax rates. Lastly, austerity can help to reduce budget deficits and pay debts. The UK Chancellor, George Osborne, is aiming to achieve a budget surplus and rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade and the UK Office for Budget Responsibility predicted a surplus by the end of the decade."

- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..
    - Evidence 2: The report also criticized the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship; they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'..
- claim_2: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
","
The debate topic is ""We should adopt atheism"". Proponents of this stance argue that atheism is a valid philosophical belief and should be respected, while opponents claim that it discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion, and that people should be allowed to choose for themselves. In support of the opponents' argument, Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated that the State must support atheistic propaganda and imposed prison sentences for religious propaganda, and the Russian dictatorship has denounced religion and God as 'lies'. To counter this, freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs should be subject to reasonable limitations prescribed by law, as stated in international law. Moreover, it has been argued that whether one adopts atheism or not is ultimately a matter of choice with no scientific proof either way."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
    - Evidence 2: I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 2: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 2: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
    - Evidence 2: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
","
In summary, The debate is about the proposition 'We should adopt atheism'. Its positive supporters argue that atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it; that we cannot prove that God exists and hence, atheism should be adopted; religions are immoral and people should not follow them; and science can adequately explain the Universe. They point out that every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to confusion, while atheism allows for free thinking and privacy. In addition, Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. On the other hand, J.L. Schellenberg has developed an argument based on considerations that suggests that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world. Regarding the immorality of some religions, examples such as the Bible teaching how to treat slaves and Christianity setting unrealistic expectations and promoting violence are provided. Furthermore, Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is hostile to faith and argued that “anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done”. Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
    - Evidence 2: Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
    - Evidence 2: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.

In the given debate, the topic is 'We should adopt libertarianism'. Supporters of this argument claim that libertarianism promotes individual freedom and the efficient use of resources, while opponents contend that it is harmful to economic growth, minorities/those who are worse off, unjust/non-equal, and removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services. They cite evidence such as right-libertarians ignoring market failures, leading to monopolies and stifled innovation; Adam Smith's system of liberty being a network of restraints imposed by the government; the morality of requiring the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the poor's basic needs; the existence of market failures requiring government intervention to address; the failure of trickle-down theory to reduce income inequality; the lack of market-based solutions to address environmental problems; and the need for government protection of basic human rights. Overall, this debate brings up a number of concerns about the practical and moral implications of adopting libertarianism."
We should adopt libertarianism,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism increases economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
    - Evidence 2: James Shikwati (born 1970) is a Kenyan libertarian economist and Director of the Inter Region Economic Network who promotes freedom of trade as the driving solution to poverty in Africa..
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to freely associate with others, a libertarian system can promote greater cooperation, understanding, and social support. For example, sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters..
","
This debate is about whether we should adopt libertarianism or not. Proponents of libertarianism believe that it increases economic growth, increases freedom in the political system, increases happiness/fulfillment, and increases individual freedom/liberties. They point to evidence such as reduced taxation leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity, as advocated by Americans for Limited Government. Moreover, the protection of property rights, as argued by economist James Buchanan, is essential for ensuring individual freedom, as well as the protection of individual liberty which is the central goal of political systems, as argued by philosopher Robert Nozick. Furthermore, libertarians believe that allowing individuals to freely associate with others can promote greater cooperation and understanding, as argued by sociologist Robert Putnam, and that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests, as argued by philosopher Ayn Rand. Finally, they believe that self-ownership, as proposed by Murray Rothbard, is both axiomatic and universal and that they support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters."
We should ban human cloning,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Cloning can also be used to advance medical research in a number of different areas. For example, cloning can be used to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments for those diseases. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases..
    - Evidence 2: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. By creating human cells and tissues that are specific to an individual, researchers can better understand the effects of new treatments and drugs on human health. For example, a study by the National Institutes of Health found that human tissue cloning can help to reduce the need for animal testing..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is free of genetic diseases that are present in one of the parents. A study by the New England Journal of Medicine found that cloning can help to reduce the transmission of genetic diseases..
    - Evidence 2: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility.
- claim_3: Cloning promotes health.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of infertility and to develop new therapies to treat infertility. A study by the Fertility and Sterility journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the processes of reproduction..
    - Evidence 2: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of aging and to develop new therapies to slow or reverse the aging process. A study by the Aging Cell journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the process of aging..
- claim_4: Cloning promotes science/research.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, cloning can be used to study the genetic makeup of extinct species and to better understand the processes that led to their extinction. A study by the Journal of Evolutionary Biology found that cloning can help to better understand the process of evolution..
    - Evidence 2: For example, cloning can be used to produce genetically modified organisms that can be used for a range of applications, such as producing new medicines and improving agricultural production. A study by the Nature Biotechnology journal found that cloning can help to advance biotechnology..
","
The debate topic is: 'We should ban human cloning'. The stance of those who oppose this is that human cloning has a variety of positive applications in medicine, health, and research that would be forfeited by such a ban. This is evidenced by a variety of scientific studies, including studies from the Journal of the American Medical Association, National Institutes of Health, New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of Medical Ethics, Fertility and Sterility, Aging Cell, Journal of Evolutionary Biology, and Nature Biotechnology. These studies have shown that cloning can be used to replicate organs, advance medical research, reduce the use of animal testing, create a child who is free of genetic diseases, help couples struggling with infertility, study the genetic basis of infertility and aging, and produce genetically modified organisms for a range of applications. Therefore, those who oppose the ban on human cloning argue that it has a variety of positive applications and should not be banned."
We should ban human cloning,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2001, when Germany and France proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an international convention to ban reproductive human cloning, the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included Spain, Philippines, the United States, and Costa Rica, noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning..
    - Evidence 2: Hwang himself criticised the process, stating that it did not bring science any closer to human cloning and the complexities, coupled with the low success rate (one in 123), did not make it ethical to clone family pets..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
    - Evidence 2: The Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and saw the alleged clone baby as an aberration..
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report published by the Council of Europe in 2008 discussed the potential for abuse of cloning technology and recommended measures to ensure that cloning is used for medical purposes only..
    - Evidence 2: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
","
The debate topic is 'We should ban human cloning'. This proposition is supported by four claims, with evidence to back them up. Claim 1 argues that cloning is not understood enough and references Kass' writings on how it can lead to a society that is willing to ""rationalize away the abominable"" and treats children as mere projects of the will. Claim 2 argues that cloning is unethical and anti-religious, citing the Holy See's opposition to human cloning, as well as Hwang's criticism of the process. Claim 3 states that cloning is unnatural and references Richard McCormick's argument that it disrupts the familial order. Finally, Claim 4 argues that cloning is unsafe, pointing to a Council of Europe report which recommends measures to ensure it is used only for medical purposes, as well as a study published in Nature Reviews Genetics which reported a low success rate for cloning animals. For these reasons, we should ban human cloning."

Summary: 
The opponents of closing the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility argue that it is essential to national security, provides better conditions for prisoners than alternatives, and is the single greatest repository of intelligence for the War on Terror. As evidence, it has been reported that 17.5% of detainees released have since been re-engaged in terrorist activities, with high-value enemy combatants possessing knowledge of an imminent threat, direct involvement in planning terrorist action, and if released, would constitute a clear and continuing threat. Furthermore, Guantanamo Bay is a secure location away from population centers, compliant with the Geneva Convention, provides humane treatment and exceeds any maximum-security prison in the world. Lastly, intelligence was obtained from enhanced interrogation techniques of detainees at the facility which helped lead to the capture of Osama bin Laden."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 2: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 2: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher..
    - Evidence 2: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 2: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
    - Evidence 2: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld later approved interrogation techniques in Guantánamo that included sleep deprivation, stress positions, nudity, sensory deprivation and threatening detainees with dogs..
","
In conclusion, it is clear that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed. It has become a symbol of discrimination and injustice, is extremely costly to maintain, and is used to commit human rights abuses. Detainees have the right to trial in US courts, and its continued operation has harmed the US's image and reputation. All evidence points to the fact that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp must be closed to restore the rule of law and ensure justice for all."

    - Evidence 2: A prominent advocate of affirmative action, he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases-Grutter v Bollinger and Gratz v Bollinger-that upheld and clarified the importance of diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As historian Roger Wilkins has pointed out, Blacks have a 375-year history on this continent: 245 involving slavery, 100 involving legalized discrimination, and only 30 involving anything else (Wilkins, 1995). Jews and Asians, on the other hand, have immigrated to North America—often as doctors, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs, and so forth. Moreover, European Jews are able to function as part of the White majority. To expect Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians is to deny the historical and social reality that Black people face..
    - Evidence 2: The justification for affirmative action is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture,[REF] and to address existing discrimination [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals..
    - Evidence 2: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
","
In this debate, we are discussing the topic of whether we should end affirmative action. Opponents of this notion make three claims; that affirmative action boosts diversity, that it is necessary to compensate for the past, and that it reduces discrimination. Evidence used to support these claims include the APALC brief submitted in the Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin case, which stated that Asian students benefit from a diverse student body; Roger Wilkins' view that Blacks face a 375-year history of slavery, discrimination, and a lack of upward mobility; and two court cases, Wesolowski v. Saskatoon Catholic Teachers and Johnson v. Transportation Agency, which both upheld affirmative action plans to address existing discrimination. It is clear that affirmative action can help to increase diversity and reduce discrimination, as well as to compensate for past injustices."

Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..

- claim_2: Affirmative action is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With privileged African Americans gaining professional upward mobility through affirmative action and equal opportunity sanctions in education and employment, the less-skilled, less-educated African Americans fall behind..
    - Evidence 2: In 2010 Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107 [REF]..

    - Evidence 2: Hardin's last book The Ostrich Factor: Our Population Myopia (1999), a warning about the threat of overpopulation to the Earth's sustainable economic future, called for coercive constraints on 'unqualified reproductive rights' and argued that affirmative action is a form of racism..
- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
    - Evidence 2: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university..
","
In summary, the debate presented the topic that we should end affirmative action. The supporters of this stance argued that it diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, not just, perpetuates prejudice and reduces quality. Evidence presented to support these claims include that affirmative action is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students, privileged African Americans gaining professional upward mobility, a 2010 Arizona ban on government-sponsored affirmative action, Harvard University capping the number of admissions for Asian American students, Hardin's last book arguing that affirmative action is a form of racism, the University of Texas data showing the mean SAT scores and mean high-school grade-point averages varied widely by race, and almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education."

    - Evidence 2: As a successful businessman, Greene implemented innovative employment policies, barring mandatory retirement age, actively recruiting the differently abled, and providing profit sharing at his own manufacturing facility ..
- claim_2: A mandatory retirement age harms the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019 found that mandatory retirement ages can limit labor market flexibility, as older workers are forced to retire, reducing the flexibility of the workforce and limiting the ability of employers to respond to changing economic conditions..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can lead to an inefficient use of human capital, as older workers with valuable skills and experience are forced to retire..
- claim_3: A mandatory retirement is not fair/discriminatory.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that mandatory retirement ages can promote intergenerational inequity, as older workers are forced to retire, reducing the diversity of skills and experiences available in the workplace and limiting opportunities for intergenerational collaboration..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Harvard Business Review in 2017 found that mandatory retirement ages can decrease older workers' sense of purpose, as they are forced to retire, regardless of their desire to continue contributing to the workforce..
- claim_4: A mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The Impact of Mandatory Retirement on Social Connections and Loneliness by Linda George, published in The Gerontologist, found that mandatory retirement can lead to decreased social connections and increased feelings of loneliness, both of which can negatively impact quality of life..

","
In summary, we should end the mandatory retirement age as it decreases institutional knowledge, harms the economy, is not fair/discriminatory, reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire and should let everyone retire when they are ready. Evidence suggests that mandatory retirement ages can limit labor market flexibility, lead to an inefficient use of human capital, promote intergenerational inequity, decrease older workers' sense of purpose, lead to decreased social connections and increased feelings of loneliness, negatively impact quality of life, reduce the risk of poverty in old age, and support active aging."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..
","
Summary:
The topic under debate is whether or not we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Those against the abolition of nuclear weapons argue that they are essential for protection and deterrence. To back up this claim, they point to the success of the deterrence strategy, which has kept peace for nearly 70 years, and to the example of Ukraine, which is not protected by a nuclear umbrella and was therefore invaded, while countries with nuclear weapons remain safe from a major, frontal attack."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
    - Evidence 2: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
    - Evidence 2: David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack. Additionally, the fact that it happened so recently highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago..
","
Summary:
The debate focuses on whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. Supporters of the argument contend that nuclear weapons have the potential to fall into the wrong hands, citing as evidence Jonathan Herbach's observation that some nuclear materials have never been recovered and Ariel Conn's warning that no one can be trusted with nuclear weapons due to the potential of mental health issues. They also assert that nuclear weapons can provoke or escalate a disastrous military action, citing Anthony Aguirre's account of the Cuban Missile Crisis and David Stanley's experience of a potential ICBM launch due to a lost connection."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
    - Evidence 2: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
    - Evidence 2: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
","
The debate topic is 'We should fight urbanization'. The opponents of this debate argue that cities offer more opportunities, urbanization benefits the economy, and urbanization benefits the environment. Evidence supporting these claims include Japan's economic development in the 20th century, where migration from rural areas to metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education has characterized urbanization; investments in Sihanoukville, which lead to migration from rural areas due to growing economic opportunities; economic growth due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, and greater readiness to adapt; new government policies which encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, and the development of small-scale rural industries; and green technologies and higher productivity in urban areas due to positive externalities and economies of scale. Therefore, urbanization has many benefits which far outweigh the disadvantages."
We should fight urbanization,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..
    - Evidence 2: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: What is certain is that the crime rate certainly rose during the period of industrialisation, particularly in towns and cities..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid urbanisation and growing population have increased criminal activities in Bopal & Ghuma..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Surveys showed that urbanization and coastal development, especially from tourism and agricultural sectors, contributed to increased degradation of the marine environment in the area..
    - Evidence 2: A specific concern is urbanization, which affects water quality by increasing its load of metals and organic contaminants..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and good-quality touristic services, so the fast process of urbanization, had the consequence of irregular neighbourhoods..
    - Evidence 2: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
","
In this debate, the topic being discussed is 'We should fight urbanization'. Those in favour of this topic argue that restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically and socially, as evidenced by a protection of natural resources in India, and disinvestment and governmental neglect in Venezuela. Urbanization is also linked to an increase in crime, as observed in the industrialization period in towns and cities, and in Bopal and Ghuma in India. Furthermore, urbanization has caused environmental degradation in areas with coastal developments, and an increased load of metals and organic contaminants. Finally, urbanization has led to irregular neighbourhoods and inadequate housing, filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease, and a lack of access to educational facilities. Therefore, the evidence supports the stance that we should fight urbanization."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
    - Evidence 2: Citizens have the right to choose whether they want to vote. Compulsion is part of a slippery slope to totalitarianism..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..

Evidence to support these claims include Herbert Spencer noting that a person, regardless of whether they voted or abstained, consented to the rule of the winning candidate, Minchin stating that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of civil liberties, and research from political scientist, Haydon Manning, which suggests that compulsory voting often leads to the use of sensational and misleading advertising."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 2: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 2: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..
","
In this debate, we are discussing the issue of compulsory voting. Those in favour of introducing compulsory voting claim that it increases representation, encourages people to become more interested in politics and creates a sense of responsibility in citizens to exercise their right to vote. Evidence to support these claims includes the fact that compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters, not just those who choose to vote, and that it increases the legitimacy of elected representatives and the political education of the people. Additionally, in countries where voting is compulsory, it is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution that citizens must exercise, and it should be seen as an important right that should not be taken for granted."
We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the Board representative is quoted as having said that we might end up in the next 10 or 20 years with our psychiatric hospitals filled with people who have problems with cannabis, and that a recent study by the British Lung Foundation found smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes..
    - Evidence 2: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
    - Evidence 2: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs..
    - Evidence 2: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 2: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..
","
In this debate, the topic under discussion is whether we should legalize cannabis or not. Those who are against it have argued that cannabis harms the body, increases lack-of-judgement/accidents, is a gateway-drug/addictive and can get to the hands of underage teenagers/children. To support their claims, evidence has been presented, such as a recent study by the British Lung Foundation which found that smoking three cannabis joints causes the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes. Dutch research has also indicated that an increase in THC content increases the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers. Additionally, researchers have analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and have found that the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health has shown that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades. Furthermore, there are studies that suggest that early cannabis smokers are five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs, and NIDA claims that repeated use of cannabis could lead to addiction. Lastly, it has been suggested that legalizing cannabis could lead to increased use amongst teenagers, as seen in Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s, leading to more than twice the rate of marijuana use among the state's teens than the national average. Based on the arguments and evidence presented, it is clear that the potential risks and harms associated with cannabis should be taken seriously and legalization should not be encouraged."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
    - Evidence 2: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
    - Evidence 2: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
    - Evidence 2: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
","
In the debate, supporters of legalizing cannabis argued that alcohol and tobacco, which are legal, are actually more harmful than cannabis, making it hypocritical not to legalize the latter. They also cited the financial benefits that would come with legalizing cannabis, such as the reduction in law enforcement costs and increased tax revenues. Additionally, they highlighted the positive aspects of cannabis, such as its medicinal benefits and safety. Finally, supporters argued that decriminalizing cannabis would reduce the criminal activity that comes with its current illegal status. The evidence presented to support their stance included studies that show the comparative harm of cannabis versus alcohol and tobacco, as well as studies indicating that decriminalizing cannabis would reduce crime and lead to increased health benefits."
We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
    - Evidence 2: Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
    - Evidence 2: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence..
    - Evidence 2: A survey of female sex workers in Leeds, England, and Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland, revealed that 30% had been slapped, punched or kicked by a client while working, 13% had been beaten, 11% had been raped and 22% had experienced an attempted rape..

In this debate, we are discussing the topic 'We should legalize prostitution'. Those who oppose this stance argue that legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, increase immoral behaviour such as pimping/organized crime/trafficking, and increase violence against women. Evidence from Kenya shows that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs and registering prostitutes does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes. Research from Maxwell (2000) and other researchers have found substantial evidence that prostitution is linked to drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes. Further, research conducted by Giobbe (1993) and a survey of female sex workers in England and Scotland revealed evidence of physical and sexual violence."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
    - Evidence 2: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 2: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 2: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..
    - Evidence 2: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
","
In this debate, it is proposed that prostitution should be legalized. Supporters of the proposal make five claims, each of which is backed up with evidence. The first claim is that legalizing sex work boosts the economy, and evidence supporting this claim is provided in the form of the historical fact that one of the founders of Seattle supported prostitution, as well as the seventeenth-century court ruling in Amsterdam to permit brothels. The second claim is that it increases sex workers' benefits, with evidence provided in the form of the 2003 Ministry of Justice public discussion on the topic and ethnographic research which suggested it would improve the situation of women. The third claim is that it will allow regulation of those in the profession, with evidence provided in the form of Oscar Goodman's statement that it would generate revenue and provide a safer sex environment, as well as a Dutch survey from the 1990s which indicated a majority in favor of legalization. The fourth claim is that it will make the profession safer for women, supported by Chinese CDC intervention projects in the 1990s and a 2010 book on New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation. The final claim is that sex work is a valid choice over one's body, supported by statements from a former prostitute and a study of subjective well-being of prostitutes."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
    - Evidence 2: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
    - Evidence 2: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
    - Evidence 2: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
","
In the debate over whether we should legalize sex selection, opponents of the legalization of the practice claim that it can lead to gender imbalance, reaffirm gender stereotypes and biases, and create abortions and infanticide. Evidence to support these claims include the fact that today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world due to son preference, including gender-biased sex selection; that in China and India, the ratio of girls to boys is on the decline due to sex selection; that it can be seen as an ethical and moral violation to break the law of nature by interfering with the gender of the unborn child; that repeat abortions are more likely when sex-selective abortions are conducted; and that two doctors were not prosecuted for performing an abortion for the purpose of sex selection in Britain."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 2: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 2: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
","
Summary: In the debate on whether we should legalize sex selection, those in favor of the motion argued that it is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child, as it allows for better family planning, makes the family happier and complete, prevents diseases in the child, and will prevent abortions/infanticide. Proponents of the motion gave evidence such as selecting the gender of a baby in advance can be beneficial for family planning, gender selection gives parents effective control over the number of children they want, gender selection can be a very comforting option for parents who have lost a child, and reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
    - Evidence 2: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
    - Evidence 2: Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment..

Furthermore, Justice Brennan's opinion in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment, as well as the notion that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable was highlighted as supporting evidence."

The debate topic is whether or not we should prohibit flag burning. Supporters of the argument that flag burning should be prohibited believe that flags are important symbols that should be respected and that burning a flag is a very inflammatory act. Evidence to support the first claim includes the fact that women should be allowed to join the military and serve in combat units if they meet the same training standards as men, and that in Austria flag desecration is illegal under Â§248 Strafgesetzbuch. To support the second claim, evidence includes the ordinance in Hong Kong that states that burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling, or trampling a flag is considered flag desecration, and that those in favor of legislation to proscribe flag burning believe that it is a very offensive gesture."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
    - Evidence 2: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
    - Evidence 2: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 2: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 2: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
    - Evidence 2: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..

Evidence to support this includes that in health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and female life expectancy is higher, that gender equality prevents violence against women and girls, that modern warfare is becoming increasingly high-tech which makes physical strength less important, women recruit being less likely to become disciplinary problems, female soldiers showing great skill and courage in past wars, new physical fitness standards being objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, and female soldiers failing to pass the fitness tests not being allowed to serve in combat roles. It is clear that prohibiting women from combat is not the correct approach."

- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 2: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
    - Evidence 2: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
    - Evidence 2: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
    - Evidence 2: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
    - Evidence 2: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
","
In conclusion, the debate regarding whether women should be allowed in combat is a complex issue. Although there is evidence that women have the capacity to perform in the military, there are still several concerns that need to be addressed, such as physical differences, distractions, mental and emotional stress, and the risk of capture and abuse. Supporters of prohibiting women in combat argue that men are better suited to combat roles, as physical differences may still be a hindrance for women, and that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers, as well as being a distraction or harming the functioning of the military. Furthermore, it is argued that women should serve in safer roles, as there is a risk of capture and abuse if they are put in combat roles."

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..
    - Evidence 2: The IPD journalism program helps strengthen journalists' economic literacy and equips them to report and write about the major economic issues confronting developing economies..
","
This debate revolves around the topic 'We should subsidize journalism', and the stance taken is in support of the motion. The first argument is that a subsidy is essential to ensure the financial viability of media markets, and evidence of this is provided by how the news media lost a considerable percentage of their advertising revenues during the pandemic. Additionally, investigative journalism is suffering due to lack of resources and funding, as evidenced by Soldatov's argument that WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by investigative journalism. The second argument is that journalism is essential for the dissemination of information and accountability, and the 2011 report from the Oxford School for the Study of Journalism and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism provides evidence of how mainstream media is the lifeblood of topical social media conversations. Lastly, MacLean argues that education in journalism empowers members of the public to understand how media work. To support the claim that subsidies will increase the quality of journalism, evidence from the European Union is provided on how it encourages competition between powerful incumbents and the new entrants. Furthermore, the IPD journalism program helps strengthen journalists' economic literacy. Thus, it can be concluded that subsidies for journalism should be implemented as it is essential for the financial viability of media markets, for disseminating information and for accountability, and it also increases the quality of journalism."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 2: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
    - Evidence 2: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
    - Evidence 2: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..
    - Evidence 2: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
","
The debate on the topic, 'We should subsidize space exploration' has presented arguments both in favor and against the proposition. Proponents of space exploration argue that it can be achieved in partnership with the private sector, and that it has great potential for developing technology and inspiring innovation. Opponents, however, have raised objections that space exploration is expensive, ineffective and that there are more pressing issues that deserve to be funded. While both sides have presented evidence in support of their positions, ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide if they believe that space exploration is worth subsidizing."
We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,gpt3,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
    - Evidence 2: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
    - Evidence 2: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
    - Evidence 2: Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites – which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path – to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: space exploration, investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches of the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity..
    - Evidence 2: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..
","
In conclusion, Space exploration should be subsidized due to its potential to colonize the resources/lands of other planets, to improve science/technology, to be financially beneficial, to be necessary for the future survival of humanity, and to unravel information about the universe. Space exploration can help us colonize new lands, develop new technologies, increase economic growth, aid sustainability efforts, and gain a greater understanding of the universe. Evidence such as satellite broadband helping to drive down the cost of data and being capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions, can be used to support this claim."

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The study analyzed the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany and found that the subsidies led to an increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs. This suggests that subsidies for vocational education can influence student choice and lead to an influx in those fields..
    - Evidence 2: The study found that subsidies for vocational education in Germany led to a significant increase in employment in the relevant fields. This suggests that subsidizing vocational education can lead to an influx of workers in those professions..

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
    - Evidence 2: In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person's 'mental state is .. of paramount importance.'.
    - Evidence 3: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 4: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: .   They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 5: A qualitative study using narrative interviews was conducted throughout the UK. Results shows that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most people. Those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a right. Some had multiple reasons, including pain and anticipated pain, fear of indignity, loss of control and cognitive impairment. Those who did not want to be a burden also had other reasons for wanting euthanasia. Suicide was contemplated by a few, who would have preferred a change in the law to allow them to end their lives with medical help and in the company of family or friends..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient..
    - Evidence 2: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 3: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
    - Evidence 2: In 2002, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide. This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances..
    - Evidence 3: The use of Advanced Decisions can help significantly but they also believe that if a right to an Assisted Death is available then the very knowledge of this fact can alleviate many of the worries an individual might have..
    - Evidence 4: Those who witness others die are 'particularly convinced' that the law should be changed to allow assisted death..
    - Evidence 5: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A September 2010 Irish Times poll showed that a majority, 57% of adults, believed that doctor-assisted suicide should be legal for terminally ill patients who request it..
    - Evidence 2: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
    - Evidence 3: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 4: Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned..
    - Evidence 5: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
","
This debate is about the criminalization of assisted suicide, with opponents of the measure arguing that it gives dignity to the person who wishes to commit it, reduces suffering, allows people to choose to end their life, and that the terminally ill would benefit from it. As evidence, organizations such as Dignitas exist to provide assistance to those wanting assisted suicide, and there are legal acts such as the Washington Death with Dignity Act that serve to regulate it. Kevorkian also wrote that a person's mental state is of paramount importance when performing assisted suicides. In addition, campaigns such as Dignity in Dying strive to inform the public, educate legal and healthcare professionals, and lobby politicians to bring about change in the current laws. Finally, qualitative studies throughout the UK found that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide, as those who have witnessed others die are particularly convinced. In addition, legal cases such as the New Mexico Second District Judge ruling or Dutch laws legalizing euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, the use of Advanced Decisions, and the Irish Times poll all contribute to evidence of the need for assisted suicide. Thus, the opponents of criminalizing assisted suicide present strong evidence for why it should not be criminalized."

    - Evidence 3: In 1997, in the cases of Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it..
    - Evidence 4: In 1994, a suit was filed in New York claiming that the anti-assisted suicide statute was a violation of equal protection and liberty guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. This claim was rejected by the District Court on the basis that there is no right to assisted suicide given by the U.S. Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..

In the debate about whether or not assisted suicide should be a criminal offence, the positive supporters argue that it should. Firstly, assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit, which violates the rights of the individual and their autonomy, as well as allowing for abuse. Additionally, it should not be allowed as many times people can still get better if given the chance, and it violates the doctor's role as a healer. Furthermore, people do not have the right to self-harm or harm others, and those who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. Various cases have been presented to demonstrate this, such as the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that there is no constitutional right to assisted suicide, the case in New York claiming it as a violation of equal protection, and the New Zealand Medical Association’s stance that it is unethical. Ultimately, these arguments demonstrate why assisted suicide should be a criminal offence."

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 3: “Differentiation is what homeschooling is all about,” Sherry Bushnell told me. She and herhusband founded the National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, an internationalorganization that supports parents who educate special-needs children at home. They homeschool their sonJordan, a 13-year-old boy with Down's syndrome, along with his nine siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
    - Evidence 5: The efficiency of homeschooling – and the fact that you don’t have to follow the national curriculum or the typical timings of a school day – leaves you with time to spend broadening your child’s learning. You can make time for play, projects, real experiments, and the arts. Real-life skill building – including cooking, cleaning, volunteering, and learning to budget – could form a part of your school day. You could also choose to learn in different places, like museums, parks, and science centres..

In summary, opponents of the motion 'Homeschooling should be banned' argue that it is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional, religious, ill or disabled students, as it can be personalized to the child's pace or needs, while mainstream schools have a lot of violence or bullying. Furthermore, they believe parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children, as the home is a good learning environment. This is evidenced by Eastern York Schools providing special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services to homeschooled students, and Gallup polls indicating a shift in attitude from opposition to home education in the last two decades, in addition to research indicating that mainstream schools are not meeting SEN requirements. Furthermore, homeschooling is an option for families living in isolated rural locations or travelling abroad, and it gives the child the liberty to explore their own family's culture, and the opportunity to communicate with a wide range of people."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Unschooling contrasts with other forms of home education in that the student's education is not directed by a teacher and curriculum..
    - Evidence 2: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 3: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 4: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although we acknowledged in the advantages section that homeschooled children do still develop socially, they naturally lose some interaction by spending more time at home. They may be out of touch with their peers, have fewer friends, and have less experience interacting with people from different backgrounds. Their view of the world could be very narrow and biased. In the worst cases, they could be brought up to be intolerant and misinformed, with little knowledge of general societal values. This could disadvantage them in the future..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 3: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse..
    - Evidence 2: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 3: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 4: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..

Given the topic of 'Homeschooling should be banned', the positive stance is that homeschooling should be banned because it cannot be regulated or standardized, it fails to provide essential social skills, and is not of higher educational quality as mainstream schools. Evidence for these claims include the fact that unschooling does not have a teacher or curriculum, and in Nebraska it allowed families to get away with poor homeschooling; that mainstream schools provide important social experiences that homeschooled children miss out on, such as work experience, sports leagues, and recognition and reward; that a study of more than 700 children showed that those with higher social skills did better in life and had less chance of criminal behaviour; that the European Court of Human Rights upheld the ban in Germany as it is important for children to be exposed to community values and democratic values; and that teachers in mainstream schools are required to have education degrees and can provide a depth and breadth of learning that parents may not be able to provide. These points support the stance that homeschooling should be banned."

In the debate on the topic 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', the opponents argue that vaccinations are dangerous (as the CDC reports that the chickenpox vaccine can cause pneumonia and the flu vaccine can be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome) and that their side effects can be serious (e.g. Rotashield was pulled from the market after it was found to be associated with higher instances of intussusception). They also argue that mandatory vaccination violates basic human rights such as the right to freedom of religion and the right to bodily integrity as enshrined in the US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights respectively. Finally, they contend that routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy, as natural infection often provides better immunity than a series of vaccinations, according to Mayo Clinic."

    - Evidence 2: In the twentieth century, there were 16,316 deaths from polio and 29,004 deaths from smallpox yearly in the United States; in 2012 there were no reported cases of polio or smallpox..
    - Evidence 3: Diphtheria killed 21,053 people yearly, measles killed 530,217 people yearly, mumps killed 162,344 people yearly, rubella killed 47,745 people yearly, and Hib killed 20,000 people yearly in the twentieth century United States; by 2012 each of these diseases were decreased by 99% because of vaccinations..
    - Evidence 4: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
    - Evidence 5: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that vaccination prevents 3.5–5 million deaths per year, and up to 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination.
    - Evidence 2: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 3: According to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization, vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, which equates to roughly 285 children saved every hour..
    - Evidence 4: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..

- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 3: Those seeking to enforce compulsory vaccination argued that the public good overrode personal freedom, a view supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905, a landmark ruling which set a precedent for cases dealing with personal freedom and the public good..
    - Evidence 4: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
    - Evidence 5: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..

    - Evidence 2: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 3: As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant..
    - Evidence 4: Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries..
    - Evidence 5: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:

    - Evidence 3: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
    - Evidence 4: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..

The debate topic is 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory.' The positive side argues that it is necessary to make child vaccination mandatory in order to prevent preventable diseases and save lives. Evidence shows that routine vaccinations have been effective at preventing death from serious diseases. For example, since the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, there has been a 69% decrease in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age. In the twentieth century, deaths due to polio and smallpox were 16,316 and 29,004 in the United States respectively, but by 2012 each of these diseases had decreased by 99% because of vaccinations. WHO estimates that 3.5 to 5 million deaths are prevented annually by vaccinations and up to 1.5 million children die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination. Furthermore, when the rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur. This high rate of vaccination has been successful in eradicating diseases such as smallpox which had already killed an estimated 300 to 500 million people in the 20th century. Vaccination also helps protect others in the community, which was the focus of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905. Vaccine hesitancy has resulted in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases, making it all the more necessary for child vaccinations to be mandatory."

The FTC’s failure to act imperils not only privacy but democracy as well.'.
    - Evidence 2: TikTok paid a $5.7 million fine for violating the children’s privacy law in 2019. Nevertheless, TikTok failed to delete personal information previously collected from children and was still collecting kids’ personal information without notice to and consent of parents..
    - Evidence 3: Another California legislation, Senate Bill No. 1001, was signed into law last September and will go into effect in July. It purports to address the role of bots in fake news and advertising. But the law’s definition of “bot” is too broad, and the method it uses is a poor match for the goal it seeks to accomplish..

    - Evidence 2: Herbert Lin - Senior Research Scholar, Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University, said:' Government regulation to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation is neither desirable nor feasible. It is not desirable because any process developed to address the problem cannot be made immune to political co-optation. '.
    - Evidence 3: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..
    - Evidence 4: Around the US 2016 election, Russian entities set up and promoted fake Pages on Facebook to influence public sentiment — essentially using social media as an information weapon..
    - Evidence 5: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..

It is coarsening our political discourse, leading to polarization and division. It exposes vulnerable people to extremist ideology, driving them toward violence. Social media is addictive, can damage our body image and sense of self-worth..
    - Evidence 3: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 4: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
    - Evidence 5: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Along those lines, Senator Amy Klobuchar has proposed legislation to have the National Science Foundation identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material..
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
    - Evidence 3: Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'We will not allow child sexual abuse, terrorist material and other harmful content to fester on online platforms. Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.'.
    - Evidence 4: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 5: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The dramatic story of the consulting agency Cambridge Analytica is a case in point. The firm exploited the private information of over 50 million Facebook users to influence the 2016 American presidential election..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 3: Another rising concern, exacerbated by Cambridge Analytica’s breach of Facebook data, centers on how bad actors access private data from social media platforms and elsewhere and use it to manipulate opinions for the benefit of a few..
    - Evidence 4: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..
    - Evidence 5: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..

Topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government' 

Stance: Positive

The government should regulate social media platforms as it can protect the younger audiences, help deal with fake news, and aid in dealing with malicious users. Evidence supports this stance, such as Congress “sought to further First Amendment and e‑commerce interests on the Internet while also promoting the protection of minors”, EPIC and coalition of child advocacy, consumer, and privacy groups filed a complaint urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and penalize TikTok, companies are obligated to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health, the need for an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, transparency from platforms about content moderation decisions, a Gallup poll that found only 37 percent of people believing “news organizations generally get the facts straight”, fake content during the presidential campaign, the Chinese government taking full advantage of social media to release real-time pandemic information, legislation seeking to make social media platforms more transparent, the need to protect users from serious harm, the National Science Foundation to identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms, the Digital Services Act to require companies to more aggressively police their platforms, the dramatic story of the consulting agency Cambridge Analytica exploiting the private information of over 50 million Facebook users, the Pew Trust finding that 13 percent of Americans had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user, and the survey finding that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011."

- claim_1: The US has unfair health and education policies.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In another study, it was found that white teachers were more likely to give constructive feedback on essays if they believed the student who wrote it was white.

    - Evidence 4: In a recent opinion piece for The New York Times, Anne-Marie Slaughter laments the state of the current American workplace, which she considers toxic by nature..
    - Evidence 5: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another.

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
    - Evidence 2: As he accepted the Republican nomination for president, Donald Trump stated that “America is one of the highest-taxed countries in the world,” while promoting his tax cut proposal..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers estimate, for example, that 80 percent of families saw the share of budgets dedicated to spending on needs such as housing and health care increase by more than 7 percentage points between 1984 and 2014, potentially crowding out spending on other categories like leisure, longer-term investments in education, and saving for retirement..
    - Evidence 4: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
    - Evidence 5: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..

    - Evidence 4: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
    - Evidence 5: The United States’ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019—the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany—according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..

Summarizing the given debate material, it is clear that while the USA is often viewed as a good place to live, there are many concerns that must be addressed. The USA has been found to have unfair health and education policies, a problematic and divisive political system, a negative culture, high taxation and costs of living, inequality and poverty, and safety concerns due to the prevalence of gun violence and racism. Evidence supporting each claim has been presented and includes such findings as white teachers being more likely to give constructive feedback on essays if they believed the student who wrote it was white, a large proportion of Americans reporting difficulty affording health care costs, political divisions between the two parties intensifying, a culture of working ourselves to death, higher prices for prescription drugs and childcare, higher poverty rates for children, the top 10% of households controlling more of the total wealth than in the past, and increased incidents of hate crimes against Asian Americans since the pandemic began. These concerns must be addressed in order for the USA to be considered a good place to live."

Why? Individuals buy goods and services with dollars and cents — not the rates of change that economists, politicians, and pundits tend to focus on when it comes to growth. …By this metric, between 2016 and 2019, economic growth in the U.S. was the best in its class. …The U.S. surpasses…its peers…by no small margin.

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A leading participant in the Council, Eusebius of Caesarea, wrote: It is fitting that those in the priesthood and occupied in the service of God, should abstain after ordination from the intercourse of marriage..
    - Evidence 2: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
    - Evidence 3: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 4: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
    - Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gray held a series of councils in his diocese from 1241 to 1255 which endeavoured to enforce clerical celibacy, keep benefices from being inherited, and improve the education and morals of the clergy..
    - Evidence 2: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
    - Evidence 3: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 4: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption..
    - Evidence 5: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 3: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
    - Evidence 3: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..

    - Evidence 1: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
    - Evidence 2: Among the early Church statements on the topic of sexual continence and celibacy are the Directa and Cum in unum decretals of Pope Siricius (c. 385), which asserted that clerical sexual abstinence was an apostolic practice that must be followed by ministers of the church.
    - Evidence 3: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..

Summary: The debate is about the topic of abandoning the vow of celibacy for priests in the Catholic church. Opponents of the debate argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, is a strong religious belief, makes the priests to be perceived as holy, is a choice made by priests, and religious experiences and traditions should be maintained. They provide evidence to support these claims, such as the writings of Eusebius of Caesarea, Paul VI's encyclical on celibacy, and the Council of Carthage decreeing that bishops, priests, and deacons abstain from conjugal relations. Supporters of the debate argue that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, and provide evidence of this, such as the report released by the church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia and the statement from the Archbishop of Vienna."
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)..
    - Evidence 2: George T. Dennis SJ of Catholic University of America says: 'There is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.' Peter Fink SJ agrees, saying that underlying premises used in the book, Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy, 'would not stand up so comfortably to historical scrutiny'. Dennis says this book provides no evidence that celibacy had apostolic origins..
    - Evidence 3: In 1874 Old Catholics removed the requirement of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: From its beginnings, the idea of clerical celibacy has been contested in canon courts, in theology, and in religious practices..
    - Evidence 5: Perhaps the most striking example is that in most Eastern Catholic Churches, ordination of married men to the priesthood is routine (although no priest may marry after ordination, and only celibate priests may become bishops)..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent..
    - Evidence 2: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
    - Evidence 3: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Protestant apologists further argue that clerical celibacy violates the Biblical teaching in the First Epistle to Timothy:. The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
    - Evidence 3: Men are driven by testosterone to want sex, says John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University. Women are driven to a lesser degree by a mixture of testosterone and oestrogen, he explains. ’I'd regard celibacy as a totally abnormal state.’ Around 80-90% of men masturbate and it's likely that priests do too, he says. There is data to suggest that men who ejaculate more are less prone to prostate cancer, he says. You could argue that it's not so healthy to be celibate..
    - Evidence 4: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Many Carpatho-Rusyns, including Varzaly, believed clerical celibacy to be so inherently unnatural as to lead inevitably to promiscuity and sexual abuse..
    - Evidence 2: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
    - Evidence 3: Ignoring his vow of celibacy, Urbain Grandier is known to have had sexual relationships with a number of women and to have acquired a reputation as a philanderer..
    - Evidence 4: Christoph Sch√∂nborn and Hans K√ºng have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church..
    - Evidence 5: In the wake of the clergy sexual abuse scandals, some critics have charged that priestly celibacy was a contributing factor.
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
    - Evidence 2: In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy..

The topic for debate is 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned'. Supporters of the positive side argue that celibacy is outdated, too pressuring/difficult, unhealthy/unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Evidence presented in support of this argument includes Pope Paul III commuted the celibacy vow to one of conjugal fidelity in 1540; the lack of clear evidence of a general tradition or practice of celibacy before the 4th century; the removal of the requirement of clerical celibacy by Old Catholics in 1874; the contesting of the idea of celibacy from its beginnings; the routine ordination of married men to the priesthood in most Eastern Catholic Churches; records of nuns enduring hardship after the closure of the convent; the difficulty of suppressing urges and lack of someone to share life with; and the claims that celibacy violates Biblical teaching and causes depression. Furthermore, critics have argued that the pressure to remain celibate has led to promiscuity and sexual abuse, and prelate Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck proposed ending celibacy to address the priest shortage. Ultimately, celibacy is an unnatural act in nature, and all living organisms are meant to reproduce."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, a 2010 CDC study on child well-being and family structure shows that children from homes with married parents did better in every category..
    - Evidence 2: Research by the Institute for American Values shows that children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused, less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviors, have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager, and are less likely to be raised in poverty..
    - Evidence 3: Children raised in intact married families tend to earn higher grades than those in non-intact families.1) For example, kindergarten children from married families have higher reading scores than those from cohabiting families.2) Parents in always-intact married families are also more likely to help their children do their homework than are parents in stepfamilies or single-parent families,3) and fathers in always-intact married families are more involved in their children’s homework than are stepfathers.4) Compared with children in stable married families, students experiencing parental divorce have lower academic expectations and test scores.5).
    - Evidence 4: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 5: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization..
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church..
    - Evidence 3: Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually..
    - Evidence 4: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 5: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Evidence published by John Helliwell (and Shawn Grover) in the Journal of Happiness Studies finds that marriage makes people happier and that they continue to be more satisfied years into the marriage..
    - Evidence 2: Married people overall do better on virtually every indicator of health and well-being, says Robin Simon, a sociology professor and researcher at Wake Forest University. Even when they get sick, married people are more likely to recover..
    - Evidence 3: But while cohabitation is on the rise, data from Pew and other sources continue to show that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships. The marriage happiness premium extends to nearly every aspect of a couple's relationship, with one notable exception: their sex lives..
    - Evidence 4: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 5: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult. About eight-in-ten married adults (78%) say they feel closer to their spouse than to any other adult in their life; a narrower majority of cohabiters (55%) say the same about their partner..
    - Evidence 2: Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly..
    - Evidence 3: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult.
    - Evidence 4: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 5: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: One of the most significant advantages of marriage is eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits. First, as a married couple, you're each eligible to collect your own Social Security benefit or up to 50 percent of your spouse's benefit, whichever is greater. This can be a financial plus if one of you is a higher earner..
    - Evidence 2: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
    - Evidence 3: One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage..
    - Evidence 4: One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill..
    - Evidence 5: There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married..

The opponents of the motion, 'We should abandon marriage', argued that marriage benefits children, is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons, makes people happy, makes the couple closer, and provides important financial benefits. Evidence supporting these claims include studies showing that children from homes with married parents did better in every category, showed decreased risks of delinquent behaviors, a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are more likely to attend college, have higher reading scores, and are more likely to receive gender-specific support from having a mother and father. Furthermore, marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Moreover, married people overall do better on virtually every indicator of health and well-being, and married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting. In addition, married people enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships, including their sex lives. Furthermore, marriage provides important financial benefits such as eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits, income splitting, and tax advantages when transferring money and assets."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to CNN, dowry-related woman abuse in the country is often caused by dissatisfaction over the amount of dowry received, as it has become more of a condition of marriage, rather than a gift. Women are known to commit suicide, driven by the pressure of not being able to keep up with dowry payments, or they face violence within their marriage, or are murdered for the same reason..
    - Evidence 2: Millions of girls around the world experience female genital mutilation (FGM) as a prerequisite to marriage or as a means to control a woman’s sexuality before marriage. This is an infringement on a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy, and as it is often performed on school-aged girls, also stops them from being able to access education and deprives them of their childhood, as well as causing both short- and long-term health consequences..
    - Evidence 3: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
    - Evidence 4: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
    - Evidence 5: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Alison, for instance, found that her husband would go out with his friends at the weekend while she stayed at home, preparing lessons and doing the housework. Then there are factors that have the capacity to bring everything to a head. Money is one. “He’d say, ‘Well, you chose to have a low-paid job,’” Alison says. By then they’d had a (planned and wanted) baby, and children are another acknowledged marriage stressor. They bring high strain (in terms of finances, fatigue and housework) and often highlight different standards of care. “It wasn’t an easy time,” Alison says. “It reinforced just how different we were. Before, when we argued, I just thought, ‘Well, we’ll make up a few hours later.’ But when you’ve got a child, you don’t want to be falling out all the time..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 3: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
    - Evidence 4: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 3: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
    - Evidence 4: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 5: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","
The given debate topic is: 'We should abandon marriage'. This debate topic is supported by several claims and evidence. The first claim is that marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women, and supporting evidence for this claim includes CNN reporting on dowry-related abuse, female genital mutilation as a prerequisite to marriage, expectation that women be submissive to male family members, and that women often face unfair expectations and little reward when they enter a serious relationship. The second claim is that marriages are unstable, and evidence supporting this claim includes personal accounts of marriages not standing the test of time due to financial, parental and other stresses, UN statistics indicating a global increase in divorce rates, and research showing that many couples married before large rises in female employment expectations, leaving them in ill-suited marriages. The third claim is that marriages tie up people with unfair obligations, and supporting evidence for this includes laws requiring women to have male guardian permission to marry and criminal punishments for disobedience. Lastly, the fourth claim is that most of the advantages of marriage can be achieved by a monogamous relationship, and evidence supporting this claim includes the advantages of reduced risk for STDs, emotional intimacy, and having a partner that prioritizes time and personal investment. Overall, this debate suggests that marriage is often harmful and should be abandoned."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
    - Evidence 3: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to the long study and governments statistics gathered children are at higher risk if they “are perceived as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, wearing glasses or different clothing, being new to a school, or being unable to afford what kids consider 'cool.'.
    - Evidence 2: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 3: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
    - Evidence 4: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: B.R. international Public School shows that alongside featuring unity, uniforms likewise promote equality. Envision the circumstance without school uniforms. Students would show up in garments of their decision. Regardless of the amount we attempt, this will ingrain inequality- kids from rich foundations would wear their marked garments and adornments, while other students would build up a feeling of inadequacy..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 3: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
    - Evidence 4: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
    - Evidence 2: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
    - Evidence 3: In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result..
    - Evidence 4: One study showed that 70% of principals believed that mandated school uniforms reduced disciplinary problems at their schools..
    - Evidence 5: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
    - Evidence 3: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..

Summary:
This debate topic is 'We should abandon the use of school uniform'. Opponents of this topic argue that children can still express themselves using other means, school uniform reduces bullying, school uniforms create a sense of equality and unity, school uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning, and school uniforms saves costs. Evidence supporting the arguments includes examples of students expressing themselves, statistics from the Department of Education which found that uniforms reduce bullying, research on the sense of unity created by school uniforms, and research on how school uniforms save costs for families."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The people who make up the rules for uniform requirement have false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same. That sounds more like a post-apocalyptic society in which we are all forced to think the same and have no choices in our lives from the day we are born, similar to novels such as Anthem and Fahrenheit 451..
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
    - Evidence 3: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'.
    - Evidence 2: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 3: According to Dr. Alan Hilfer, child psychologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, this may lead to situations in which teenage students start resenting uniforms, undermining the whole purpose of the measure..
    - Evidence 4: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 5: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
    - Evidence 2: In a study of consumer costs of uniforms and whether money is actually saved, researchers found that uniforms do not replace kid's clothing, and parents actually ended up spending more money on clothes when uniforms are required..
    - Evidence 3: 95 percent of parents think school uniforms cost too much. About 16 percent said they’ve had to cut back on food and other essentials to pay for uniforms, and 13 percent said its pushed them into debt..
    - Evidence 4: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, many types of clothes popular among female students (especially during hot weather) are considered to be “sexually suggestive” (“School dress codes,” 2017, para. 7). According to the proponents of such rules for teenage girls, short skirts and similar clothes contribute to sexual crime in schools (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 2: Dr Johanna Reidy from Otago’s Department of Public Health says girls are forced to wear uniforms that stop them from being active during breaks or cycling to school..
    - Evidence 3: A researcher from the University of Otago says a radical redesign of uniforms is needed.  Students are often made to wear school uniforms that leave them too hot in summer, too cold in winter and are physically restrictive for girls..
    - Evidence 4: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
    - Evidence 5: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: This idea is supported by testimony from a 17-year-old student forced to wear uniforms. Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
    - Evidence 2: According to Grace Chen of the Public School Review, forced conformity may leave students ill prepared to enter the adult world where appearance matters even if uniforms are not required..
    - Evidence 3: 'School uniforms only reinforce the notion that authority and obedience matter most, which does not factor into dressing appropriately for a job in an adult career field' contends Scott Key of Fresno State University..
    - Evidence 4: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
    - Evidence 5: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..

Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', this debate affirms that school uniforms are detrimental to students' learning, creativity, self-expression, and individuality. Proponents of this stance present evidence that rules for uniform requirement promote an environment of false beliefs that lack creativity and conformism. This is evidenced by the opinion of Senior Alyse Madsen who said ""Strict dress codes infringe on a student's self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity"" as well as Dr. Alan Hilfer's statement that this situation leads to students resenting uniforms. Furthermore, school uniforms are expensive, often uncomfortable, and sexist as exemplified by 95% of parents believing uniforms are too expensive and a research from the Children's Society finding the average cost of a school uniform is now £340. Moreover, school uniforms are oppressive to individuality as many types of clothes popular among female students are considered to be “sexually suggestive” and restrictive for girls. Additionally, an adolescent's transition into adulthood may be delayed as uniforms fail to equip students with the knowledge of how to make appropriate choices as adults. Ultimately, this debate material affirms that abandoning the use of school uniforms is beneficial to students as it encourages independent thinking, creativity, and self-expression."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
    - Evidence 2: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bolte was a proponent of using capital punishment as a deterrent against violent crime..
    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
    - Evidence 3: Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals..
    - Evidence 4: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 5: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..

We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Amnesty International, the death penalty is the ultimate, irreversible denial of human rights..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
    - Evidence 3: In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of people with mental retardation in Atkins v. Virginia, ruling that the practice constitutes cruel and unusual punishment..
    - Evidence 4: Execution is the ultimate, irrevocable punishment: the risk of executing an innocent person can never be eliminated. And such mistakes cannot be unmade. Since 1976, 143 US death row prisoners have been exonerated completely for their crimes..
    - Evidence 5: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In one occasion, Persian daily Neshat published an article which called for abolishing the death penalty, claiming that the capital punishment is no cure for maladies afflicting modern society..
    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
    - Evidence 3: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime..
    - Evidence 2: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 3: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
    - Evidence 4: Nick Petersen, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Miami, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: Social science research does not support the contention that the death penalty deters crime. In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that “available studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.” A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion. Citing a number of problems with deterrence research, the council reported that “claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgments about capital punishment..
    - Evidence 5: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
","
In summary, the debate is about abolishing capital punishment. Supporters of the argument state that state-sanctioned killing is principally wrong, since it is the ultimate, irreversible denial of human rights and carries a high risk of executing an innocent person. They further argue that the death penalty harms the disenfranchised by being a waste of taxpayer funds and not being a deterrent for violent crime, and that it is irreversible since mistakes can never be unmade and it has been proven that states without the death penalty have lower murder rates."

    - Evidence 4: Some copyright scholars believe that, regardless of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created..
    - Evidence 5: The basic public policy rationale for the protection of intellectual property is that IP laws facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovation into the public domain for the common good, by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights to exploit their works and invention for a limited period..
- claim_2: Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sponsor Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) said, Millions of American jobs hang in the balance, and our efforts to protect America's intellectual property are critical to our economy's long-term success..
    - Evidence 2: According to the review intellectual property (IP) policy is an increasingly important tool for stimulating economic growth..
    - Evidence 3: Many economists believe that, in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced, because there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organisations to produce them.
    - Evidence 4: In relation to computer software, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) claimed in its 2011 piracy study: Public opinion continues to support intellectual property (IP) rights: Seven PC users in 10 support paying innovators to promote more technological advances...
    - Evidence 5: A joint research project of the WIPO and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth..

    - Evidence 2: Intellectual property rights (IPRs) - IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation)..
    - Evidence 3: By providing innovators with durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources, intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility..
    - Evidence 4: IP-intensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added (price minus material cost) per employee than non-IP-intensive industries.
    - Evidence 5: These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs..
","
In summary, it is proposed that we should abolish intellectual property rights. Opponents of this idea argue that intellectual property rights are essential for incentivizing creativity and innovation, which are fundamental in driving economic growth. Evidence from the WIPO treaty, the PRO-IP Act, UPOV and copyright scholars shows that IP laws facilitate the protection of innovations, providing creators with a tangible return on their investment of time and resources. Additionally, IP rights protect against stealing, with Operation In Our Sites, WIPO and the NIPRCC being key initiatives in ensuring that IP is protected. Ultimately, the right to intellectual property provides people and businesses with the chance to be compensated for their endeavours, thereby incentivizing the continued production of valuable works."

    - Evidence 1: Bhagwati asserts that intellectual property does not belong in the WTO, since protecting it is simply a matter of royalty collection [..] The matter was forced onto the WTO's agenda during the Uruguay Round by the pharmaceutical and software industries, even though this risked turning the WTO into a glorified collection agency..
    - Evidence 2: Boldrin and Levine argue that government does not ordinarily enforce monopolies for producers of other goods. This is because it is widely recognized that monopoly creates many social costs. Intellectual monopoly is no different in this respect..

In this debate, the topic is 'We should abolish intellectual property rights', with proponents for this stance arguing that it prevents the continuous improvement of a service/product, restricts access to important information/products, is unfair, harms creativity/innovation, wastes money, and is ineffective. To support these claims, evidence has been presented such as Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property hampering the development of photography in England, Murray Rothbard's argument that intellectual property laws can hinder innovation, Richard Stallman's opinion that the term intellectual property should be rejected altogether, the increased duration and scope of intellectual property rights, the risk of users being held criminally liable for uploading copyrighted content, Professor Lessig's analysis of the tension between piracy and property, the General Assembly's recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples, the iniquity of the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights, natural rights arguments for intellectual property being weak, the concept of intellectual property not being libertarian, government not ordinarily enforcing monopolies, the expense of getting protection, copyright being a legal fiction created by the state, intellectual property rights limiting physical property rights, and criminal law being poorly suited for regulation of intellectual property law."
We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Gun control is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws.  A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, a study was released that examined the effect of comprehensive background checks on the state. The study examined nearly two decades (1981-2000) of data and found that background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California..
    - Evidence 3: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
    - Evidence 4: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, 'The right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life'..
    - Evidence 2: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court struck down a New York law requiring parties interested in purchasing a handgun for the use of self-defense outside of the home to obtain a license because the law issued licenses on a “may-issue” rather than a “shall issue” basis. This “may issue” licensing method allowed state authorities to deny interested parties public use licenses for firearms if the interested party was unable to show “proper cause” as to why they have a heightened need for self-protection over the general population..
    - Evidence 4: In a 5-4 vote Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of individual Americans to keep and bear arms. The court said gun ownership is an individual right, not connected with military service, and that it can be regulated in some ways..
    - Evidence 5: The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision. 'Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,' he said..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment..
    - Evidence 3: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..

    - Evidence 2: Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, “the Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that ‘well-regulated’ militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to ‘insure domestic Tranquility’ and ‘provide for the common defence.'.
    - Evidence 3: Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama’s: 'every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.'.
    - Evidence 4: A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun..
    - Evidence 5: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..

Given the topic 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', the debate is focused on the pros and cons of this proposition. The opposition argues that gun control is ineffective, gun ownership is a right, gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sport-shooting and gun ownership promotes self-protection. To support these claims, evidence is provided to show that criminals overwhelmingly obtain firearms through illegal channels and that background checks have had no effect on homicide rates. Additionally, it is shown that assault weapons bans have no significant effect on murder rates, that most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and that the U.S. Supreme Court has proclaimed the right to possess firearms. It is also argued that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sport-shooting, and that it promotes self-protection. The evidence provided for this claim includes a Pew Research report which showed that 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% for target or sport shooting, data from 2016 that showed that 10 million people used firearms for hunting, and a Gallup survey which found that 63% of gun owners own a firearm for personal safety or protection. Overall, the evidence provided supports the opponents' claims and clearly demonstrates why abolishing the right to keep and bear arms is not the best solution."

    - Evidence 2: A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that firearms were the second leading cause of deaths for children, responsible for 15% of child deaths compared to 20% in motor vehicle crashes..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death”.
    - Evidence 4: Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote 'We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.'.
    - Evidence 5: When US gun ownership goes down, overall suicide rates drop; meanwhile, each 10 percentage-point increase in gun ownership is linked to a 26.9% increase in the youth suicide rate..
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, 'The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation.'.
    - Evidence 2: A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand.”.
    - Evidence 3: An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, “gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns.”.
    - Evidence 4: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
    - Evidence 5: 'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add..
- claim_3: Guns can fall into the wrong hands.

    - Evidence 2: Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were stolen from US homes during property crimes (including burglary and car theft), a yearly average of 232,400..
    - Evidence 3: Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, “with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft..
    - Evidence 4: According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who “used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence” obtained the gun from a family member or friend..
    - Evidence 5: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and “89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence.”.
    - Evidence 2: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2021, unintentional shooting deaths accounted for over 4% (2,007) of total gun related deaths (44,912) in the United States..
    - Evidence 4: A study from 2014 showed that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm..
    - Evidence 5: A 2001 study found that regardless of age, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns..

In the debate on whether we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms, those in favour of abolishing guns cite evidence showing that it would save lives. This includes statistics showing that firearms are a leading cause of death by homicide and suicide, as well as research showing that the legal purchase of a handgun is associated with an increased risk of violent death. Harvard professor David Hemenway also found that the more available guns are, the more homicides occur. This stance is further supported by evidence showing that gun ownership increases the risk of mass shootings and general gun violence, as the average gun owner is not trained to handle life-threatening situations, and that weapons are most often used in altercations that occur in the heat of the moment. Furthermore, the number of guns stolen during property crimes, as well as the number of guns found in the possession of state prison inmates, demonstrate that guns often fall into the wrong hands. Lastly, research shows that states with higher concentrations of guns have significantly more accidental gun deaths, and victims of these accidental shootings are more likely to live in households with a firearm. Overall, the evidence suggests that abolishing the right to keep and bear arms would lead to a decrease in firearm-related deaths, injuries and crimes."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Years of brutal cuts to public health services, following NHS reform legislation passed in 2012 which moved public health from the NHS to local authorities whose budgets were hit the hardest, had taken their toll..
    - Evidence 2: Nationally, local authority budgets were cut by nearly a third from 2010 to 2018, according to the UK National Audit Office and the public health grant fell by £700m in real terms between 2014/15 and 2019/20, as revealed by a Health Foundation report. Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed..
    - Evidence 3: As Sir Michael’s landmark report in February, 10 years on from the Marmot review of 2010, said: ‘From rising child poverty and the closure of children’s centres, to declines in education funding, an increase in precarious work and zero hours contracts, to a housing affordability crisis and a rise in homelessness, to people with insufficient money to lead a healthy life and resorting to food banks in large numbers, to ignored communities with poor conditions and little reason for hope… Austerity will cast a long shadow over the lives of the children born and growing up under its effects.’.
    - Evidence 4: The UK’s largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has documented a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. In that decade this food bank network went from distributing just under 26,000 parcels a year to handing out more than 1.33 million of them..
    - Evidence 5: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
    - Evidence 3: For instance, interest rates on Greek debt fell following its first bailout. However, the gains were limited to the government having decreased interest rate expenses. Although the private sector was unable to benefit, the major beneficiaries of lower rates are large corporations. Consumers benefited only marginally from lower rates, but the lack of sustainable economic growth kept borrowing at depressed levels despite the lower rates..
    - Evidence 4: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
    - Evidence 5: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In an excoriating 24-page report, which will be presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva next year, the eminent human rights lawyer Philip Alston said that in the UK 'poverty is a political choice'..
    - Evidence 2: Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,.
    - Evidence 3: Austerity Britain was in breach of four UN human rights agreements relating to women, children, disabled people and economic and social rights. “If you got a group of misogynists in a room and said how can we make this system work for men and not for women they would not have come up with too many ideas that are not already in place,” Philip Alston said..
    - Evidence 4: Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government should listen to the people being pushed into poverty by its policies. Universal credit is failing miserably, leaving families in debt, [in] rent arrears and at risk of becoming homeless. Three million children are growing up in poverty despite living in a working household..
    - Evidence 5: Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots – Denise Hunter, 57, at the West End food bank in Newcastle-on-Tyne.
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
    - Evidence 3: Because the evidence shows that austerity strangled the green shoots of economic recovery that were sprouting when the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition took office..
    - Evidence 4: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
    - Evidence 5: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers..
    - Evidence 2: Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%..
    - Evidence 3: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
    - Evidence 4: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
    - Evidence 5: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..

This debate is about whether we should adopt an austerity regime. Supporters of this regime argue that it can improve public finances, while its opponents point out that it would have numerous negative impacts, such as cutting access to essential services, exacerbating recessions, being unfair to citizens, resulting in lower growth and job creation. Evidence shows that austerity policies in countries such as Greece, Spain, Argentina, Russia, and Turkey had harmful consequences, from an increase in child poverty and closure of children's centers, to a rise in homelessness, to people resorting to food banks in large numbers, to increased unemployment, particularly among women. In conclusion, austerity policies are not a solution to economic problems and can have severe negative consequences."

    - Evidence 2: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 3: If budget deficits are not cut, it can lead to higher bond yields (e.g. in case of Greece, Spain and Ireland)..
    - Evidence 4: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
    - Evidence 5: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: If policymakers and the electorate show sufficient resolve, carrying through with austerity will eventually be rewarded by better financing conditions. Austerity pays off in the long run..
    - Evidence 4: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Astute monetary policy and falls in international commodity prices are given by a recent World Bank overview, as reasons for this relatively steady growth in the services and industrial sectors, enjoyed by Morocco and reflected in the country’s GDP..
    - Evidence 2: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 3: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
    - Evidence 4: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..

- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Countries use austerity measures to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. That's when creditors become concerned that the country will default on its debt. It occurs when the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is greater than 77%..
    - Evidence 2: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
    - Evidence 3: The Greek debt crisis led to a crisis in the eurozone. Many European banks had invested in Greek businesses and sovereign debt. Other countries, like Ireland, Portugal, and Italy, had also overspent. They took advantage of low-interest rates as eurozone members. The 2008 financial crisis hit these countries hard. As a result, they needed bailouts to keep from defaulting on their sovereign debt..
    - Evidence 4: Almost a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis, national debt in advanced economies remains near its highest level since World War II, averaging 104 percent of GDP. In Japan, the ratio is 240 percent and in Greece almost 185 percent. In Italy and Portugal, debt exceeds 120 percent of GDP. Without measures either to cut spending or increase revenue, the situation will only get worse..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Despite its negative reputation concerning its commitment to reforms and its implementation record, Greece has put forth an immense effort over the last three years and indeed has taken impressive steps toward achieving fiscal sustainability, with occasionally remarkable results. In the three years since the beginning of the crisis, it implemented a fiscal tightening of some 20% of GDP (around €50bn, while it has committed to measures cumulatively totalling €65bn by 2015) and reduced its budget deficit by an impressive nine percentage points, despite having lost a fifth of its GDP since 2009..
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.

Summary: 
The topic for the debate is 'We should adopt an austerity regime'. Supporters of austerity argue that it improves economic measures, is important in the long term, increases stability, and is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts. It is also seen as essential in economically troubled times. Evidence from countries such as Canada, Latvia, Estonia, Greece, and Morocco demonstrates that austerity is associated with economic expansion, improved long-term economic performance, cost competitiveness, and macroeconomic stability. Furthermore, the World Bank has stated that if the debt-to-GDP ratio is greater than 77%, it can slow economic growth, and the U.S. is a prime example of austerity leading to a successful recovery."

- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: John Locke in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos..
    - Evidence 2: As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film The Golden Compass, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be watered down from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says denigrates Christianity and promotes atheism for kids, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief..
    - Evidence 3: The report also criticized the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship; they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'..
    - Evidence 4: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..

    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..

In a debate over whether we should adopt atheism, the opposition has made three claims: first, that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion; second, that it lacks morality; and third, that people should be able to choose for themselves. The first claim has been supported with evidence including John Locke's views that atheism should not be tolerated, as well as numerous examples of religious discrimination, such as the boycott of The Golden Compass, criticism of atheism in Russia, and a ban on religious literature in Albania. The second claim is backed up by the views of evangelical theologian Douglas Wilson, who believes that belief is necessary to give a rational and coherent account of morality. Finally, the third claim is supported by evidence that individuals cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion, and that freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs should be subject only to certain limitations prescribed by law."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: La Mettrie defended a purely pleasure-based view of the proper end of human life, and advocated atheism as the only means of liberating human beings from the various forms of oppression which stand in the way of human progress..
    - Evidence 3: Being an atheists often comes with contradictory ideologies that the society thrusts upon people but on the inside, atheists are free of conflicting ideas. They do not need to debate almost every time some stranger comments or offends any religion for they not believe in religion. They do not ever get into heated debates about which religion is better than the other..
    - Evidence 4: They believe in scientific explanations and do not dwell on mythologies that are most of the time impossible to believe in unless you are a blind follower. Their reasons and concepts are clear and they are happy about whatever they believe to be true. Satisfaction at heart is the most important thing people seek and atheism brings it in the most literary and non-mythical way..
    - Evidence 5: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A few years ago, in a conversation with fellow atheist Peter Boghossian, Richard Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
    - Evidence 3: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 4: Theodore Drange (2006)  has developed an argument that if God were the sort of being that wanted humans to come to believe that he exists, then he could bring it about that far more of them would believe than currently do.  God would be able, he would want humans to believe, there is nothing that he would want more, and God would not be irrational.  So God would bring it about that people would believe.  In general, he could have brought it about that the evidence that people have is far more convincing than what they have.  He could have miraculously appeared to everyone in a fashion that was far more compelling than the miracles stories that we have.  It is not the case that all, nearly all, or even a majority of people believe, so there must not be a God of that sort..
    - Evidence 5: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
    - Evidence 3: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
    - Evidence 4: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
    - Evidence 3: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
    - Evidence 4: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.

In support of this stance, Evidence 1 is Baggini arguing that atheists are better able to make moral evaluations as they are not restricted by religious imperatives. Evidence 2 is La Mettrie advocating that atheists are liberated from oppressive forces that stand in the way of progress. Evidence 3 is that atheists are not constrained by conflicting ideologies imposed by society. Evidence 4 is that atheists seek satisfaction from factual explanations rather than mythologies.

We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Carson coined the pejorative term vulgar libertarianism, a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality..
    - Evidence 2: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 3: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
    - Evidence 4: The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others..
    - Evidence 5: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
    - Evidence 3: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good..
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
    - Evidence 3: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For Gustav Landauer, propaganda of the deed meant the creation of libertarian social forms and communities that would inspire others to transform society..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.

For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
    - Evidence 3: By allowing individuals to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist F.A. Hayek argues that property rights are essential for allowing individuals to act freely and pursue their own interests..
    - Evidence 4: By allowing individuals and businesses to freely compete, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Adam Smith argues that competition is essential for promoting economic growth and well-being..

    - Evidence 2: So why not prohibit alcohol .. I submit that there is only one why not, and this should be no news to libertarians who presumably believe in inalienable individual rights: namely, that no one has the right to coerce anyone not himself directly engaged in an overt act of aggression against rights..
    - Evidence 3: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
    - Evidence 4: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters..
","
In summary, Libertarianism has been proposed as an approach to increase economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness and fulfilment, as well as individual freedoms and liberties. Supporters of Libertarianism claim that it increases economic growth due to decreased taxation leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity. Furthermore, it increases freedom in the political system by protecting individual rights and property rights. Moreover, it increases happiness and fulfilment by allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives. Finally, it increases individual freedoms and liberties by allowing individuals to own and control property, and to take responsibility for their own lives."
We should ban human cloning,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
    - Evidence 3: Cloning can also be used to improve the quality of life for people with certain medical conditions. For example, cloning can be used to create replacement tissues for people with conditions like Parkinson's disease, which can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. A study by the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that transplantation of human stem cells can help to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease..
    - Evidence 4: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. By creating human cells and tissues that are specific to an individual, researchers can better understand the effects of new treatments and drugs on human health. For example, a study by the National Institutes of Health found that human tissue cloning can help to reduce the need for animal testing..
    - Evidence 5: Cloning can also be used to advance medical research in a number of different areas. For example, cloning can be used to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments for those diseases. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents claim that human reproductive cloning also would produce benefits.
    - Evidence 2: One of the main arguments for not banning human cloning is that cloning can help those who are struggling with infertility. According to the World Health Organization, infertility affects about 10% of couples of reproductive age worldwide..
    - Evidence 3: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility..
    - Evidence 4: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility.
    - Evidence 5: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is free of genetic diseases that are present in one of the parents. A study by the New England Journal of Medicine found that cloning can help to reduce the transmission of genetic diseases..
- claim_3: Cloning promotes health.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at Oregon State University, says, Some traditions and leading figures in conservative Protestantism who were opposed to human cloning for reproductive reasons have come to see that given the ambiguity about their own views about the status of embryonic life, and given the potential for health benefits, they could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning..
    - Evidence 2: For example, scientists could clone specific organs and use them to replace damaged or diseased organs in individuals. A study by the Lancet medical journal found that cloning could provide a source of organs for those in need of transplants..
    - Evidence 3: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic makeup of individuals with a particular disease and to develop therapies that target the underlying cause of the disease. A study by the Nature Genetics journal found that cloning could be used to develop gene therapies for a range of diseases..
    - Evidence 4: For example, scientists could use cloning to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases. A study by the Nature journal found that cloning could greatly advance stem cell research..
    - Evidence 5: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of infertility and to develop new therapies to treat infertility. A study by the Fertility and Sterility journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the processes of reproduction..

    - Evidence 1: New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 specifically permitted human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells, and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research in the state..
    - Evidence 2: On May 31, 1997, an issue of the popular science magazine New Scientist said that the International RaÃ«lian Movement was starting a company to fund the research and development of human cloning..
    - Evidence 3: For example, cloning can be used to study the development of embryos and to better understand the processes that occur during development. A study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help to advance medical science..
    - Evidence 4: For example, cloning can be used to study the genetic makeup of individuals with a particular disease and to develop new therapies to treat the disease. A study by the Journal of Medical Science found that cloning can help to develop new therapies for a range of diseases..
    - Evidence 5: For example, cloning can be used to produce genetically modified organisms that can be used for a range of applications, such as producing new medicines and improving agricultural production. A study by the Nature Biotechnology journal found that cloning can help to advance biotechnology..
","
In summary, the debate material centers on the topic of 'We should ban human cloning', with opponents arguing that cloning can be used for organ replication, to help those who can't otherwise have a child, to promote health, and to advance science and research. Evidence cited to support these claims includes a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, the ability to create customized organs that reduce the risk of rejection, the ability to improve the quality of life for those with medical conditions, the ability to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research, and the ability to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments. Furthermore, cloning can also help those struggling with infertility, provide a source of organs for those in need, help to study the genetic basis of infertility, and provide a source for stem cell research. Ultimately, cloning has a wide range of potential applications that could benefit society."
We should ban human cloning,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
    - Evidence 3: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning in 1997. The opinion states, the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited..
    - Evidence 2: The basis for this justification is that reproductive human cloning necessarily infringes notions of human dignity..
    - Evidence 3: Through the act of creating another human being, Christians have also posed the question as to whether this would be too much like playing God. Not only this, but some Christian ethicists argue that human cloning would create substantial issues of identity and individuality.This could be seen through the confusion of the child resulting from cloning as to who his parents are, what connection he has to his genetic duplicate, etc..
    - Evidence 4: The Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and its Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Being appear to ban SCNT of human beings. Of the Council's 45 member states, the Convention has been signed by 31 and ratified by 18. The Additional Protocol has been signed by 29 member nations and ratified by 14..
    - Evidence 5: Pope John Paul II: These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself.
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.

    - Evidence 2: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
    - Evidence 3: The Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and saw the alleged clone baby as an aberration..
    - Evidence 4: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..

    - Evidence 1: FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child..
    - Evidence 2: Scientists with experience in animal cloning have encountered low rates of success per implantation, where cloned fetuses are often malformed and dead before birth..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
    - Evidence 4: A study published in the journal Nature Biotechnology in 2005 found that cloning can result in genetic mutations that may cause long-term health problems and reduced lifespan..
    - Evidence 5: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2008 reported that cloning may result in unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences for the health of the cloned organism..
","
In conclusion, it is clear that human cloning should be banned due to a number of ethical, religious, unnatural, and safety-related concerns. The 1997 article in The New Republic by Kass, which discussed the wisdom of repugnance, articulated that repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. The National Council of Ethics of Portugal also published an opinion on the ethical implications of cloning which stated that it is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited. Furthermore, the Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and many religious ethicists have argued that it would create substantial issues of identity and individuality, as well as confusing the child resulting from cloning as to who his parents are. Additionally, cloning could result in long-term health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death, and can cause unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences. Therefore, for all these reasons, human cloning should be banned."

This debate focuses on whether we should ban private military companies. Those opposing the ban present four main arguments. The first is that private military companies can be financially beneficial, with evidence that they can result in cost savings for the government compared to using traditional military personnel, can provide more efficient services due to their quick response to changing circumstances, can provide access to specialized skills and expertise, and offer greater flexibility in terms of hiring and deploying personnel. The second argument is that private military companies are well-trained and better equipped, with evidence that they typically require their personnel to have high levels of training and experience, have access to state-of-the-art equipment, and invest in advanced technology. The third argument is that private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies cannot, or do not want, to do, with evidence that they have expertise in unconventional warfare and other specialized areas, can provide support services, and can carry out sensitive missions. The fourth and final argument is that private military companies can increase safety, with evidence that they can provide improved security in conflict zones, can provide more efficient use of resources, can carry out sensitive missions, and can provide support services."

Topic: We should ban private military companies
Stance: Positive 

Private military companies are controversial and have been accused of unethical and unlawful actions, as well as a lack of professionalism and loyalty to the hiring country. Furthermore, private military companies often prioritize profit over other considerations, potentially leading to a conflict of interest. Lastly, these companies may encourage conflict due to their financial incentives. 

Evidence supporting the claim that private military companies are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes includes a 2007 report by Human Rights Watch which found evidence of human rights violations committed by private military companies; a 2009 report by Amnesty International which found that the lack of accountability surrounding private military companies can lead to actions that violate human rights and commit crimes; a 2010 report by the Congressional Research Service which found evidence of unlawful killings committed by private military companies; a 2004 report by the United Nations which found evidence of private military companies using child soldiers in conflict zones; and a 2008 study published in the Journal of Business Ethics which found that private military companies can face a conflict of interest when serving both their client and the broader interests of society, leading to ethical violations.

Overall, these arguments and evidence support the position that private military companies should be banned. The actions of these companies have been documented to be unethical, unprofessional, and prioritize profit over other considerations. Furthermore, they can encourage conflict by offering their services to those who seek to engage in conflict. Thus, banning private military companies would be beneficial for the protection of human rights and prevention of conflict."

The topic of this debate is 'We should ban the use of child actors'. Those against the ban argue that acting may be the child's dream, as evidenced by research that suggests that parents can influence a child's career aspirations, that children can be inspired by celebrity culture, and that some children have natural talent for acting. They further suggest that child performers achieve success and confidence as seen in the example of Ashwin Chitale winning a best child artist award. Moreover, they argue that child performers are necessary for certain roles as demonstrated by research that shows that casting children in certain roles can contribute to character development, increase audience engagement, and increase diversity in casting. Additionally, they suggest that child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation, as child labor laws should be followed.

    - Evidence 4: Anissa Jones, of Family Affair fame, overdosed on August 28, 1976 at age 18.   Jonathan Brandis, who appeared in a number of films as a child and teenager, committed suicide in 2003 at the age of 27 due to reasons possibly related to his lack of continued success into adulthood..
    - Evidence 5: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
","
Given the topic 'We should ban the use of child actors', it is argued that child actors are vulnerable to exploitation and the loss of their childhood due to the lack of education, long working hours, lack of support, high levels of stress, and the pressure to perform. Studies have shown that these pressures can lead to developmental delays, emotional difficulties, social isolation, burnout, exhaustion, disinterest, physical abuse, and poor mental health, all of which can have long-term negative impacts on their well-being. Furthermore, child actors have a higher risk of facing problems later in life due to the stressful environment that they are subjected to. Thus, it is important to ban the use of child actors in order to protect them and ensure that they experience a healthy and safe childhood."

    - Evidence 1: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
    - Evidence 2: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..

Topic: We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp

Stance: Opposing

Summary: The opponents of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp have presented three claims: first, closing the camp would harm national security due to the fact that the remaining detainee population is composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorists, with 17.5% confirmed to have reengaged in terrorist or insurgent activities. Furthermore, these detainees meet the criteria of a ""high-value enemy combatant"" and would pose a clear and continuing threat if released. Second, the camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives, as it provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world. Third, the camp is essential to gain intelligence, having been designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241..
    - Evidence 3: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
    - Evidence 4: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
    - Evidence 2: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 3: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
    - Evidence 4: Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad..
    - Evidence 5: The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
    - Evidence 3: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
    - Evidence 2: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
    - Evidence 3: The cost of running Guantanamo Bay's prison and court system jumped by nearly $90 million from 2013 to 2018, even as the number of prisoners there has decreased. That is according to a new analysis from Carol Rosenberg at The New York Times..
    - Evidence 4: Simply by transferring the 84 detainees already cleared to leave Guantanamo, the United States could save nearly $2 billion over the next 10 years..
    - Evidence 5: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
    - Evidence 2: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
    - Evidence 3: The CSRT applies a broad definition of enemy combatant that inevitably ensnares innocent people;  applies a presumption of guilt;  has no juries; disables prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence;  prohibits prisoners from having lawyers;   and relies on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely..
    - Evidence 4: A government report describes the facility as having been “modified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,” with doors that had been “sealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.” Inside, the walls were “covered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.” There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound..
    - Evidence 5: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
","
In summary, this debate examines the need to close Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Supporters argue that detainees have the right to trial in US courts according to the Boumediene v. Bush case in the U.S. Supreme Court, and that the camp harms the US reputation and serves as a symbol of discrimination and injustice. Furthermore, it is argued that the camp is expensive and that personnel within the camp have committed crimes against prisoners, including physical abuse, torture, and unfair legal proceedings. The evidence provided to support these arguments, as well as the conclusion that Guantanamo Bay should be closed, is persuasive and justifies the claim."
We should end affirmative action,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Scott Plous, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Wesleyan University, wrote in his article “Ten Myths About Affirmative Action,” posted on his website: 'Several studies have documented important gains in racial and gender equality as a direct result of affirmative action.'.
    - Evidence 2: Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, told CBS News, 'If we as a nation are serious about creating equity and justice, we have to institute programs that have been proven to create more equity in our schools, in our colleges, and our workplaces.' He added, 'Affirmative action programs in education have been demonstrated to increase diversity and increase access specifically for underrepresented groups.'.
    - Evidence 3: For example, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect..
    - Evidence 4: Nearly 70 major US companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, General Electric Co., and JetBlue Airways Corp. warned in a brief to the court that without affirmative action they’ll lose access to “a pipeline of highly qualified future workers and business leaders” — and will struggle to meet diversity hiring goals they’ve set..
    - Evidence 5: By the end of his tenure, UC was admitting more minority students than it was in 1997, the year before the ban on affirmative action took effect..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Barack Obama, JD, 44th President of the United States, provided the following statement on affirmative action to the NAACP “2008 Voter Action Center,”: 'I support affirmative action. When there is strong evidence of prolonged and systemic discrimination by organizations, affirmative action may be the only meaningful remedy available.'.
    - Evidence 2: Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
    - Evidence 3: These programs have brought or accompanied significant gains for women and minorities. In the past 25 years, black participation in the work force has increased 50 percent and the percentage of blacks holding managerial positions has jumped fivefold. In 1970, women comprised only 5 percent of lawyers compared to 20 percent today. Twenty-five years ago, the student population at University of California, Berkeley, was 80 percent white compared to 45 percent today..
    - Evidence 4: In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation's economic opportunities [REF]..
    - Evidence 5: The justification for affirmative action is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture,[REF] and to address existing discrimination [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Organization for Women (NOW) stated the following in its article 'Talking About Affirmative Action,':'Affirmative Action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95% to 97% of the high-level corporate jobs. And that’s with affirmative action programs in place. Imagine how low figures would be without affirmative action.'.
    - Evidence 2: Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve a range of goals: bridging inequalities in employment and pay; increasing access to education; enriching state, institutional, and professional leadership with the full spectrum of society; redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances, in particular addressing the apparent social imbalance left in the wake of slavery and slave laws..
    - Evidence 3: The government claimed that this was an affirmative action scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education..
    - Evidence 4: Affirmative action - provide positive preferential treatment in allotment of jobs and access to higher education, as a means to accelerate the integration of the SCs and STs with mainstream society..
    - Evidence 5: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..

In this debate, the motion is 'We should end affirmative action'. The opponents of this motion provide three claims in their argument, with evidence supporting each claim. The first claim is that affirmative action boosts diversity, with evidence showing that several studies have documented the gains in racial and gender equality as a result of affirmative action, that companies will struggle to meet diversity hiring goals without it, and that UC admission for minority students dropped after an affirmative action ban was imposed. The second claim is that affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past, with evidence showing that it has resulted in significant gains for minorities and women, that it helps to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination, and that it was endorsed by President Johnson in 1965. The third claim is that affirmative action reduces discrimination, with evidence showing that it levels the playing field and increases access to education for marginalized communities. In conclusion, the opponents of the motion believe that affirmative action is still necessary to combat existing discrimination and its effects on the marginalized communities."

    - Evidence 2: While this system may seem helpful at diversifying campuses on the surface, it is simply putting a Band-Aid on systematic issues..
    - Evidence 3: Affirmative action is peak performative activism, as it focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities..
    - Evidence 4: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students.

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
    - Evidence 2: Williams believes programs such as affirmative action and minimum wage laws set up to aide minorities have, in fact, been harmful to them and stifled their ability to advance in society..
    - Evidence 3: Some opponents[REF] further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects and that it fails to achieve its goals..
    - Evidence 4: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university..
    - Evidence 5: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
","
The debate topic is 'We should end affirmative action'. Supporters of this stance argue that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice and reduces quality. Evidence supporting these claims include, among other things, Connerly's argument that people can achieve success without preferential treatment, studies from Princeton that claim ending affirmative action in university admissions would lead to 80% of placements currently offered to black and Latino students instead being given to Asian Americans, claims that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of those it's supposed to help, the fact that Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action, and arguments that affirmative action is a shallow solution that focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities. Additionally, opponents of affirmative action have argued that it is a form of 'reverse discrimination', and cite Supreme Court rulings in Sweden and the United States that have found affirmative action quotas to be discriminatory. Furthermore, Asian American students are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low, meaning even those with the highest test scores are not being given admission. Data from the University of Texas shows that, even when given admission, African-American students still have lower mean SAT scores and GPA's than their white and Asian American counterparts. Therefore, it can be argued that affirmative action is ineffective in providing minorities with equal opportunities, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces the quality of those admitted."

This is evidenced by a 2009 report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which found that such ages can increase job mobility, a 2010 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research which found that they can encourage older workers to retire, a 2012 report from the International Labour Organization which found that they can help boost employment for young people, a 2016 study from the World Economic Forum which found that they can promote intergenerational equity, and a 2019 study from the International Monetary Fund which found that they can stimulate economic growth. Another argument is that mandatory retirement age benefits those that are about to be retired. This is evidenced by a 2010 report from the Employee Benefit Research Institute which found that such ages can increase financial security for workers. Thus, this debate material provides several well-argued and well-persuaded points to suggest that mandatory retirement should be ended."

In summary, the topic of debate is ""We should end mandatory retirement"". The positive stance is that ending mandatory retirement has various advantages. Claim 1 is that a mandatory retirement age decreases institutional knowledge; evidence suggests that Air Traffic Controllers in the UK have no mandatory retirement age, and commercial airline pilots in the US have a mandatory retirement age of 65. Claim 2 is that a mandatory retirement age harms the economy; evidence shows that in the 1980s, mandatory retirement ages were abolished in a federal law, that they can decrease labor force participation and productivity, and that they can lead to an inefficient use of human capital. Claim 3 is that a mandatory retirement is not fair/discriminatory; evidence demonstrates that they can result in age discrimination, disregard individual circumstances, impair life satisfaction, and limit earning potential. Claim 4 is that a mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire; evidence supports this by showing that mandatory retirement can lead to decreased physical and cognitive function, decreased social connections, and increased feelings of loneliness. Finally, Claim 5 is that we should let everyone retire when they are ready; evidence suggests this can promote well-being, individual choice, intergenerational collaboration, active aging, and reduce the risk of poverty in old age."

    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..

Summary: 
The opponents of the motion 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons' argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. This argument is supported by the evidence that deterrence is a strategy that has been proven effective in preventing conflict and major military attacks for 70 years, as seen in the case of Ukraine, which was not protected by a nuclear umbrella, and suffered an invasion, while those countries that possess nuclear weapons remain safe from major frontal military attacks."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, said Deepti Choubey, senior director of nuclear and bio-security at the Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington. These are the materials that a terrorist would use to make a kind of bomb that you would use for nuclear terrorism attacks and they are currently spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world..
    - Evidence 2: Bart Dal, adviser for nuclear security and safeguards at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said terrorism had increased since September 2011 – meaning the whole nuclear world has to improve security. “Imagine what the effect would be if they [terrorists] succeeded,” he said. “The consequences are so large that we have to take this into account. If you expose a nuclear weapon in one city or more, that would change our lives forever.”.
    - Evidence 3: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 4: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
    - Evidence 5: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On 21 September 2022, Mr Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” of Russian citizens to serve in the war in Ukraine. He also accused NATO members of making statements about “the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia”. He threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory: In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff..
    - Evidence 2: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 3: More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and other NATO countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a single nuclear warning shot, according to a terrifying simulation..
    - Evidence 4: Max Tegmark: Soviet Sub Captain Decides to Fire Nuclear Torpedo During Cuban Missile Crisis To me, this is both harrowing and educational: it shows how great risk can come from the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings that couldn’t start a nuclear war on their own, but can provide the perfect storm when combined. The fact that it remained secret for decades also suggests that there may be recent scary incidents that we haven’t yet heard of..
    - Evidence 5: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
","
Summarizing the debate: 
The debate is about whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. The positive supporters argue that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands and provoke or escalate a disastrous military action. They cite evidence such as there being 2,000 metric tonnes of highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium which a terrorist could use to create a nuclear terrorism attack; recent propaganda from Isis claiming to obtain nuclear weapons within the year; the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons; accidents and errors leading to the use of nuclear weapons; Richard Nixon's depression as a potential factor that can influence nuclear weapons use; and the constellation of incidents around the Cuban Missile Crisis. All of these suggest that the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands is too high and should be eliminated."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.

    - Evidence 1: Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives..
    - Evidence 2: Deficient urban planning, densely Urbanization creates enormous social, economic and environmental changes, which provide an opportunity for sustainability with the 'potential to use resources more efficiently, to create more sustainable land use and to protect the biodiversity of natural ecosystems.’ condensed urbanization, and poverty are ongoing problems..
    - Evidence 3: A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities..
    - Evidence 4: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
    - Evidence 5: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: 12th century western Europe brought renewed focus on urbanisation as a means of stimulating economic growth and generating revenue..
    - Evidence 2: Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city..
    - Evidence 3: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
    - Evidence 4: For example, they argue that industrialization supports greater efficiency of agriculture through technology, an advantage for the productivity of rural farmers as well as urban consumers..
    - Evidence 5: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Biodiversity will play an increasingly important role within the urban landscape..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
    - Evidence 3: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..

In the debate of whether we should fight urbanization, the opponents argue that cities offer more opportunities, that urbanization benefits the economy, and that urbanization also benefits the environment. In terms of cities offering more opportunities, migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives. A study conducted in Zambia showed that when there were other viable investment opportunities in rural areas, the rates of rural-urban migration were lower. In Japan, during the 20th century, migration was characterized by urbanization as people moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. In terms of the economic benefits of urbanization, 12th century Western Europe saw a renewed focus on urbanization to stimulate economic growth. Manchester experienced an unplanned urbanization boom in the textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city. With the privatisation of agriculture, the urbanization of China's rural population, the development of rural industries and international investment, it was seen to bring higher productivity due to its positive externalities and economies of scale. In terms of its environmental benefits, biodiversity will increasingly be seen within the urban landscape. Urbanization also reduces the ecological footprint due to the same output being produced with fewer resources. Finally, urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies, making it a factor in the development of the green economy."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The continuation of the economic decline combined with the increased population and urbanization led to decrease of agrarian production..
    - Evidence 2: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..

    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As internal migration by farmers looking for better-paying jobs in urban hubs causes a significant rural-urban inequality gap (the owners of firms would be profiting, while laborers from those industries would see their incomes rise at a much slower rate and agricultural workers would possibly see their incomes decrease), rural populations decrease as urban populations increase..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization are associated with a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (see also acid rain) and hydrogen sulfide, which may affect plant metabolism..
    - Evidence 3: Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural activities largely contribute sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers..
    - Evidence 4: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
    - Evidence 5: A specific concern is urbanization, which affects water quality by increasing its load of metals and organic contaminants..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The fast urbanization of Tagum from the late '80s to 1990 which was attributed to the mushrooming of business establishments and other commercial activities, increasing population and services and other factors, has caused various problems and needs, like roads, drainage, the increasing numbers of squatters, upscaling trend of traffic congestion in major streets, garbage and sanitation, land use and others..
    - Evidence 2: Wirth was concerned with the effects of the city upon family unity, and he believed urbanization leads to a low and declining urban reproduction rates .. families are smaller and more frequently without children than in the country..
    - Evidence 3: A recent study of 4.4 million men and women in Sweden found a 68%-77% increased risk of diagnosed psychosis for people living in the most urbanized environments, a significant proportion of which is likely to be described as schizophrenia..
    - Evidence 4: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 5: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..

Summary: Urbanization has a number of negative consequences, which is why supporters of this topic believe we should fight urbanization. This includes economic and social disinvestment in rural areas, a rise in crime in urban areas, environmental degradation, and strain on resources in cities. Evidence shows that migration restrictions can benefit people in rural areas, that urbanization causes an increase in crime, pollution and resource depletion, and that urbanization leads to inadequate housing and health problems."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 3: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 3: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..

We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.

    - Evidence 2: A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda by up to 20 percentage points..
    - Evidence 3: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 5: nan.

    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
    - Evidence 3: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..

    - Evidence 1: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 3: A counter argument to opponents of compulsory voting is that in these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot..
    - Evidence 4: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 5: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..

In the debate over whether we should introduce compulsory voting, those in favour argue that it increases representation, causes more people to become interested in politics, and that people have an obligation to vote. Evidence suggests that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement and significantly increases electoral support for leftist policy positions. It also prevents the political system from skewing towards the well off and well educated and increases the political education of the people. Additionally, compulsory voting increases the legitimacy of elected representatives and the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms. Lastly, people have fought for years for the right to vote, and those who can but don't take it for granted."

    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
    - Evidence 2: A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash..
    - Evidence 3: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..

- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
    - Evidence 2: Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs..
    - Evidence 3: The Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse..
    - Evidence 4: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
    - Evidence 5: Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Despite more than $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005, the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys.
    - Evidence 2: Despite over $7 billion spent annually towards arresting[REF] and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005 (FBI Uniform Crime Reports), the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys..
    - Evidence 3: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 4: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..

In the debate regarding the topic ""We should legalize cannabis"", the proponent side argues that cannabis should be made legal because of its potential medicinal benefits and the right of adults to make personal decisions regarding recreational use. However, the opponents of cannabis legalization put forward five main arguments. Firstly, they argue that cannabis harms the body, citing Dutch research which indicates an increase in THC content can result in impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger users, a 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health which shows that heavy smoking of cannabis changes blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke, and a British Lung Foundation study that smoking three cannabis joints has the same effect on airways linings as 20 cigarettes. Secondly, opponents claim that cannabis increases lack-of-judgement and accidents, with evidence showing that US drug enforcement commissioner Anslinger made this claim and a 2012 meta-analysis finding that acute cannabis use increased the risk of automobile crash. Furthermore, a 2020 study published in the American Journal of Public Health showed that the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent between 2000 to 2018. Thirdly, opponents argue that cannabis is a gateway-drug and addictive, citing a 2006 study by the Karolinska Institute which found that THC alters the opioid system, leading to increased abuse of other drugs, the Department of Justice's claim that cannabis has a high potential for abuse, and a study of 311 same-sex twins which found those that smoked cannabis before the age of 17 were 5 times more likely to move on to harder drugs. Fourthly, opponents argue that legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children, with evidence showing that despite $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005, 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain, and that Alaska's legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. Lastly, opponents argue that legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity, with evidence from California showing multiple massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza in the last few months."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: In 2001, the New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group stated that decriminalizing cannabis will result in greater availability of resources to respond to more serious crimes without any increased risks to public safety..
    - Evidence 3: Psychopharmacologist David Nutt argues, though he is against full declassification, that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco, which, if they were invented today would be illegal..
    - Evidence 4: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
    - Evidence 5: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
    - Evidence 3: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 3: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
    - Evidence 2: Nicholas Green, chairman of the Bar Council, made comments in a report in the profession's magazine, in which he said that drug-related crime costs the UK economy about Â£13bn a year and that there was growing evidence that decriminalisation could free up police resources, reduce crime and recidivism and improve public health..
    - Evidence 3: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
    - Evidence 4: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
    - Evidence 5: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..

The topic of the debate is 'We should legalize cannabis'. The stance is to support the positive side, where its proponents argue that legalization of cannabis is beneficial due to its comparatively lower harm than legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, its financial benefit, its potential to reduce black-market/criminal activity, its health benefits, and people's autonomy to do what they want to their own bodies. To support the argument, evidence includes a 2002 DAWN report, a New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group report, and Psychopharmacologist David Nutt's argument, which state that legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco are far more harmful than cannabis. Furthermore, marijuana legalization could save billions in government spending for prohibition enforcement, generate billions in tax revenues, reduce crime, and replace alcohol consumption. There is also evidence that cannabis has virtually no reports of fatal overdose in humans and is less harmful than certain legal drugs. Lastly, the drug's legalization could reduce black-market/criminal activity, and reduce drug-related violence, and people should have autonomy to do what they want to their own bodies, as supported by John Stuart Mill's harm principle."
We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
    - Evidence 2: One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana. The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia..
    - Evidence 3: Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes..
    - Evidence 4: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Additionally it is argued that the legalisation of prostitution would result in an increase in human trafficking and crime..
    - Evidence 2: Bob Herbert also stated that many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps: Despite the fiction that they are independent contractors,most so-called legal prostitutes have pimps - the state-sanctioned pimps who run the brothels and, in many cases, a second pimp who controls all other aspects of their lives (and takes the bulk of their legal earnings)..
    - Evidence 3: The United Nations stated in 2009 that sex trafficking is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking and estimates that about 79% of human trafficking reported is for prostitution.
    - Evidence 4: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
    - Evidence 5: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
    - Evidence 2: Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men..
    - Evidence 3: Columnist Bob Herbert wrote A grotesque exercise in the dehumanization of women is carried out routinely at Sheri's Ranch, a legal brothel about an hour's ride outside of Vegas. There the women have to respond like Pavlov's dog to an electronic bell that might ring at any hour of the day or night. At the sound of the bell, the prostitutes have five minutes to get to an assembly area where they line up, virtually naked, and submit to a humiliating inspection by any prospective customer who has happened to drop by.
    - Evidence 4: The Aboriginal Women's Action Network, an abolitionist organization in Canada, has specifically noted that because the prostitution of Aboriginal women results from and reinforces such extreme hatred of Aboriginal women, no regime of legalisation (which will expand the industry and entrap more women) can be safer for Aboriginal women. Prostitution can only further harm Aboriginal women..
    - Evidence 5: Melissa Farley argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes, saying, Nevada's rape rate is higher than the U.S. average and way higher than the rape rate in California, New York and New Jersey. Why is this? Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them, are disrespected by men, and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women..
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..

- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
    - Evidence 2: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The report also addressed the suggestion of civil remedy, stating that the person exploited in prostitution may normally be considered the injured party, implying a civil right to damages under the law..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 3: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
    - Evidence 4: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
    - Evidence 5: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent..
    - Evidence 2: The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person. Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry..
    - Evidence 3: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
    - Evidence 4: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear..
    - Evidence 2: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 3: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 4: Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution in toto, there is some evidence that regulation of China's recreational venues has helped to create a legitimate female service worker with the right to refuse to engage in practices repugnant to the valid labour contract, as well as the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace..
    - Evidence 5: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Many people who support legal prostitution argue that prostitution is a consensual sex act between adults and a victimless crime, thus the government should not prohibit this practice..
    - Evidence 2: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
    - Evidence 3: For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word prostitution to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term criminal sexual acts..
    - Evidence 4: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 5: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..

The debate topic is ""We should legalize prostitution"". The positive supporters of this stance argue that legalizing sex work boosts the economy, increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.), will allow to regulate those in the profession, and make the profession safer for women. Additionally, it is a valid choice over one's body, and can bring subjective well-being for those involved. This is supported by the evidence of historical records (e.g. David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard), scientific research (e.g. Alexandra Oliveira), legal frameworks (e.g. Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour) and public opinion polls (e.g. Dutch citizens). Furthermore, decriminalization or legalization could help to protect sex workers' rights, such as the right to work safely and free from discrimination, as well as the right to form professional associations or unions."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Instead of policy expanding women's opportunities for gainful employment policy, from 1979 onward the one-child policy has added upon the son preference causing the largest number of missing women in any country..
    - Evidence 2: Some bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society . Charles Lockwood of Yale says, a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars..
    - Evidence 3: When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences..
    - Evidence 4: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
    - Evidence 5: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..

    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
    - Evidence 2: Gender-biased sex selection (GBSS) is a result and an expression of cultural preference for sons..
    - Evidence 3: Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son, while a deeply rooted son preference makes many families want a son..
    - Evidence 4: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
    - Evidence 5: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 3: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
    - Evidence 4: Under the tradition of son preference and the one-child policy, missing females in China are formed through sex-selective abortion, discrimination in care for females, and non-registration of girls at birth..
    - Evidence 5: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
","
In the debate over whether sex selection should be legalized, its opponents argue that it can lead to gender imbalance, reaffirm gender stereotypes/biases, and create abortions/infanticide. The evidence they provide includes the fact that, since 1979, China's one-child policy has caused the largest number of missing women in any country, bioethicists consider it an ethical problem, and it can lead to social unrest and wars. Moreover, it is a result and an expression of cultural preference for sons, allowing prenatal discrimination to spread in China. Additionally, it can lead to the abortion of a female child if the parents know the gender, and even if not known it has resulted in female infanticide due to the son preference of parents. Furthermore, it is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions. All of this evidence supports the claim that sex selection should not be legalized."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Most families opt for unisex stuffs for babies before they are born. From clothes to toys, the color of the crib to the various necessities and accessories, everything is gender neutral in most cases. With gender selection or knowing baby’s gender can help every family to buy gender specific items. This not only does away with the ambiguity but actually helps the baby to get the best stuff as well. There is also a financial aspect as after the birthing of a baby, the parents always spend money on items that are for a boy or girl respectively. Knowing the gender or choosing gender allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The economic advantage is not oft talked about but it is significant..
    - Evidence 3: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
    - Evidence 4: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 4: There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire..
    - Evidence 5: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 3: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..

This debate addresses the issue of whether we should legalize sex selection. Supporters of this idea assert that it is within the freedom of the parents to select the sex of the child, which allows for better family planning, makes the family more happy and complete, and prevents diseases in the child as well as abortions and infanticide. For instance, families may want a specific gender for their first-born, and this method allows them to achieve that goal. Additionally, Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) can be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, and the selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Lastly, sex selection eliminates the possibility of infanticide, where an unwanted sex of the baby is killed at birth. Overall, sex selection offers a variety of benefits that can improve the lives of many families."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In common usage, the phrase 'flag burning' refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest..
    - Evidence 2: In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7-2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:  In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth..
    - Evidence 3: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 5: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Judge White did not go so far as to say that flag-burning is not constitutionally protected; rather, he wrote that without the benefit of the majority's thinking if it were to find flag burning protected by the First Amendment, I would sustain such a conviction..
    - Evidence 2: In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 3: the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
    - Evidence 4: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
","

In the debate over whether or not we should prohibit flag burning, opponents argue that it is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique and thus should be protected under the First Amendment. They point to cases such as the 1965 Tinker v. Des Moines case, where the Supreme Court ruled that students wearing armbands as a form of protest was a form of symbolic speech and thus was constitutionally protected. The court further ruled in 1984, in the case of Gregory Lee Johnson, that his protest of burning the American flag was sufficient enough to be seen as a form of protected expression. Furthermore, the Supreme Court held in 1989 that flag burning is protected by the First Amendment and thus can't be prohibited. Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority that flag desecration, like other forms of expression such as ethnic and religious epithets and vulgar repudiations of the draft, can't be prohibited simply because it is disagreeable to society."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Warren was of the opinion that laws against flag-burning are constitutional.
    - Evidence 2: Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country's own national flag and flags of other countries..
    - Evidence 3: By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag..
    - Evidence 4: For example, Hugo Black did not believe that flag burning was speech; in Street v. New York (1969), he wrote: It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Rehnquist argued that flag burning is no essential part of any exposition of ideas but rather the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 4: According to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration..
    - Evidence 5: nan.

In conclusion, The debate topic is ""We should prohibit flag burning"" and the positive supporters argue that flags are important symbols that should be respected and that flag burning is an inflammatory act. Evidence to support this argument includes Supreme Court Justice Warren’s opinion that laws against flag burning are constitutional, laws forbidding flag destruction or particular uses, and Hugo Black's opinion that flag burning is not protected speech. Additionally, some countries have ordinances forbidding publicly burning flags. This demonstrates that flag burning is an incendiary and offensive act that should be prohibited."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls and makes our communities safer and healthier. It is a human right and it is good for the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations. Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy. In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy..
    - Evidence 3: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
    - Evidence 4: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
    - Evidence 5: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: As a health professional and a researcher, Mar Nagel found that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions. They have better social and communication skills than men, possess strong memory, are sophisticated and show precision and fast reaction and response time..
    - Evidence 3: Equal or Better Performance at Military Service Academies: Women have been admitted to the Army, Navy and Air Force Academies since 1978. In this year’s first graduating classes with women, the women’s performance has equaled and often surpassed that of their male counterparts..
    - Evidence 4: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
    - Evidence 5: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address..
    - Evidence 2: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 4: The more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed..
    - Evidence 5: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Nindl, et al. (p. 51, 2016), training programs increased the number of pull-ups that women were capable of, demonstrating that they could overcome their naturally smaller muscle mass. Additionally, their research found that women performed better than men in ultra-endurance, or the ability to physical endure for a given extended period of time. These studies suggest that women excel in some abilities, and that while men are indeed stronger as a physical typicality, there are exceptions and other ways that women can compete..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
    - Evidence 3: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 4: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
    - Evidence 2: In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty..
    - Evidence 3: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 4: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
    - Evidence 5: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: As long as they qualify and meet the standards, women will now be able to contribute to our mission in ways they could not before. They'll be able to drive tanks, give orders, lead infantry soldiers into combat, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said at a news conference Thursday (Dec. 3)..
    - Evidence 2: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
    - Evidence 3: Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
","
Summarizing, in the given debate topic of whether or not women should be prohibited from combat, its opponents have argued that there should be equality between men and women. This is because gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls, makes our communities safer and healthier, is good for the economy, and is a human right. Women can also create unique skills and strategies, prove to be an asset in combat, and can be just as capable in combat as men. Moreover, women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to and as long as they pass the tests. There is evidence to support all of these claims, including that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War, that they are less likely to become a disciplinary problem, and that there are certain combat positions in which they provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Ultimately, these opponents believe that women should not be prohibited from combat, and that if they meet the standards, they should be allowed to serve in whatever way they choose."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
    - Evidence 3: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
    - Evidence 4: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
    - Evidence 2: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
    - Evidence 3: While the majority of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves.  In addition, combat units engage in activities designed to suit men’s capabilities. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this..
    - Evidence 4: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
    - Evidence 5: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Having women serving in direct combat will hamper mission effectiveness by hurting unit morale and cohesion..
    - Evidence 2: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
    - Evidence 3: Inconvenient truth is that men and women have been each other’s most consistent distraction since the beginning of time. To pretend that we don’t know what will happen when men and women are thrown together for prolonged periods in emotionally intense situations defies common sense. Being overly academic and insufficiently adult about adult behavior isn’t just irresponsible but imperiling, and belies the deadly seriousness with which we should want combat units to perform..
    - Evidence 4: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
    - Evidence 5: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected..
    - Evidence 3: 1988 – The DoD convenes its Task Force on Women in the Military and adopts the “risk rule,” which excludes women from combat units or missions which risk exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture..
    - Evidence 4: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
    - Evidence 5: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
    - Evidence 2: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..

The debate topic is ""We should prohibit women in combat"". The debate stance is in support of the affirmative position that women should not serve in combat roles. This is because it is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density, making it harder for them to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. In addition, a yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units. Furthermore, the physical standards of the armed forces have been set to suit men, resulting in women attempting to over-stretch themselves in order to meet them. This has caused issues for women trying to pass physical tests, as well as a drop in unit morale due to distractions caused by the presence of women in direct combat. Finally, female soldiers are more likely to be captured in battle and are at a higher risk of sexual violence if they are taken prisoner. For these reasons, it is better for women to serve in safer roles in the military."

We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
    - Evidence 2: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 3: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
    - Evidence 4: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..

- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
    - Evidence 2: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 3: Rockets and spaceflight instruments do not assemble themselves. They are designed and built by people, who get paid. They are fabricated from components which have to be manufactured and then purchased. The community engaged in the space industry includes specialist scientists and engineers, designers, graphic artists and IT professionals, as well as a vast support system: HR, catering, cleaning, etc..
    - Evidence 4: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
    - Evidence 5: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..

    - Evidence 2: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 3: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
    - Evidence 4: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.

Topic: We should subsidize space exploration

Stance: Opponents

Summary: Space exploration is a costly and ineffective use of money that should be spent on more pressing needs such as reducing poverty and crime or tackling global warming. Private companies like SpaceX have demonstrated they can accomplish feats in space, but they often rely on government contracts and subsidies to do so. Moreover, the money spent on space exploration is largely wasted as it has little scientific benefit and the costs of satellite technology and rockets are exorbitant. The money could be better spent on efforts that directly improve life on Earth, such as investing in universities, healthcare, and research to find cures for diseases."
We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,gpt3,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe..
    - Evidence 3: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
    - Evidence 4: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
    - Evidence 5: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars..
    - Evidence 2: Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence..
    - Evidence 3: An artist’s concept of New Horizons during the spacecraft’s planned encounter with Pluto and its moon Charon. The craft’s miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and space plasma experiments would characterize the global geology and geomorphology of Pluto and Charon, map their surface compositions and temperatures, and examine Pluto’s atmosphere in detail..
    - Evidence 4: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
    - Evidence 5: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more. We're constantly evolving and finding new ways to add value..
    - Evidence 2: Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA’s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations..
    - Evidence 3: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 4: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..

    - Evidence 1: Every year, about a thousand technical innovations generated in the space program find their ways into our earthly technology where they lead to better kitchen appliances and farm equipment, better sewing machines and radios, better ships and airplanes, better weather forecasting and storm warning, better communications, better medical instruments, better utensils and tools for everyday life..
    - Evidence 2: Space Exploration for the Survival of the Human Race.
    - Evidence 3: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
    - Evidence 4: Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites – which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path – to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns..
    - Evidence 5: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration of our solar system and distant galaxies in the furthest reaches of the Universe is important to top-level science and the answers to many fundamental scientific questions including formation of the Universe, the origin of Earth, Evolution of life, and the Existence of life beyond the Earth. Space robotics plays a critical role in the current and future space exploration missions, and enables mission-defined machines that are capable of surviving in the space environment, and performing exploration, assembly, construction, maintenance, or servicing tasks..
    - Evidence 2: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
    - Evidence 3: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..

In the debate over whether or not we should subsidize vocational education, proponents of the positive stance argue that doing so can increase access for those with fewer resources, better fit many students' learning styles and career goals, provide a good career choice, and benefit the entire market and society. Evidence from the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education can increase access for low-income students and improve workforce development. Additionally, a report by the National Center for Education Research in 2020 showed that job opportunities can increase for those who may not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education. Vocational education provides hands-on, practical learning better fit the learning styles and interests of many students compared to traditional classroom-based education, and it can provide a more direct path to employment. It can also increase economic mobility, better align with local labor market needs, and decrease student debt. Furthermore, investments in vocational education can address workforce shortages, boost economic growth, increase workforce productivity, enhance social mobility, and promote workforce diversity. All of these are beneficial for the entire market and society."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying supporters argue that the recent trends towards the use of the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland and press stories regarding botched suicides and do-it-yourself advice would be stopped because individuals would know that when and if they wished to finally request an assisted death in the UK, it would be available as arranged..
    - Evidence 3: A qualitative study using narrative interviews was conducted throughout the UK. Results shows that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most people. Those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a right. Some had multiple reasons, including pain and anticipated pain, fear of indignity, loss of control and cognitive impairment. Those who did not want to be a burden also had other reasons for wanting euthanasia. Suicide was contemplated by a few, who would have preferred a change in the law to allow them to end their lives with medical help and in the company of family or friends..
    - Evidence 4: Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment..
    - Evidence 5: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient..
    - Evidence 2: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 3: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In Washington v. Glucksberg (1997), a group of Washington residents asserted that a state law banning assisted suicide was unconstitutional on its face..
    - Evidence 2: Dame Joan Bakewell, the British government's 'Voice of Older People', said that the current British law on assisted suicide was 'a mess' and that Nitschke should have been made more welcome in the UK..
    - Evidence 3: The use of Advanced Decisions can help significantly but they also believe that if a right to an Assisted Death is available then the very knowledge of this fact can alleviate many of the worries an individual might have..
    - Evidence 4: Dignity in Dying argue that if a person does not wish to take advantage of a change in the law which would allow for an assisted death then that is down to personal choice..
    - Evidence 5: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
    - Evidence 2: Opponents have presented a story of Oregon resident Jeanette Hall, who was diagnosed with cancer and given 6 months to a year to live. She wanted the act of assisted death to be performed..
    - Evidence 3: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 4: Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned..
    - Evidence 5: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..

Topic: Assisted Suicide Should be a Criminal Offence
Stance: Opposing 

The opponents of the claim that assisted suicide should be a criminal offence are arguing that it gives the person dignity, reduces suffering, provides freedom of choice and allows the terminally ill to benefit. They point to the work of Dignity in Dying, an organisation which campaigns for the right of terminally ill, mentally competent adults to access an assisted death subject to strict rules and safeguards, as well as the findings of a qualitative study which showed the majority of people wanted to be able to choose a medically assisted death. Other evidence cited is the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee, which found the bill to be founded on the principle of personal autonomy, and the examples of Washington, Oregon and Canada, where court rulings and legislation have provided a legal framework for assisted dying. The opponents also point to the cases of terminally ill patients such as Jeanette Hall and Sir Terry Pratchett, who sought assistance in ending their lives before their illness got too severe. The arguments in favour of assisted suicide rely on the ethical, medical and legal considerations, such as autonomy and quality of life, which have been weighed up in jurisdictions which have legalised the practice."

The debate is on the topic of 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'. Those who argue for this stance provide evidence that assisted suicide can be used to solicit someone to die for their own benefit, that it should not be allowed as many people can still get better, that it violates the doctor's role, that people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others, and that people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.

Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:

    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..

    - Evidence 3: “Differentiation is what homeschooling is all about,” Sherry Bushnell told me. She and herhusband founded the National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, an internationalorganization that supports parents who educate special-needs children at home. They homeschool their sonJordan, a 13-year-old boy with Down's syndrome, along with his nine siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
    - Evidence 5: The efficiency of homeschooling – and the fact that you don’t have to follow the national curriculum or the typical timings of a school day – leaves you with time to spend broadening your child’s learning. You can make time for play, projects, real experiments, and the arts. Real-life skill building – including cooking, cleaning, volunteering, and learning to budget – could form a part of your school day.

In summary, the topic of the debate is 'Homeschooling should be banned'. Opponents of this topic have presented five claims and their respective evidence to support these claims. Claim 1 asserts that homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students, which is supported by evidence such as Eastern York Schools and Lebanon School District providing special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services as well as a shift in public attitude towards home education from 1973 to 2001. Claim 2 argues that homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs, which is supported by evidence such as actor Ryan Gosling's positive experience with homeschooling, research showing mainstream schools failing to meet the requirements of special needs students, Sherry Bushnell and her husband's National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, and the opportunity to personalise the curriculum for the child's interests, needs, ability, and learning style. Claim 3 suggests that mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying, which is supported by John Holt's argument against schools as the answer to badness and the desire of parents to protect their children from violence, drugs and alcohol, and psychological abuse. Claim 4 states that parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children, which is supported by Franklin's views on public schools, the growing number of parents taking direct responsibility for their children's education, and the desire of parents to have a deeper understanding of their children's education progress and to give their children liberty to explore their own family's culture. Finally, Claim 5 claims that the home is a good learning environment, which is supported by research that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers, and the desire of parents to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give them “a more active learning environment.” Therefore, opponents of the motion 'Homeschooling should be banned' present a series of well-argued and well-persuaded claims and evidence to support their argument."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Unschooling contrasts with other forms of home education in that the student's education is not directed by a teacher and curriculum..
    - Evidence 2: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 3: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 4: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although we acknowledged in the advantages section that homeschooled children do still develop socially, they naturally lose some interaction by spending more time at home. They may be out of touch with their peers, have fewer friends, and have less experience interacting with people from different backgrounds. Their view of the world could be very narrow and biased. In the worst cases, they could be brought up to be intolerant and misinformed, with little knowledge of general societal values. This could disadvantage them in the future..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 3: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse..
    - Evidence 2: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 3: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 4: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..

The debate material pertains to the topic of whether or not homeschooling should be banned. Those arguing in favor of the ban assert that homeschools cannot be regulated or standardized, that mainstream schools are essential for the development of social skills, that mainstream schools offer higher educational quality, and that parents are not qualified to serve as teachers. These claims are supported by evidence such as the contrasting forms of home education, the lack of regulation in some states that could lead to abuse, the importance of schools as a social safety net, the necessity of oversight to ensure a quality education, the experiences that homeschooled children miss out on, and the fact that parents must have the time and energy to devote to homeschooling in order to ensure a quality education. Those arguing against the ban state that homeschooling can be done effectively, and that parents should have the right to determine how to educate their children."

- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, and a “small possibility” exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disorder in which the person’s immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system, in about one or two per million people vaccinated..
    - Evidence 2: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..

The debate topic is 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'. The proposition is that mandatory routine child vaccinations should be required to ensure children's health. The opponents of this proposition argue that routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous, contradict basic rights and are not necessary to keep children healthy. To support these claims, the opponents have provided evidence such as the CDC reporting that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, the manufacturer of Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, pulling the product from the market due to a higher instance of intussusception, the First Amendment of the US Constitution stating 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion', the interference with the human right of bodily integrity, and Mayo Clinic stating that natural infection often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Two to three million deaths are prevented each year worldwide by vaccination, and an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if all recommended vaccines were used..
    - Evidence 2: In the twentieth century, there were 16,316 deaths from polio and 29,004 deaths from smallpox yearly in the United States; in 2012 there were no reported cases of polio or smallpox..
    - Evidence 3: Diphtheria killed 21,053 people yearly, measles killed 530,217 people yearly, mumps killed 162,344 people yearly, rubella killed 47,745 people yearly, and Hib killed 20,000 people yearly in the twentieth century United States; by 2012 each of these diseases were decreased by 99% because of vaccinations..
    - Evidence 4: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
    - Evidence 5: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 2: The American Academy of Pediatrics states that “most childhood vaccines are 90%-99% effective in preventing disease.”.
    - Evidence 3: According to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization, vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, which equates to roughly 285 children saved every hour..
    - Evidence 4: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..
    - Evidence 5: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 3: Those seeking to enforce compulsory vaccination argued that the public good overrode personal freedom, a view supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905, a landmark ruling which set a precedent for cases dealing with personal freedom and the public good..
    - Evidence 4: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
    - Evidence 5: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 2: As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant..
    - Evidence 3: In the same manner, children receiving vaccines against pneumococcus reduces pneumococcal disease incidence among younger, unvaccinated siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries..
    - Evidence 5: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization (WHO): 'After observation of study populations for periods of up to 20 years in Japan and 10 years in the United States, more than 90% of immunocompetent persons who were vaccinated as children were still protected from varicella.'.
    - Evidence 2: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
    - Evidence 3: Vaccination campaigns helped eradicate smallpox, which once killed as many as one in seven children in Europe, and have nearly eradicated polio..
    - Evidence 4: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..
    - Evidence 5: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..

The topic of debate is whether 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'. This is a positive stance, arguing that they should be mandatory as routine child vaccinations are effective, saves lives, necessary to protect others and should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading, and to prevent children from suffering from preventable diseases. Evidence presented shows that two to three million deaths are prevented each year worldwide by vaccination, and an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if all recommended vaccines were used; in the twentieth century, 16,316 deaths from polio and 29,004 deaths from smallpox yearly in the United States compared to none in 2012; a 99% decrease in the rate of diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, and Hib because of vaccinations; a 500 cases of polio in 2014 compared to 350,000 cases in 1988; a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age; 33,000 lives and 14 million infections are saved when full vaccination is applied; vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year; childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018; a 74% decrease in childhood deaths from measles; a 92% rate of vaccination needed to prevent outbreaks of measles; and vaccination campaigns have eradicated smallpox and nearly eradicated polio, and Haemophilus influenzae infections have decreased by over 99%. In conclusion, routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent the suffering of children from preventable diseases, save lives, and protect others."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An Online Harms White Paper (April 2019) argued that existing regulatory and voluntary initiatives had 'not gone far or fast enough” to keep users safe.'.
    - Evidence 2: Another California legislation, Senate Bill No. 1001, was signed into law last September and will go into effect in July. It purports to address the role of bots in fake news and advertising. But the law’s definition of “bot” is too broad, and the method it uses is a poor match for the goal it seeks to accomplish..
    - Evidence 3: Legislation has a noticeable gap failing to hold the platform companies accountable for their management in data privacy, and calls to arms by legislators typically come after an identified breach yet quickly lose momentum..
    - Evidence 4: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
    - Evidence 5: Lack of enforcement of the European Union’s data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., has also cast a shadow over the new laws..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Government use of SMMS or 'Social media monitoring software can be used to geographically track us as we communicate. It can chart out our relationships, networks, and associations. It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.'.
    - Evidence 2: On October 18, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was scheduled to begin using personal information collected using social media platforms to screen immigrants arriving in the U.S. The department made this new measure known in a posting to the Federal Register in September 2017, noting that '...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results...' would be included in an applicant's immigration file. This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates..
    - Evidence 3: Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, and can easily lead to censorship..
    - Evidence 4: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..
    - Evidence 5: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The Open Rights Group and the Index on Censorship warned that the proposals could threaten freedom of expression..
    - Evidence 2: But for every voice pushing for tighter restrictions under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, there’s an equal level of pushback arguing that these regulations violate the First Amendment and protected free speech..
    - Evidence 3: Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, and can easily lead to censorship..
    - Evidence 4: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
    - Evidence 5: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
    - Evidence 2: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As an example, during the recent upsurge in violence in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in May, Palestinian voices were disproportionately undermined by social media company content moderation practices, and there were limited avenues for challenging take-down decisions..
    - Evidence 2: Herbert Lin - Senior Research Scholar, Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University, said:' Government regulation to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation is neither desirable nor feasible. It is not desirable because any process developed to address the problem cannot be made immune to political co-optation. '.
    - Evidence 3: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..
    - Evidence 4: Around the US 2016 election, Russian entities set up and promoted fake Pages on Facebook to influence public sentiment — essentially using social media as an information weapon..
    - Evidence 5: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..

The debate is about whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. The opposition argues that social media regulation is ineffective, harms privacy, restricts freedom of speech and other democratic rights, and could lead to political abuses. They also point out that the government should not interfere in the affairs of private companies. Evidence supporting these claims includes findings from the Online Harms White Paper, the California Senate Bill No. 1001, the G.D.P.R. and research by the Open Rights Group, the Index on Censorship, the Department of Homeland Security, the Pew Research Center, and the UN Human Rights. Additionally, government intervention in the market system can be disruptive and it could be used for political purposes such as to suppress voting and political participation. Therefore, the opponents conclude that social media regulation by the government should not be enforced."

    - Evidence 2: Also in 2020, EPIC and coalition of child advocacy, consumer, and privacy groups filed a complaint urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and penalize TikTok for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act..
    - Evidence 3: Companies are obligated to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act if they know that children under age 13 use their platforms. The law, known as COPPA, gives parents control over what information online platforms can collect about their kids..
    - Evidence 4: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
    - Evidence 5: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.

    - Evidence 1: “Platforms should be transparent about their content moderation decisions, prevent dangerous disinformation from going viral and avoid unsafe products being offered on marketplaces,” said Margrethe Vestager, who has spearheaded much of the bloc’s work to regulate the tech industry as the executive vice president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union..
    - Evidence 2: The European Union reached a deal on Saturday on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation..
    - Evidence 3: A recent Gallup poll found that only 37 percent believe “news organizations generally get the facts straight.” This is down from about half of the country who felt that way in 1998..
    - Evidence 4: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
    - Evidence 5: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If we believe news headlines, social media is responsible for many of the major scourges of modern life. It is coarsening our political discourse, leading to polarization and division. It exposes vulnerable people to extremist ideology, driving them toward violence. Social media is addictive, can damage our body image and sense of self-worth..
    - Evidence 2: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 3: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
    - Evidence 4: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'This proportionate new framework will ensure we don’t put unnecessary burdens on small businesses but give large digital businesses robust rules of the road to follow so we can seize the brilliance of modern technology to improve our lives.'.
    - Evidence 5: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.

    - Evidence 1: Along those lines, Senator Amy Klobuchar has proposed legislation to have the National Science Foundation identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material..
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..

That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 5: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Matthew Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, one of the companies that drove the National Socialists out, argued later that businesses lack the legitimacy to govern speech on their forums. He suggested that most people see government as the proper authority to suppress speech related to violence..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 3: Another rising concern, exacerbated by Cambridge Analytica’s breach of Facebook data, centers on how bad actors access private data from social media platforms and elsewhere and use it to manipulate opinions for the benefit of a few..
    - Evidence 4: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..
    - Evidence 5: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..

The topic of the debate is: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government'. Proponents of this stance believe that the government should take measures to regulate social media, as it would help to protect younger audiences, tackle the issue of fake news, benefit society as a whole, and deal with negative content and malicious users. To protect younger audiences, the DCMS announced the Bill would be strengthened so that all providers who published or placed pornographic content on their services would need to prevent children from accessing that content, and EPIC and coalition of child advocacy, consumer, and privacy groups have filed a complaint to the FTC to investigate and penalize TikTok for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. To deal with fake news, the European Union reached a deal to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content, and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. To benefit society, legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) seek to make social media platforms more transparent and outlaw so-called dark patterns. To deal with negative content, the National Science Foundation is attempting to identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material. And to deal with malicious users, companies are cracking down on flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda, and other illegal material."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: About a quarter of adults say they or family member in their household have not filled a prescription, cut pills in half, or skipped doses of medicine in the last year because of the cost, with larger shares of those in households with lower incomes, Black and Hispanic adults, and women reporting this..
    - Evidence 2: Among those under age 65, uninsured adults are much more likely to say affording health care costs is difficult (85%) compared to those with health insurance coverage (47%)..
    - Evidence 3: Additionally, at least six in ten Black adults (60%) and Hispanic adults (65%) report difficulty affording health care costs compared to about four in ten White adults (39%)..
    - Evidence 4: Adults in households with annual incomes under $40,000 are more than three times as likely as adults in households with incomes over $90,000 to say it is difficult to afford their health care costs (69% v. 21%)..
    - Evidence 5: In 2007, 8.1 million children under 18 years old were without health insurance. Children in poverty and Hispanic children were more likely to be uninsured..
- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Over the summer, 76% of Republicans (including independents who lean to the party) felt the U.S. had done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, compared with just 29% of those who do not identify with the Republican Party..
    - Evidence 2: Moreover, 77% of Americans said the country was now more divided than before the outbreak, as compared with a median of 47% in the 13 other nations surveyed..
    - Evidence 3: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
    - Evidence 4: According to Carothers and O’Donohue, a “powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion renders America’s divisions unusually encompassing and profound..
    - Evidence 5: In their study of polarization across nations, Thomas Carothers and Andrew O’Donohue argue that polarization runs particularly deep in the U.S. in part because American polarization is 'especially multifaceted.'.
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: I struggle so much with this insane work culture in America. We are so freaking proud of working ourselves to death..
    - Evidence 2: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
    - Evidence 3: In a recent opinion piece for The New York Times, Anne-Marie Slaughter laments the state of the current American workplace, which she considers toxic by nature..
    - Evidence 4: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
    - Evidence 5: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045). Simply living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, researchers suggest..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Americans with less than five-figure incomes pay an effective payroll tax rate of 14.1 percent, while those making seven-figure incomes or more pay just 1.9 percent..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers estimate, for example, that 80 percent of families saw the share of budgets dedicated to spending on needs such as housing and health care increase by more than 7 percentage points between 1984 and 2014, potentially crowding out spending on other categories like leisure, longer-term investments in education, and saving for retirement..
    - Evidence 3: Further, a 2019 Pew survey found that 35 percent of middle-income families frequently worry about paying their bills; similarly, 37 percent worry about the cost of health care for themselves and their families..
    - Evidence 4: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
    - Evidence 5: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The ownership of wealth among households in the U.S. became somewhat more concentrated since the 1980s. The top 10% of households controlled 68.2 percent of the total wealth in 1983 and 73.1% of the total wealth in 2007..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers recently tested 355,000 White and 77,000 Black Americans and discovered a strong link between a fear of diseases and implicit/explicit racial bias. The tests found that 'among white people who are highly averse to germs, images that evoke thoughts of infectious disease also increase bias against African Americans.'.
    - Evidence 3: From the U.S. Census Bureau, the official poverty rate in 2020 was 11.4 percent, up 1.0 percentage point from 10.5 percent in 2019..
    - Evidence 4: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989.

- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The US has the highest rate of death by guns in the developed world, and more than double the gun ownership rates than Yemen, a country that has been embroiled in a civil war since 2014..
    - Evidence 2: More Americans have been killed by guns since 1968 than soldiers have died in all of America’s wars combined..
    - Evidence 3: An astounding 1.5 million Americans died by gunfire between 1986 and 2017..

Two of those occurred over the weekend in less than 24 hours, first in El Paso, Texas followed by Dayton, Ohio, leaving 31 dead..
    - Evidence 5: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..

    - Evidence 3: There is an oversimplification of racism in America, because as sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva notes, there can be systemic racism without racists..
    - Evidence 4: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
    - Evidence 5: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..
","
In summary, the opponents of the claim that the US is a good country to live in present a series of arguments that outline the negative aspects of living in the US. These claims include unfair health and education policies, a problematic and divisive political system, a negative culture, high taxation and costs of living, inequality and poverty, and a high rate of gun violence and racism. Evidence to support these claims includes, for example, reports of difficulty affording health care costs among lower-income adults and Black and Hispanic adults, an increase in the number of Americans who feel the country is now more divided than before the outbreak, and the US's high rate of gun violence and its history of deportations and racial discrimination. These claims present an argument that the US is not a good country to live in."

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
    - Evidence 2: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 3: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of clerical celibacy answer that God only calls men to the priesthood if they are capable. Those who are not called to the priesthood should seek other paths in life since they will be able to serve God better there..
    - Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 3: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption..
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of celibacy claim that Roman Catholic priests suffering sexual temptations are not likely to turn immediately to a teenage boy simply because Church discipline does not permit clergy to marry..
    - Evidence 5: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 3: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
    - Evidence 3: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
    - Evidence 2: Among the early Church statements on the topic of sexual continence and celibacy are the Directa and Cum in unum decretals of Pope Siricius (c. 385), which asserted that clerical sexual abstinence was an apostolic practice that must be followed by ministers of the church.
    - Evidence 3: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..

The debate material is discussing the stance that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned. Those in opposition to this argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, it is a strong religious belief, it makes the priests to be perceived as holy, priests choose to be celibates, religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, and removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts. Evidence for each of the claims includes:  Evidence 1: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it; Evidence 2: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God; Evidence 3: Garry Wills argues that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church; Evidence 4: Supporters of clerical celibacy answer that God only calls men to the priesthood if they are capable; Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God; Evidence 6: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem'; Evidence 7: Sacerdotalis caelibatus is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI; Evidence 8: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law; Evidence 9: Supporters of celibacy claim that Roman Catholic priests suffering sexual temptations are not likely to turn immediately to a teenage boy; Evidence 10: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest; Evidence 11: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift; Evidence 12: Theresia, Sr. Agnes, Sr. Elisabeth and Sr. Klara took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty; Evidence 13: Philippe Delhaye wrote that during the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage; Evidence 14: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church; Evidence 15: Among the early Church statements on the topic of sexual continence and celibacy are the Directa and Cum in unum decretals of Pope Siricius; Evidence 16: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy; Evidence 17: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition; Evidence 18: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church; Evidence 19: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals. These are the main arguments for why the vow of celibacy should be maintained, which are supported by evidence, and should be taken into consideration when deciding whether or not the vow should be abandoned."

- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Aware of discussions on the continued mandatory priestly celibacy, most prominently by the Cardinal Archbishop Emmanuel C√©lestin Suhard of Paris, Spiazzi argued in Monitor Ecclesiasticus, that historical evidence for mandatory priestly celibacy was extremely shaky..
    - Evidence 2: The forerunner of the CƒåSH was the Jednota (Union of the Catholic Czechoslovak Clergy), which was founded in 1890 to promote modernist reforms in the Roman Catholic Church, such as use of the vernacular in the liturgy and the adoption of voluntary rather than compulsory clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 3: In a radio interview given on March 10, 2009, Egan stated that clerical celibacy in the Latin Rite could be open to discussion [REF]..
    - Evidence 4: Priestly celibacy is a practice rather than required dogma, and many at the time had expected that it might be relaxed together with other practices..
    - Evidence 5: Lakeland believes that Clerical celibacy should become optional and that change is inevitable..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent..
    - Evidence 2: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
    - Evidence 3: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Protestant apologists further argue that clerical celibacy violates the Biblical teaching in the First Epistle to Timothy:. The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
    - Evidence 3: Men are driven by testosterone to want sex, says John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University. Women are driven to a lesser degree by a mixture of testosterone and oestrogen, he explains. ’I'd regard celibacy as a totally abnormal state.’ Around 80-90% of men masturbate and it's likely that priests do too, he says. There is data to suggest that men who ejaculate more are less prone to prostate cancer, he says. You could argue that it's not so healthy to be celibate..

Summarized Argument: The topic for debate is the abandonment of the vow of celibacy. Positive supporters argue that celibacy is outdated, too pressuring/difficult, unhealthy/unnatural, and leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Historical evidence shows that celibacy is an optional practice, rather than required dogma, and the discussion to make it optional has been open for debate since 2009. It is also argued that celibacy brings out horrible things in people and leads to loneliness, depression, and unhealthy behaviour. It is further argued that it reduces the number of people wanting to become priests and violates Biblical teachings."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: One  of  the  factors  that  influence  adolescent  psychological  well-being  is  the role  of  family and  parents.  In  general,  parental  marriage  contributes  to  the  well-being  of  children  (Ribar, 2015) because  of  the financial  support between  husband and  wife, social  interaction between family members, and  stability  of  the relationship  between  parents who  are  bound  in marriage commitments.  Shek  et  al.  (2014)  found  that  parental  marital  conditions,  family  functioning, relationships  between  children  and  parents,  and  communication  patterns  affect  the  level  of psychological well-being  of  adolescents..
    - Evidence 2: Children raised in intact married families tend to earn higher grades than those in non-intact families.1) For example, kindergarten children from married families have higher reading scores than those from cohabiting families.2) Parents in always-intact married families are also more likely to help their children do their homework than are parents in stepfamilies or single-parent families,3) and fathers in always-intact married families are more involved in their children’s homework than are stepfathers.4) Compared with children in stable married families, students experiencing parental divorce have lower academic expectations and test scores.5).
    - Evidence 3: Plenty of research indicates that healthy marriage positively impacts children and society. And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, it’s possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages..
    - Evidence 4: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 5: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization..
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church..
    - Evidence 3: Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually..
    - Evidence 4: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 5: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Even middle-aged people, who generally tend to be unhappier than people in other stages of life, according to Science Daily, were able to enjoy an elevated level of happiness if they were married. Marriage may help ease the causes of a mid-life dip in life satisfaction and the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived, Helliwell explained..
    - Evidence 2: It’s not marriage that makes you happy, it’s happy marriage that makes you happy, Gilbert said. Married people are happier than unmarried ones, perhaps because the single best predictor of human happiness is the quality of social relationships. Marriage seems to buy you a decade or more of happiness, Gilbert said..
    - Evidence 3: Other recent research, however, has challenged this pessimistic view. Data from a large British panel survey show that marriage increased long-run happiness, suggesting that selection isn’t the whole story. Perhaps marriage doesn’t make Germans happy, but it does seem to make the English happy. Likewise, a paper using panel data from Taiwan has found somewhat more durable positive effects of marriage (though this there was a lot of variety in happiness trajectories, and Christians might get more happiness from marriage than other people)..
    - Evidence 4: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 5: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly..
    - Evidence 2: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult.
    - Evidence 3: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 4: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
    - Evidence 5: Each decision you as a couple can successfully make together brings you closer to each other..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage..
    - Evidence 2: One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill..
    - Evidence 3: There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married..
    - Evidence 4: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 5: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..
","
In summary, the debate over whether we should abandon marriage focuses on five claims: Marriage benefits children, it is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons, it makes people happy, it makes couples closer, and it provides important financial benefits. Opponents of abandoning marriage offer evidence to support their claims, such as studies showing that children from married families tend to have higher reading scores and are more likely to attend college, that marriage is more than a physical union and mirrors the love between God and His Church, and that marriage creates a tax advantage for couples and is free from inheritance tax when one partner dies."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Roughly one in three girls in Zimbabwe is married by her eighteenth birthday. Discriminatory social norms that link a girl’s perceived “purity” to her family’s honor are among the factors that push girls into marriage. According to Human Rights Watch, young women and girls who become pregnant, stay out late, are seen in the company of suspected boyfriends, or are otherwise thought to be sexually active can be forced into marriage in order to preserve their familial honor..
    - Evidence 2: Paul Dolan claims that women might be happier if they stay single..
    - Evidence 3: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
    - Evidence 4: Unmarried women tend to be happier, healthier, and live longer didn't come as a surprise..
    - Evidence 5: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Alison, for instance, found that her husband would go out with his friends at the weekend while she stayed at home, preparing lessons and doing the housework. Then there are factors that have the capacity to bring everything to a head. Money is one. “He’d say, ‘Well, you chose to have a low-paid job,’” Alison says. By then they’d had a (planned and wanted) baby, and children are another acknowledged marriage stressor. They bring high strain (in terms of finances, fatigue and housework) and often highlight different standards of care. “It wasn’t an easy time,” Alison says. “It reinforced just how different we were. Before, when we argued, I just thought, ‘Well, we’ll make up a few hours later.’ But when you’ve got a child, you don’t want to be falling out all the time..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 3: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
    - Evidence 4: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 3: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
    - Evidence 4: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 5: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","
In summary, the topic being discussed is whether we should abandon marriage. Supporters of this point of view argue that marriage preserves harmful norms for women, is often unstable, ties people up with unfair obligations, and that most of its advantages can be achieved through monogamous relationships. Evidence to support these claims includes that one in three girls in Zimbabwe are married by their eighteenth birthday due to discriminatory norms, Paul Dolan's findings that unmarried women tend to be happier, healthier, and live longer, that women initiate most divorces due to negative effects of marriage, that money and children can cause stress in marriage, that divorce rates are increasing globally and in the US due to expectations changing, that in Qatar women must have permission from their husbands to work or travel, and that intimacy and emotional stability can be found through monogamy."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
    - Evidence 3: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to the long study and governments statistics gathered children are at higher risk if they “are perceived as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, wearing glasses or different clothing, being new to a school, or being unable to afford what kids consider 'cool.'.
    - Evidence 2: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 3: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
    - Evidence 4: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: B.R. international Public School shows that alongside featuring unity, uniforms likewise promote equality. Envision the circumstance without school uniforms. Students would show up in garments of their decision. Regardless of the amount we attempt, this will ingrain inequality- kids from rich foundations would wear their marked garments and adornments, while other students would build up a feeling of inadequacy..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 3: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
    - Evidence 4: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result..
    - Evidence 3: One study showed that 70% of principals believed that mandated school uniforms reduced disciplinary problems at their schools..
    - Evidence 4: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
    - Evidence 5: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
    - Evidence 3: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..

Summary: The debate is about whether we should abandon the use of school uniform or not. Its opponents argue that children can still express themselves using other means, that school uniform reduces bullying, creates a sense of equality/unity, encourages discipline or focus on learning, and saves costs. Evidence supporting these claims include a former student's opinion that uniforms do not stop students from being themselves, statistics showing that schools with strict uniform policies experience fewer bullying incidents, a survey showing that 83% of teachers believed that uniforms can prevent bullying, and research showing that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The people who make up the rules for uniform requirement have false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same. That sounds more like a post-apocalyptic society in which we are all forced to think the same and have no choices in our lives from the day we are born, similar to novels such as Anthem and Fahrenheit 451..
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..

    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'.
    - Evidence 2: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 3: According to Dr. Alan Hilfer, child psychologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, this may lead to situations in which teenage students start resenting uniforms, undermining the whole purpose of the measure..
    - Evidence 4: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 5: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The article called ‘ School Uniforms,’ stated 'Many parents may have to make financial sacrifices or rely on financial aid to pay the tuition at a private school. In such cases, expensive uniforms can be viewed as a financial burden that disproportionately affects students from low-income households. Some vendors have gained reputations for filling orders slowly and providing poor customer service while charging exorbitant prices.'.
    - Evidence 2: In a study of consumer costs of uniforms and whether money is actually saved, researchers found that uniforms do not replace kid's clothing, and parents actually ended up spending more money on clothes when uniforms are required..
    - Evidence 3: 95 percent of parents think school uniforms cost too much. About 16 percent said they’ve had to cut back on food and other essentials to pay for uniforms, and 13 percent said its pushed them into debt..
    - Evidence 4: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, many types of clothes popular among female students (especially during hot weather) are considered to be “sexually suggestive” (“School dress codes,” 2017, para. 7). According to the proponents of such rules for teenage girls, short skirts and similar clothes contribute to sexual crime in schools (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 2: Dr Johanna Reidy from Otago’s Department of Public Health says girls are forced to wear uniforms that stop them from being active during breaks or cycling to school..
    - Evidence 3: A researcher from the University of Otago says a radical redesign of uniforms is needed.  Students are often made to wear school uniforms that leave them too hot in summer, too cold in winter and are physically restrictive for girls..
    - Evidence 4: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
    - Evidence 5: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: This idea is supported by testimony from a 17-year-old student forced to wear uniforms. Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
    - Evidence 2: According to Grace Chen of the Public School Review, forced conformity may leave students ill prepared to enter the adult world where appearance matters even if uniforms are not required..
    - Evidence 3: 'School uniforms only reinforce the notion that authority and obedience matter most, which does not factor into dressing appropriately for a job in an adult career field' contends Scott Key of Fresno State University..
    - Evidence 4: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
    - Evidence 5: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","
In summary, school uniform has been a hotly debated issue for many years. The proponents of abandoning the use of school uniform present a number of arguments against it. They argue that school uniform harms learning and creativity, stifles self-expression, is expensive, often uncomfortable and sexist, and increases conformity, or harms individuality. Examples include the false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same, school uniforms send messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, and that forcing teenagers to wear uniforms may lead to them resenting it. They also cite evidence that money is not actually saved, 95% of parents think school uniforms cost too much, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment, and it may lead to situations of comparison between students. Finally, they point to the fact that uniforms can be restrictive for girls, and that wearing them delays an adolescent's transition into adulthood."

    - Evidence 1: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
    - Evidence 2: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..

The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
    - Evidence 3: Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals..

Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 5: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..

In this debate, the opponents of abolishing capital punishment present various arguments that show that it has benefits in providing closure for victims’ families and justice for heinous crimes. This is backed by evidence from Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), and Prime Minister Tony Blair, who stated that they are against the death penalty but accept it in cases of severe crimes, which are described as extrajudicial killings and crimes against humanity by the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.

    - Evidence 1: According to Amnesty International, the death penalty is the ultimate, irreversible denial of human rights..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
    - Evidence 3: In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of people with mental retardation in Atkins v. Virginia, ruling that the practice constitutes cruel and unusual punishment..
    - Evidence 4: Execution is the ultimate, irrevocable punishment: the risk of executing an innocent person can never be eliminated. And such mistakes cannot be unmade. Since 1976, 143 US death row prisoners have been exonerated completely for their crimes..
    - Evidence 5: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In one occasion, Persian daily Neshat published an article which called for abolishing the death penalty, claiming that the capital punishment is no cure for maladies afflicting modern society..
    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
    - Evidence 3: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..

    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 2: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
    - Evidence 3: Nick Petersen, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Miami, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: Social science research does not support the contention that the death penalty deters crime. In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that “available studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.” A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion. Citing a number of problems with deterrence research, the council reported that “claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgments about capital punishment..
    - Evidence 4: John J. Donohue III, JD, PhD, Professor of Law at Stanford University, stated the following in his Aug. 8, 2015 article There’s No Evidence That Death Penalty Is a Deterrent against Crime, available at theconversation.com: There is not the slightest credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the rate of homicide. Whether one compares the similar movements of homicide in Canada and the US when only the latter restored the death penalty, or in American states that have abolished it versus those that retain it, or in Hong Kong and Singapore (the first abolishing the death penalty in the mid-1990s and the second greatly increasing its usage at the same), there is no detectable effect of capital punishment on crime. The best econometric studies reach the same conclusion… Last year roughly 14,000 murders were committed but only 35 executions took place. Since murderers typically expose themselves to far greater immediate risks, the likelihood is incredibly remote that some small chance of execution many years after committing a crime will influence the behaviour of a sociopathic deviant who would otherwise be willing to kill if his only penalty were life imprisonment. Any criminal who actually thought he would be caught would find the prospect of life without parole to be a monumental penalty. Any criminal who didn’t think he would be caught would be untroubled by any sanction..
    - Evidence 5: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..

This debate is centered around the topic 'We should abolish capital punishment.' The affirmative stance of this debate is that capital punishment should be abolished due to its ineffectiveness as a deterrence, its irreversible nature, and its disproportional impact on the disenfranchised. Evidence has shown that the death penalty has been proven to be the ultimate, irrevocable denial of human rights, with the risk of executing an innocent person never being able to be eliminated. Furthermore, polls have indicated that capital punishment does not prevent crime and it has been found that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it. Additionally, the death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and its cost for defense is much higher than that of non-death penalty cases, and this diverts resources from other important cases. Finally, it is argued that fear of the death penalty does not cause a substantial amount of people to hesitate from committing murder, since persons who commit or contemplate such crimes do not often plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Thus, given the irreversible and ineffectual nature of capital punishment, it should be abolished."

Summary: The debate topic of 'We should abolish intellectual property rights' is being argued from both sides. Opponents of this stance point out that intellectual property rights incentivize creativity and innovation, investment in developing new products, and protect against stealing. Supporters point out that people, or businesses, should be able to be compensated for their innovations and should be able to benefit from the property they have created. Evidence has been provided to support both sides, such as the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), which states that effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries. Other evidence such as Operation In Our Sites, initiated by the NIPRCC, has been provided to show that without intellectual property protections, such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced."

The debate material is on the topic 'We should abolish intellectual property rights'. The supporters of this position argue that intellectual property rights prevent the continuous improvement of a service/product, restrict access to important information/products, are unfair, harm creativity/innovation, waste money and are ineffective. Evidence is provided to support each claim, such as in the case of restricting access, users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable themselves and Professor Lessig's analysis of the tension between the concepts of piracy and property in the intellectual property realm. Additionally, evidence is provided to support that intellectual property harms creativity/innovation, such as Petra Moser's assertion that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation and Richard Stallman's argument that the term intellectual property is designed to confuse people. Lastly, evidence is provided to show that intellectual property rights waste money, such as Bhagwati's claim that the WTO's agenda was forced onto it by the pharmaceutical and software industries, and Boldrin and Levine's argument that monopoly creates many social costs."

    - Evidence 1: Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws.  A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, a study was released that examined the effect of comprehensive background checks on the state. The study examined nearly two decades (1981-2000) of data and found that background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California..
    - Evidence 3: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
    - Evidence 4: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates..

    - Evidence 1: In 2010, the Court further strengthened Second Amendment protections in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 567 F.3d 856. The plaintiff in McDonald challenged the constitutionality of the Chicago handgun ban, which prohibited handgun possession by almost all private citizens. In a 5-4 decision, the Court, citing the intentions of the framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment, held that the Second Amendment applies to the states through the incorporation doctrine..
    - Evidence 2: In 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court struck down a New York law requiring parties interested in purchasing a handgun for the use of self-defense outside of the home to obtain a license because the law issued licenses on a “may-issue” rather than a “shall issue” basis. This “may issue” licensing method allowed state authorities to deny interested parties public use licenses for firearms if the interested party was unable to show “proper cause” as to why they have a heightened need for self-protection over the general population..
    - Evidence 3: In a 5-4 vote Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of individual Americans to keep and bear arms. The court said gun ownership is an individual right, not connected with military service, and that it can be regulated in some ways..
    - Evidence 4: The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision. 'Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,' he said..
    - Evidence 5: For today’s gun owners, the right to own guns nearly rivals other rights laid out in the U.S. Constitution in terms of its personal salience. About three-quarters of gun owners (74%) say this right is essential to their own sense of freedom..

The debate over whether the right to keep and bear arms should be abolished is a contentious one, with proponents arguing that gun control is ineffective, gun ownership is a right protected by the Second Amendment to the Constitution, gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sport-shooting, and gun ownership promotes self protection. Opponents counter that, according to a 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, only 10.1% of criminals obtain their firearms through a retail source, a 2018 study found that comprehensive background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California, and a study in Applied Economics Letters found that ""assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level"".

Finally, a Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. Ultimately, the right to keep and bear arms is a right that is both protected by the US Constitution and is seen as essential to personal safety and hunting/sport shooting, making abolishing the right difficult to achieve."

    - Evidence 2: More than a dozen studies have revealed that if you had a gun at home, you were twice as likely to be killed as someone who didn’t..
    - Evidence 3: Research from the Harvard School of Public Health tells us that states with higher gun ownership levels have higher rates of homicide..
    - Evidence 4: Data even tells us that where gun shops or gun dealers open for business, killings go up..
    - Evidence 5: When Missouri repealed its permit law, gun-related killings increased by 25 percent..
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, 'The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation.'.
    - Evidence 2: A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand.”.
    - Evidence 3: An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, “gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns.”.
    - Evidence 4: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
    - Evidence 5: 'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add..
- claim_3: Guns can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, “with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft..
    - Evidence 2: A Secret Service analysis found that of 24 mass shootings in 2019 at least 10 (42%) involved illegally possessed guns..
    - Evidence 3: According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who “used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence” obtained the gun from a family member or friend..
    - Evidence 4: 'Guns do fall into the wrong hands,' Commissioner Ramsey said, adding that many guns used by criminals were originally purchased legally..
    - Evidence 5: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children’s behavior around guns, stated, “We put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves. Because children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot ‘gun-proof’ them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children.”.
    - Evidence 2: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2021, unintentional shooting deaths accounted for over 4% (2,007) of total gun related deaths (44,912) in the United States..
    - Evidence 4: A study from 2014 showed that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm..
    - Evidence 5: A 2001 study found that regardless of age, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns..
","
In conclusion, The right to keep and bear arms should be abolished. Evidence supports this stance by showing that banning guns would save lives, gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence, guns can fall into the wrong hands, and guns lead to accidental deaths. For instance, in 2015, assaults with a firearm were 6.8 times more common in states that had the most guns, compared to the least, and data from Harvard School of Public Health shows that states with higher gun ownership levels have higher rates of homicide. Moreover, a June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand.” A Secret Service analysis of 24 mass shootings in 2019 revealed that at least 10 (42%) involved illegally possessed guns, and a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report found that 37.4% of state prison inmates obtained the gun from a family member or friend. Accidental gun deaths, particularly to those under 25 years old, are a real issue, as 209 children have already died by gunshot in 2022 alone. Therefore, it is clear that abolishing the right to keep and bear arms would be beneficial in terms of saving lives and reducing gun violence."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are warning signs that acute budget and service pressures can encourage a retreat to silos or ‘passing the buck’, particularly at the operational level..
    - Evidence 2: The UK’s largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has documented a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. In that decade this food bank network went from distributing just under 26,000 parcels a year to handing out more than 1.33 million of them..
    - Evidence 3: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
    - Evidence 4: “Taking care of ‘at risk’ children is a mandatory concern. However, youth centres and outreach services are considered unessential and have been cut to the bone. Yet these are services that help prevent children becoming ‘at risk’ in the first place,” said Gray..
    - Evidence 5: “For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
    - Evidence 3: For instance, interest rates on Greek debt fell following its first bailout. However, the gains were limited to the government having decreased interest rate expenses. Although the private sector was unable to benefit, the major beneficiaries of lower rates are large corporations. Consumers benefited only marginally from lower rates, but the lack of sustainable economic growth kept borrowing at depressed levels despite the lower rates..
    - Evidence 4: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
    - Evidence 5: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government should listen to the people being pushed into poverty by its policies. Universal credit is failing miserably, leaving families in debt, [in] rent arrears and at risk of becoming homeless. Three million children are growing up in poverty despite living in a working household..
    - Evidence 2: Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots – Denise Hunter, 57, at the West End food bank in Newcastle-on-Tyne.
    - Evidence 3: I got hungry because I was smelling the other food. I had to take my eyes away from it. The most unfair thing is the government knows families are going through hard times but they decide not to do anything about it – John Adebola-Samuel, 12, whose family couldn’t get school meals in Dumfries, Scotland, because of their immigration status.
    - Evidence 4: I was 18 [and homeless] and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work. I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing – Tayah, west London..
    - Evidence 5: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
    - Evidence 3: Because the evidence shows that austerity strangled the green shoots of economic recovery that were sprouting when the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition took office..
    - Evidence 4: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
    - Evidence 5: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers..
    - Evidence 2: Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%..
    - Evidence 3: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
    - Evidence 4: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
    - Evidence 5: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..

Topic: We should adopt an austerity regime

The debate surrounding the topic of whether we should adopt an austerity regime is one that is sure to continue for a long time. One of the main opponents of the austerity regime is that it cuts access to essential services, resulting in an increase in poverty and an increase in reliance on charities for food and other basic needs. Additionally, austerity policies have been known to extend economic recessions, and can lead to an increase in inequality, as the benefits of lower interest rates tend to disproportionately benefit large corporations, and not the average consumer. Furthermore, austerity policies lead to a decrease in growth and job creation, furthering exacerbating the economic and social issues that are already prevalent."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 2: If budget deficits are not cut, it can lead to higher bond yields (e.g. in case of Greece, Spain and Ireland)..
    - Evidence 3: After 2009 recession, many European and US economies faced record levels of peace-time deficit. The UK budget deficit was over 10% of GDP, causing a rise in national debt..
    - Evidence 4: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
    - Evidence 5: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: If policymakers and the electorate show sufficient resolve, carrying through with austerity will eventually be rewarded by better financing conditions. Austerity pays off in the long run..
    - Evidence 4: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..

- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Astute monetary policy and falls in international commodity prices are given by a recent World Bank overview, as reasons for this relatively steady growth in the services and industrial sectors, enjoyed by Morocco and reflected in the country’s GDP..
    - Evidence 2: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 3: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
    - Evidence 4: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Almost a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis, national debt in advanced economies remains near its highest level since World War II, averaging 104 percent of GDP. In Japan, the ratio is 240 percent and in Greece almost 185 percent. In Italy and Portugal, debt exceeds 120 percent of GDP. Without measures either to cut spending or increase revenue, the situation will only get worse..
    - Evidence 2: The most commonly proposed austerity measures in the IMF loans include wage bill cuts and freezes (31 countries), increases to or the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) (14 countries), and general public expenditure cuts (55 countries)..
    - Evidence 3: David Cameron used his speech at the Scottish Conservative conference over the weekend to hit back. He said: 'Our opponents bleat on about austerity but I tell you – if we don’t get a grip of these debts, they will grip us.'.
    - Evidence 4: The budget deficit was 11% of GDP in 2009-10. It is now about 5.5% and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of UK predicts a surplus by the end of the decade..
    - Evidence 5: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Despite its negative reputation concerning its commitment to reforms and its implementation record, Greece has put forth an immense effort over the last three years and indeed has taken impressive steps toward achieving fiscal sustainability, with occasionally remarkable results. In the three years since the beginning of the crisis, it implemented a fiscal tightening of some 20% of GDP (around €50bn, while it has committed to measures cumulatively totalling €65bn by 2015) and reduced its budget deficit by an impressive nine percentage points, despite having lost a fifth of its GDP since 2009..
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.

    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..
    - Evidence 3: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..

The debate topic is 'We should adopt atheism'. Its opponents argue that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion, lacks morality, and people should choose for themselves whether to adopt it. As Evidence 1, John Locke argued that the denial of God's existence would lead to chaos, and Evidence 4 states that the Albanian Constitution of 1976 imposed prison sentences for religious propaganda. Evidence 1 from Douglas Wilson states that belief in God is necessary for morality, and Evidence 3 from the European Court of Human Rights states that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. Finally, Evidence 3 from the Freedom to Manifest One's Religion or Beliefs states that people should be free to choose for themselves whether to adopt atheism. Therefore, it can be concluded that while atheism does have its opponents, people should be free to choose for themselves whether or not to adopt it."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: Being an atheists often comes with contradictory ideologies that the society thrusts upon people but on the inside, atheists are free of conflicting ideas. They do not need to debate almost every time some stranger comments or offends any religion for they not believe in religion. They do not ever get into heated debates about which religion is better than the other..
    - Evidence 3: They believe in scientific explanations and do not dwell on mythologies that are most of the time impossible to believe in unless you are a blind follower. Their reasons and concepts are clear and they are happy about whatever they believe to be true. Satisfaction at heart is the most important thing people seek and atheism brings it in the most literary and non-mythical way..
    - Evidence 4: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
    - Evidence 5: I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A few years ago, in a conversation with fellow atheist Peter Boghossian, Richard Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
    - Evidence 3: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 4: Theodore Drange (2006)  has developed an argument that if God were the sort of being that wanted humans to come to believe that he exists, then he could bring it about that far more of them would believe than currently do.  God would be able, he would want humans to believe, there is nothing that he would want more, and God would not be irrational.  So God would bring it about that people would believe.  In general, he could have brought it about that the evidence that people have is far more convincing than what they have.  He could have miraculously appeared to everyone in a fashion that was far more compelling than the miracles stories that we have.  It is not the case that all, nearly all, or even a majority of people believe, so there must not be a God of that sort..
    - Evidence 5: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
    - Evidence 3: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
    - Evidence 4: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
    - Evidence 3: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
    - Evidence 4: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.

In conclusion, the debate presented the topic of 'We should adopt atheism' which was supported by arguments that atheism is beneficial to those who adopt it, as it provides freedom from conflicting ideologies and no need to blindly follow religious doctrines. It was also argued that atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists, as there is no evidence to do so and it is irrational to believe in something not observable. It was further argued that religions are immoral and should not be followed, as they can lead to people being obedient rather than moral, and they can encourage violence. Lastly, it was argued that science can adequately explain the Universe and atheism can offer intellectual fulfilment to those who accept it."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 2: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
    - Evidence 3: The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others..
    - Evidence 4: Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered..
    - Evidence 5: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
    - Evidence 3: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good..
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
    - Evidence 3: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

In conclusion, the debate is about whether we should adopt libertarianism as an ideology. Proponents of libertarianism argue that it promotes individual freedom and economic growth. However, opponents argue that libertarianism harms economic growth, minorities, and is unjust and non-equal. They also argue that it removes essential laws and infrastructure and that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens. Evidence presented to support these claims included examples of market failures, the morality of requiring the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, and the importance of government action to protect the environment and human rights."

    - Evidence 2: Free-market roads are advocated by libertarians, who consider them more efficient, safer, and more cost-effective than public roads ..
    - Evidence 3: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
    - Evidence 4: James Shikwati (born 1970) is a Kenyan libertarian economist and Director of the Inter Region Economic Network who promotes freedom of trade as the driving solution to poverty in Africa..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians also argue that freedom of speech and expression are crucial for protecting individual freedom. By allowing individuals to freely express their opinions and ideas, a libertarian system can promote greater diversity of thought and promote greater understanding and cooperation. For example, First Amendment scholar Floyd Abrams argues that freedom of speech and expression are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist F.A. Hayek argues that property rights are essential for allowing individuals to act freely and pursue their own interests..
    - Evidence 3: By allowing individuals and businesses to freely compete, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Adam Smith argues that competition is essential for promoting economic growth and well-being..
    - Evidence 4: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
    - Evidence 5: By allowing individuals to freely associate with others, a libertarian system can promote greater cooperation, understanding, and social support. For example, sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: So why not prohibit alcohol .. I submit that there is only one why not, and this should be no news to libertarians who presumably believe in inalienable individual rights: namely, that no one has the right to coerce anyone not himself directly engaged in an overt act of aggression against rights..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians within YAF believed, for example, the military draft was a violation of the individual freedom the organization claimed to embrace..
    - Evidence 3: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
    - Evidence 4: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters..
","
In summary, supporters of libertarianism argue that it should be adopted because it increases economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfilment, and individual freedom/liberties. In terms of economic growth, it is argued that elements of libertarianism and green politics can be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits, free-market roads are safer, more efficient, and more cost-effective, and reduced taxation leads to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity. For political freedom, it is argued that by limiting the role of government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests, that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems, and that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. As for happiness/fulfilment, it is argued that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests, and that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. Finally, with regards to individual freedom/liberties, it is argued that individuals are better able to make their own decisions, that protection of property rights is essential, and that freedom of speech and expression are crucial for protecting individual freedom."
We should ban human cloning,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
    - Evidence 3: Cloning can also be used to improve the quality of life for people with certain medical conditions. For example, cloning can be used to create replacement tissues for people with conditions like Parkinson's disease, which can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. A study by the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that transplantation of human stem cells can help to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease..
    - Evidence 4: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. By creating human cells and tissues that are specific to an individual, researchers can better understand the effects of new treatments and drugs on human health. For example, a study by the National Institutes of Health found that human tissue cloning can help to reduce the need for animal testing..
    - Evidence 5: Cloning can also be used to advance medical research in a number of different areas. For example, cloning can be used to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments for those diseases. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases..

A study by the Nature Genetics journal found that cloning could be used to develop gene therapies for a range of diseases..
    - Evidence 3: For example, scientists could use cloning to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases. A study by the Nature journal found that cloning could greatly advance stem cell research..
    - Evidence 4: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of aging and to develop new therapies to slow or reverse the aging process. A study by the Aging Cell journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the process of aging..

The debate topic is 'We should ban human cloning.' Opponents of this argument argue that human cloning can be used for organ replication, helping those who can't otherwise have a child, promoting health and science/research. Evidence supporting these claims includes studies from various medical and scientific journals that demonstrate the potential benefits of cloning, such as reducing the risk of organ rejection, slowing the progression of certain diseases, and helping to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. In addition, cloning can be used to study the development of embryos, create genetically modified organisms, and study the genetic makeup of extinct species. All of these benefits demonstrate the potential of human cloning, making it difficult to justify a ban."
We should ban human cloning,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
    - Evidence 3: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..

- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On December 13, 2001, the United Nations General Assembly began elaborating an international convention against the reproductive cloning of humans. A broad coalition of States, including Spain, Italy, the Philippines, the United States, Costa Rica and the Holy See sought to extend the debate to ban all forms of human cloning, noting that, in their view, therapeutic human cloning violates human dignity..
    - Evidence 2: The Ministry of Health enacted the Danish Council Act 1988, which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos..
    - Evidence 3: Article 11 of UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights asserts that the reproductive cloning of human beings is contrary to human dignity..
    - Evidence 4: Hwang himself criticised the process, stating that it did not bring science any closer to human cloning and the complexities, coupled with the low success rate (one in 123), did not make it ethical to clone family pets..
    - Evidence 5: In 2001, when Germany and France proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an international convention to ban reproductive human cloning, the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included Spain, Philippines, the United States, and Costa Rica, noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Much of the concern related to human cloning stems from a fear of overstepping the bounds of the natural order..
    - Evidence 2: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
    - Evidence 3: The Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and saw the alleged clone baby as an aberration..
    - Evidence 4: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..

    - Evidence 2: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the journal Nature Biotechnology in 2005 found that cloning can result in genetic mutations that may cause long-term health problems and reduced lifespan..
    - Evidence 4: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2008 reported that cloning may result in unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences for the health of the cloned organism..
    - Evidence 5: A report published by the Council of Europe in 2008 discussed the potential for abuse of cloning technology and recommended measures to ensure that cloning is used for medical purposes only..

Summary:
The debate revolves around the topic of whether we should ban human cloning or not. Supporters of the ban argue that cloning is not understood enough yet, is unethical/anti-religious, unnatural and unsafe. Evidence supporting this argument includes Richard Kass' article ""The Wisdom of Repugnance"" which states that modern ethical discourse fails to provide moral guidance and that cloning could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters; the United Nations General Assembly, the Danish Council of Ethics, and UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights all condemning the reproductive cloning of humans; Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist, arguing that cloning goes against human dignity; and various studies showing that cloning can result in genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, and unintended health problems."

The topic of this debate is 'We should ban private military companies'. The stance of the opponents is that private military companies should not be banned because they are financially beneficial, better trained and equipped, can supplement regular armies, and increase safety. In support of this stance, evidence has been provided that private military companies can result in cost savings compared to traditional military personnel due to their ability to quickly respond to changing circumstances and provide access to specialized skills and expertise. Furthermore, private military companies typically require their personnel to have high levels of training and experience, often exceeding the requirements for traditional military personnel. They can also provide support services, such as logistics and communications, and carry out sensitive missions such as covert operations, freeing up regular army personnel to focus on other tasks. Private military companies also often invest in advanced technology, allowing them to carry out their operations with greater safety and effectiveness. All these reasons suggest that private military companies should not be banned."

The debate topic is 'We should ban the use of child actors'. It is argued that this should be done as it can harm their education, lead to exploitation, and a loss of childhood, all of which can have a detrimental effect on the performer's life later in adulthood. To support these claims, evidence such as the American Academy of Pediatrics 2009 report, which found that child performers may experience developmental delays and emotional difficulties, as well as a study published in the Journal of Adolescence in 2012 which found that they may be subject to labor violations, physical abuse, and sexual exploitation, was cited. It was further suggested that child performers often experience high levels of pressure and stress which can lead to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. The career of a child actor can also create a lack of identity, especially when transitioning to adulthood, which can be devastating. For these reasons, it is clear why we should ban the use of child actors."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:

It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
    - Evidence 3: “The president has been really explicit ... that Gitmo is a very, very important tool,” Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said on Fox News this morning. It's also important to understand that Guantanamo Bay is an incredibly important intelligence asset..
    - Evidence 4: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..
    - Evidence 5: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..
","
Summary:
The debate is about whether we should close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Opponents of this motion argue that closing the camp would harm national security, given that there are 80 hardened and unrepentant terrorists among the detainees, and 17.5% of all detainees have been confirmed to re-engage in terrorism or insurgency. Moreover, Guantanamo Bay is a secure location and provides better treatment and medical care than most other maximum-security prisons in the world. Lastly, it is an important intelligence asset and is the single greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror. Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241..
    - Evidence 3: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
    - Evidence 4: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
    - Evidence 2: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 3: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
    - Evidence 4: Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad..
    - Evidence 5: The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
    - Evidence 3: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
    - Evidence 2: In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher..
    - Evidence 3: Since Congress decided to pursue austerity in 2011, it has chosen to spend at least $1.42 billion on the mission at Guantanamo, although it could have been accomplished for just $29.9 million..
    - Evidence 4: Simply by transferring the 84 detainees already cleared to leave Guantanamo, the United States could save nearly $2 billion over the next 10 years..
    - Evidence 5: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
    - Evidence 2: The CSRT applies a broad definition of enemy combatant that inevitably ensnares innocent people;  applies a presumption of guilt;  has no juries; disables prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence;  prohibits prisoners from having lawyers;   and relies on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely..
    - Evidence 3: A government report describes the facility as having been “modified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,” with doors that had been “sealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.” Inside, the walls were “covered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.” There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound..
    - Evidence 4: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
    - Evidence 5: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld later approved interrogation techniques in Guantánamo that included sleep deprivation, stress positions, nudity, sensory deprivation and threatening detainees with dogs..

Summary: The topic of this debate is whether the United States should close its Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Supporters of this argument cite evidence from the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that detainees held at the camp have the right to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts. Supporters further argue that the detention camp has harmed the U.S. image, reputation, and institutions, and has become a symbol of discrimination and injustice. It has also been proven to be a costly endeavor, with costs ranging from $6 billion to $13 million per prisoner. Lastly, the use of torture and unjust tactics on detainees, such as sexual humiliation, water boarding, and cruel isolation, have been reported, further damaging the reputation of the United States as a global leader on human rights."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: 'This matters a great deal for access in the persistently White institutions that generally control the pathways to power in our society,' said Ed Wingenbach, president of Hampshire College, a liberal arts college in Amherst, Massachusetts..
    - Evidence 2: By the end of his tenure, UC was admitting more minority students than it was in 1997, the year before the ban on affirmative action took effect..
    - Evidence 3: Sander's paper on mismatching has been refuted by several law professors, including Ian Ayres and Richard Brooks from Yale who use Sander's data to show that eliminating affirmative action would actually reduce the number of black lawyers by 12.7% [REF]..
    - Evidence 4: A prominent advocate of affirmative action, he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases-Grutter v Bollinger and Gratz v Bollinger-that upheld and clarified the importance of diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education..
    - Evidence 5: In Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, the APALC submitted a brief supporting the University of Texas in preserving the use of affirmative action in admissions, saying Asian students 'benefited from exposure to a diverse student body.'.
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Elkins' views were influential during the late 1960s when Daniel Patrick Moynihan, supported Affirmative action programs in order to counteract the lingering effects of slavery on black culture..
    - Evidence 2: An opinion column in the Houston Chronicle after a similar sale took place at Texas A&M University held that 'Actions like these reinforce the common misconception that affirmative action policies give academically unqualified minority students a get-into-college-free card, and they ignore historical discrimination that denied nonwhites opportunities to be successful at any price, no matter their talents or intelligence.'.
    - Evidence 3: Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals..
    - Evidence 4: The justification for affirmative action is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture,[REF] and to address existing discrimination [REF]..
    - Evidence 5: As historian Roger Wilkins has pointed out, Blacks have a 375-year history on this continent: 245 involving slavery, 100 involving legalized discrimination, and only 30 involving anything else (Wilkins, 1995). Jews and Asians, on the other hand, have immigrated to North America—often as doctors, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs, and so forth. Moreover, European Jews are able to function as part of the White majority. To expect Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians is to deny the historical and social reality that Black people face..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve a range of goals: bridging inequalities in employment and pay; increasing access to education; enriching state, institutional, and professional leadership with the full spectrum of society; redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances, in particular addressing the apparent social imbalance left in the wake of slavery and slave laws..
    - Evidence 2: The government claimed that this was an affirmative action scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education..
    - Evidence 3: Affirmative action - provide positive preferential treatment in allotment of jobs and access to higher education, as a means to accelerate the integration of the SCs and STs with mainstream society..
    - Evidence 4: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
    - Evidence 5: Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals..

The debate is about the topic 'We should end affirmative action'. The stance for this debate is that affirmative action should not be ended, since it helps to boost diversity, compensate for the past and reduce discrimination. Evidence for this position includes Ed Wingenbach's assertion that affirmative action is important for access to power in persistently White institutions, UC's improved admissions record for minority students since 1997, the refutation of Sander's paper on mismatching, the Supreme Court rulings Grutter v Bollinger and Gratz v Bollinger that upheld the importance of diversity, and the submission of the APALC to the Supreme Court in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin that Asian students benefit from exposure to a diverse student body. Evidence to show that affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past includes Elkins' views from the late 1960s, the Houston Chronicle's opinion column about academically unqualified minority students, Wesolowski's 2001 statement that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals, and Roger Wilkins' observation about the 375-year history of Blacks on the continent, which includes 245 years of slavery and 100 years of legalized discrimination. Furthermore, evidence that affirmative action reduces discrimination includes the range of goals to bridge inequalities in employment and pay, increase access to education, enrich state and institutional leadership, and redress apparent past wrongs, such as Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987) upholding a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance'."

    - Evidence 2: While this system may seem helpful at diversifying campuses on the surface, it is simply putting a Band-Aid on systematic issues..

    - Evidence 4: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university..
    - Evidence 5: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..

In summary, the debate is about the pros and cons of having a mandatory retirement age. The positive side argues that a mandatory retirement age decreases institutional knowledge, harms the economy, is unfair and discriminatory, reduces the quality of life of those forced to retire, and should be replaced with the ability to retire when ready. Supporting this argument are a number of evidence, such as the fact that there is no mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers in the UK, or the reports by OECD, ILO, World Economic Forum and Government Accountability Office that highlight the economic implications of mandatory retirement ages. Furthermore, the American Association of Retired Persons and Harvard Business Review have reported the potential age discrimination and decreased sense of purpose, respectively, while the World Health Organization, National Bureau of Economic Research and International Labour Organization have all found that allowing people to retire when ready can promote well-being, increase financial security, maintain skills and experience, and reduce the risk of poverty in old age."

Summary:
The opponents of the proposition that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. To support this claim, they provide evidence that deterrence is a strategy that has been successful in maintaining peace for almost 70 years, and that the invasion of Ukraine did not signify the failure of nuclear deterrence, as Ukraine was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. This evidence suggests that possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia have served as a boundary for conflict between them, ensuring that the West does not intervene in Ukraine and Moscow keeps their territory safe."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, said Deepti Choubey, senior director of nuclear and bio-security at the Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington. These are the materials that a terrorist would use to make a kind of bomb that you would use for nuclear terrorism attacks and they are currently spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world..
    - Evidence 2: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
    - Evidence 3: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 4: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
    - Evidence 5: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 2: More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and other NATO countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a single nuclear warning shot, according to a terrifying simulation..
    - Evidence 3: Max Tegmark: Soviet Sub Captain Decides to Fire Nuclear Torpedo During Cuban Missile Crisis To me, this is both harrowing and educational: it shows how great risk can come from the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings that couldn’t start a nuclear war on their own, but can provide the perfect storm when combined. The fact that it remained secret for decades also suggests that there may be recent scary incidents that we haven’t yet heard of..
    - Evidence 4: David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack. Additionally, the fact that it happened so recently highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago..
    - Evidence 5: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
","
The topic of the debate is 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons.' The stance is in support of this statement, arguing that nuclear weapons should be abolished due to the risks of them falling into the wrong hands, as well as the potential to escalate to disastrous military action. Evidence supporting this stance includes Deepti Choubey's statement that there are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that could be used by terrorists, as well as Jonathan Herbach's warning that nuclear materials are not going away and more states are interested in developing them. Additionally, the threat of nuclear terrorism posed by ISIS and the risk of accidents, errors, irresponsible leadership, and hackers can lead to the use of nuclear weapons are all valid points. Ariel Conn's point that the threat of nuclear warfare is never the top priority further emphasizes the risk posed by nuclear weapons, as well as Max Tegmark and David Stanley's simulation of a nuclear attack that would cause 91 million casualties and the terrifying incident of lost contact with 50 missiles, respectively. Finally, Anthony Aguirre's reminder of the constellation of incidents surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis highlights how quickly tensions can escalate, and how lucky we were to survive the crisis. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that nuclear weapons should be abolished in order to minimize the risk of a devastating attack or terrorist activity."

    - Evidence 4: For example, they argue that industrialization supports greater efficiency of agriculture through technology, an advantage for the productivity of rural farmers as well as urban consumers..
    - Evidence 5: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Biodiversity will play an increasingly important role within the urban landscape..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
    - Evidence 3: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..

We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 3: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..

    - Evidence 2: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..

    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 3: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..

Given the topic of whether or not we should introduce compulsory voting, those opposing it have presented four arguments. The first argument is that abstention from voting is a form of expressing one's preference, and is a way to exercise one's right to vote. The second argument is that citizens have a right not to vote, and that compulsory voting is a breach of civil liberties. The third argument is that compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, which leads to the influence of money and spending on political campaigns. The fourth argument is that not everyone has the ability to go to vote due to a lack of knowledge or resources. Evidence has been provided for each of these claims, suggesting that compulsory voting is not necessarily a good idea."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study finds that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement in several ways..
    - Evidence 2: A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda by up to 20 percentage points..
    - Evidence 3: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Since voting at referendums in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory has been allowed in 1977, compulsory voting has also applied there..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
    - Evidence 3: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 3: A counter argument to opponents of compulsory voting is that in these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot..
    - Evidence 4: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 5: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..
","
In this debate, the topic being discussed is whether we should introduce compulsory voting. The positive side of this argument is in favour of introducing compulsory voting, based on three claims. The first claim is that compulsory voting increases representation, which is supported by evidence showing that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement, and increases electoral support for leftist policy positions. Additionally, it ensures that candidates have to address the needs of all voters, instead of skewing the political system towards the wealthy and well-educated. The second claim is that compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics, and evidence from the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory support this claim. The third claim is that people have an obligation to vote, which is supported by evidence from the European Court of Human Rights ruling that only attendance at a polling station is compulsory, and the fact that voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory. 

Overall, this debate concludes that introducing compulsory voting is a positive step that would lead to increased representation, political education and civic engagement."

Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
    - Evidence 2: Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs..
    - Evidence 3: The Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse..
    - Evidence 4: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..

    - Evidence 3: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 4: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..

    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: In 2001, the New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group stated that decriminalizing cannabis will result in greater availability of resources to respond to more serious crimes without any increased risks to public safety..
    - Evidence 3: Psychopharmacologist David Nutt argues, though he is against full declassification, that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco, which, if they were invented today would be illegal..
    - Evidence 4: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
    - Evidence 5: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
    - Evidence 3: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 3: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..

    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The Connecticut Law Revision Commission made the following evaluation: (1) the costs of arresting and prosecuting marijuana offenders were significantly lower in states that had done away with criminal penalties for possessing small amounts; (2) there was a greater increase in marijuana use in states that continue to treat possession as crime than in states that treated it as a civil offense; (3) easing the penalties for marijuana did not lead to a substantial increase in the use of either alcohol or hard drugs..
    - Evidence 2: The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many unintended negative consequences of drug enforcement..
    - Evidence 3: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
    - Evidence 4: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
    - Evidence 5: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.

The debate topic is 'We should legalize cannabis' and the stance is that it should be legalized. The first claim is that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal, which is supported by evidence such as a 2002 DAWN report, a 2001 New Mexico Drug Policy Advisory Group report, the statements of psychopharmacologist David Nutt and an argument that making cannabis legally available would reduce crime by shrinking the illicit market and by potentially reducing alcohol consumption. The second claim is that cannabis is financially beneficial, supported by evidence such as the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit report, a Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya report, and an argument that the removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act could save billions and generate billions in tax revenues. The third claim is that cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief, supported by evidence such as a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine's findings, and a letter from congressmen to the FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach. The fourth claim is that if cannabis was legalized it could be regulated, supported by evidence such as British Crime Survey statistics and an explanation of how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control from Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel. The fifth claim is that legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity, supported by evidence such as a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, the Connecticut Law Revision Commission, and the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime. The sixth claim is that people should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies, which is supported by the philosophy of John Stuart Mill, who argued that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society. 

Overall, this debate material argues that legalizing cannabis should be considered for a variety of reasons, such as the fact that alcohol and tobacco, which are more harmful than cannabis, remain legal, and that cannabis is financially beneficial and provides health and pain relief benefits. Additionally, legalizing cannabis could help reduce black-market/criminal activity and allow individuals to do whatever they want to their own bodies."

The topic of the debate is ""We should legalize prostitution"". The stance taken in the debate is against the legalization of prostitution, as its opponents are providing arguments and evidence to prove why prostitution should not be legalized. 

One of the arguments presented against the legalization of prostitution is that it will lead to an increase in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. This is supported by Evidence 1 which states that a survey in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; and by Evidence 2 which states that in Africa, encounters with prostitutes produce 84% of new HIV infections in adult males. Moreover, Evidence 3 states that registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes; and Evidence 4 states that some studies of prostitution in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population. 

The second argument is that legalizing prostitution will lead to an increase in immoral behaviour such as pimping, organized crime and trafficking. This is supported by Evidence 1 which states that the legalisation of prostitution will result in an increase in human trafficking and crime; and by Evidence 2 which states that many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps, and Evidence 3 which states that the United Nations reported that 79% of human trafficking is for prostitution. Moreover, Evidence 4 states that in the Netherlands, two Labour Party councillors found that a large number of prostitutes were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs; and Evidence 5 states that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime.

The third argument is that legalizing prostitution will lead to an increase in violence against women. This is supported by Evidence 1 which states that physical violence against prostitutes is extremely high, particularly among female sex workers; and by Evidence 2 which states that in a study of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, 70% of them had traumatizing experiences of physical violence, 40% of which were involved in prostitution; and by Evidence 3 which states that a survey of female sex workers in Leeds, England, and Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland, revealed that 47% had been victims of crime, including rape and robbery, while 36% had received threatening texts, telephone calls or emails. Additionally, Evidence 4 states that 11% had been raped and 22% had experienced an attempted rape; and Evidence 5 states that research has found substantial evidence that there is a correlation between pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence.

Finally, the fourth argument is that selling one's body is immoral. This is supported by Evidence 1 which states that some feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client, putting her in a subordinate position."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
    - Evidence 2: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The World Charter for Prostitutes Rights (1985), drafted by the International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights, calls for the decriminalisation of all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decision. Since the mid-1970s, sex workers across the world have organised, demanding the decriminalisation of prostitution, equal protection under the law, improved working conditions, the right to pay taxes, travel and receive social benefits such as pensions..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 3: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
    - Evidence 4: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
    - Evidence 5: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent..
    - Evidence 2: The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person. Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry..
    - Evidence 3: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
    - Evidence 4: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear..
    - Evidence 2: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 3: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 4: Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution in toto, there is some evidence that regulation of China's recreational venues has helped to create a legitimate female service worker with the right to refuse to engage in practices repugnant to the valid labour contract, as well as the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace..
    - Evidence 5: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
    - Evidence 2: For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word prostitution to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term criminal sexual acts..
    - Evidence 3: Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will. Most women make this decision themselves..
    - Evidence 4: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 5: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..

Debate Summary:
The topic of this debate is 'We should legalize prostitution'. Supporters of the topic argue that legalizing prostitution would boost the economy, increase sex workers' benefits, allow the profession to be regulated, make it safer for women, and give them the right to choose their bodies. Examples of evidence include a court ruling in Amsterdam, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard in Seattle, The World Charter for Prostitutes Rights, Alexandra Oliveira's ethnographical research, The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour, a study from 1995 in two brothels, and Mariska Majoor's views. Decriminalizing sex work would also grant the same rights to sex workers as other self-employed people, provide them with social benefits, and help to make prostitution safer for all involved. All in all, legalizing prostitution would offer sex workers increased rights and safety, and reduce social stigma."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society . Charles Lockwood of Yale says, a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars..
    - Evidence 2: When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences..
    - Evidence 3: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
    - Evidence 4: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
    - Evidence 5: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son, while a deeply rooted son preference makes many families want a son..
    - Evidence 2: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
    - Evidence 3: In addition, primary care physicians voiced the concerns that sex selection led to invasive medical interventions in the absence of therapeutic indications, contributed to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex, and was not a solution to domestic violence..
    - Evidence 4: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
    - Evidence 5: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 3: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
    - Evidence 4: Under the tradition of son preference and the one-child policy, missing females in China are formed through sex-selective abortion, discrimination in care for females, and non-registration of girls at birth..
    - Evidence 5: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..

Given the topic 'We should legalize sex selection', opponents argue that sex selection can lead to gender imbalance, reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases and can create abortions/infanticide. Evidence in support of these claims shows that bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society. This gender imbalance can lead to social unrest and wars, as well as discriminatory behaviour against women in countries such as China and India. There, sex selection has led to a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio and a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences. Evidence also shows that son preference has resulted in neglect of girls and in some cases female infanticide, as well as sex-selective abortions. Opponents argue that sex selection should not be legalized due to its ethical and moral implications and its potential for reinforcing gender biases and stereotypes."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Most families opt for unisex stuffs for babies before they are born. From clothes to toys, the color of the crib to the various necessities and accessories, everything is gender neutral in most cases. With gender selection or knowing baby’s gender can help every family to buy gender specific items. This not only does away with the ambiguity but actually helps the baby to get the best stuff as well. There is also a financial aspect as after the birthing of a baby, the parents always spend money on items that are for a boy or girl respectively. Knowing the gender or choosing gender allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The economic advantage is not oft talked about but it is significant..
    - Evidence 3: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
    - Evidence 4: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 5: nan.

    - Evidence 1: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 4: There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire..
    - Evidence 5: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 3: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..

","
Summary: The debate topic is whether we should legalize sex selection, with positive supporters arguing that it is within the parents' freedom to select the sex of the child, it allows for better family planning, makes the family more happy and complete, and prevents diseases in the child as well as abortions or infanticide. Evidence presented includes that it helps fulfill the wishes of a desired gender, allows for smart shopping, can prevent gender-specific diseases from being passed onto a baby, provides the opportunity of raising the desired number of children, gives parents effective control over the number of children they want, and can prevent infanticide and abortions due to the preference for a certain gender."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In common usage, the phrase 'flag burning' refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest..
    - Evidence 2: In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7-2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:  In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth..
    - Evidence 3: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 5: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
    - Evidence 3: Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..

The debate topic is 'We should prohibit flag burning'. Those opposed to this stance argue that flag burning is an effective tool of expression and protest, and is justified due to the freedom of expression as granted in the First Amendment of the US Constitution. This was supported by the US Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in 1989 in favor of Gregory Johnson, who was charged with desecrating an American flag. The court found that Johnson's act of burning the flag was protected speech under the First Amendment, and the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, it can be argued that prohibiting flag burning would go against the right to freedom of expression."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Under the 1983 Turkish flag law, burning the flag is strictly forbidden, punishable by a prison sentence of three years..
    - Evidence 2: Chief Justice Warren wrote that while the First Amendment does protect freedom of speech, it does not protect all things that may extraneously be labeled 'symbolic speech.
    - Evidence 3: In Austria flag desecration is illegal under Â§248 Strafgesetzbuch..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Rehnquist argued that flag burning is no essential part of any exposition of ideas but rather the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 4: According to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","
In the given debate, the topic is 'We should prohibit flag burning'. The positive supporters of the claim believe that flags are important symbols that should be respected and that flag burning is an inflammatory act. To support the claim, they provide evidence such as Chief Justice Warren's opinion that First Amendment does not protect all things labeled 'symbolic speech', the 1983 Turkish flag law and the 2003 incident of Khalid leading a protest march and burning the American flag, which are all examples of flag desecration being considered an offensive gesture. In addition, the ordinance in Hong Kong prohibits using flags in advertisements or trademarks and publicly burning them. It is clear that prohibiting flag burning is necessary to protect the sanctity of national flags."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls and makes our communities safer and healthier. It is a human right and it is good for the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations. Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy. In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy..
    - Evidence 3: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
    - Evidence 4: Twenty-five years after the United Nations’ Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action pledged to take the necessary steps to “remove all obstacles to gender equality and the advancement and empowerment of women,” support for gender equality is strong around the globe. Across 34 countries surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 94% think it is important for women in their country to have the same rights as men, with 74% saying this is very important..
    - Evidence 5: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: As a health professional and a researcher, Mar Nagel found that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions. They have better social and communication skills than men, possess strong memory, are sophisticated and show precision and fast reaction and response time..
    - Evidence 3: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
    - Evidence 4: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
    - Evidence 5: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address..
    - Evidence 2: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 4: The more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed..
    - Evidence 5: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Nindl, et al. (p. 51, 2016), training programs increased the number of pull-ups that women were capable of, demonstrating that they could overcome their naturally smaller muscle mass. Additionally, their research found that women performed better than men in ultra-endurance, or the ability to physical endure for a given extended period of time. These studies suggest that women excel in some abilities, and that while men are indeed stronger as a physical typicality, there are exceptions and other ways that women can compete..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
    - Evidence 3: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 4: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
    - Evidence 2: In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty..
    - Evidence 3: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 4: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
    - Evidence 5: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
    - Evidence 2: Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country..
    - Evidence 3: While fewer women might achieve such levels, as Jon Soltz, notes: There are women who can meet these standards, and they have a right to compete..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements.

The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.

This debate addresses the topic of prohibiting women in combat. The opponents of this stance argue that women should be allowed in combat due to gender equality, women's impact on the economy, their skills in combat, unique strategies, capabilities in combat, and the ability to pass tests. They also point out that allowing women in combat has been seen to be beneficial for unit cohesion, security risks, discipline, and efficiency. With evidence from a variety of studies, wars, and organizations, it is clear that allowing women to choose to serve in combat is a necessary move in order to have the best possible forces for the job."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
    - Evidence 3: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
    - Evidence 4: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
    - Evidence 2: In an interview with CNN on January 4, Maj. General Robert Dees, the campaign chair for Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, said he didn’t think it was a good idea: “If you look at the population demographics, most women…cannot properly carry a 230-pound soldier—with a rucksack and combat vest on—off of the battlefield to save his life..
    - Evidence 3: While the majority of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves.  In addition, combat units engage in activities designed to suit men’s capabilities. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this..
    - Evidence 4: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
    - Evidence 5: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: While it may be a feel-good move for many progressives, the end result might well be to lower the standards for all troops and damage the quality of the military..
    - Evidence 2: Lower female standards also reinforce the belief that women cannot perform the same job as men, therefore making it difficult for women to earn the trust and confidence of their teammates..
    - Evidence 3: Inconvenient truth is that men and women have been each other’s most consistent distraction since the beginning of time. To pretend that we don’t know what will happen when men and women are thrown together for prolonged periods in emotionally intense situations defies common sense. Being overly academic and insufficiently adult about adult behavior isn’t just irresponsible but imperiling, and belies the deadly seriousness with which we should want combat units to perform..
    - Evidence 4: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
    - Evidence 5: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected..
    - Evidence 3: 1988 – The DoD convenes its Task Force on Women in the Military and adopts the “risk rule,” which excludes women from combat units or missions which risk exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture..
    - Evidence 4: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
    - Evidence 5: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
    - Evidence 2: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..

The debate is about whether women should be allowed to serve in combat roles. Proponents of this stance argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women due to their greater physical strength and ability to sustain physical fitness. This is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine and a yearlong Marine Corps study which found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units. Additionally, women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers which combat roles require. Women are also prone to distractions which can impact the functioning of the military, and lowering of physical standards to allow women in combat roles could damage the quality of the military. Instead, it is argued that women should serve in safer roles such as those in the Second World War which included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics, and nurses. Women should also be excluded from combat roles due to the warrior culture among men which equates women with weakness, and the risk of capture which may be accompanied by rape."

United Kingdom that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom .. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest..
    - Evidence 2: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..

    - Evidence 2: A study authorized by the Trilateral Commission in 1975 to examine the governability of American democracy found that the most notable new source of national power in 1970, as compared to 1950, was the national media, suggesting also that there was considerable evidence to suggest that the development of television journalism contributed to the undermining of governmental authority..
    - Evidence 3: Solutions journalism practitioners say the approach augments and complements the press' traditional watchdog role, presenting citizens with a more complete view of issues.

We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
    - Evidence 2: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 3: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
    - Evidence 4: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
    - Evidence 2: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 3: Rockets and spaceflight instruments do not assemble themselves. They are designed and built by people, who get paid. They are fabricated from components which have to be manufactured and then purchased. The community engaged in the space industry includes specialist scientists and engineers, designers, graphic artists and IT professionals, as well as a vast support system: HR, catering, cleaning, etc..
    - Evidence 4: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
    - Evidence 5: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
    - Evidence 2: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 3: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
    - Evidence 4: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
    - Evidence 3: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
    - Evidence 4: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..

The topic for this debate is 'We should subsidize space exploration'. The proponent argues that space exploration should be subsidized while opponents claim that it can be carried by the private sector, is expensive, ineffective and that there are more important issues to fund. In support of the proponent, evidence shows that the private sector has made significant progress in space travel, with companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin achieving key feats, and NASA turning to the private sector to develop the spacecraft for their Artemis mission. Moreover, the private sector and partnerships have the potential to rapidly expand space exploration, with the benefit of satellite technology already being experienced. Conversely, opponents suggest that space exploration is expensive, with rockets costing $10,000 per pound to put into orbit and a reputed cost of $20 million per head for space tourists. In addition, they argue that the money spent on space exploration could be better used elsewhere, such as to alleviate poverty or to fund other important issues. Therefore, it is clear that both proponents and opponents have compelling arguments, and it is up to the debaters to decide whether space exploration should be subsidized or not."
We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,gpt3,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe..
    - Evidence 3: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
    - Evidence 4: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
    - Evidence 5: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars..
    - Evidence 2: Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence..
    - Evidence 3: An artist’s concept of New Horizons during the spacecraft’s planned encounter with Pluto and its moon Charon. The craft’s miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and space plasma experiments would characterize the global geology and geomorphology of Pluto and Charon, map their surface compositions and temperatures, and examine Pluto’s atmosphere in detail..
    - Evidence 4: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
    - Evidence 5: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more. We're constantly evolving and finding new ways to add value..
    - Evidence 2: Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA’s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations..
    - Evidence 3: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 4: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Every year, about a thousand technical innovations generated in the space program find their ways into our earthly technology where they lead to better kitchen appliances and farm equipment, better sewing machines and radios, better ships and airplanes, better weather forecasting and storm warning, better communications, better medical instruments, better utensils and tools for everyday life..
    - Evidence 2: Space Exploration for the Survival of the Human Race.
    - Evidence 3: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
    - Evidence 4: Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites – which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path – to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns..
    - Evidence 5: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration of our solar system and distant galaxies in the furthest reaches of the Universe is important to top-level science and the answers to many fundamental scientific questions including formation of the Universe, the origin of Earth, Evolution of life, and the Existence of life beyond the Earth. Space robotics plays a critical role in the current and future space exploration missions, and enables mission-defined machines that are capable of surviving in the space environment, and performing exploration, assembly, construction, maintenance, or servicing tasks..
    - Evidence 2: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
    - Evidence 3: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..

Summary: The topic of the debate is 'We should subsidize space exploration'. Proponents of this argument make the claims that space exploration can help colonize resources/lands of other planets, improve science/technology, be financially beneficial, and is necessary for the future survival of humanity. Moreover, space exploration can unravel information about the universe. Evidence in favor of these claims includes that space colonies can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche, satellite imagery and climate data can help sectors like agriculture, space exploration can create jobs and jumpstart businesses, and space robotics can gather scientifically valuable data. All these claims are put forward to suggest that subsidizing space exploration can offer humanity significant benefits."
