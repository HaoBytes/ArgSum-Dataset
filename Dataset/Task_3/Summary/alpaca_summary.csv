Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
","Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence. As an ethical principle, it is wrong to take actions that have the primary purpose of ending a human life. Therefore, assisted suicide should not be legalised."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'. The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made..
- claim_3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text..
- claim_4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
","The evidence suggests that assisted suicide can be criminalized without infringing upon a person's right to self-determination, as it does not involve any immediate danger to life, limb, or health. The arguments presented above make the case that, while assisted suicide may be seen as beneficial in certain cases, it should not be criminalized, as it does not involve any immediate danger to life, limb, or health. Therefore, the evidence suggests that assisted suicide should not be criminalized."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The agency provides Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
","Homeschooling should be part of a broader solution to the issues of badness in schools. It should not be seen as a panacea, but rather as a tool to provide students with the best possible learning environment. Homeschooling is not an end in itself, but rather a means of giving students the opportunity to explore their own unique interests and develop their own educational paths. Homeschooling should be seen as part of a larger strategy to improve the quality of education in general. Homeschooling should not be seen as a replacement for public schools, but rather as a way to provide students with a more personalized learning experience. Homeschooling should be seen as a way to allow parents to provide their children with the best possible educational environment and to give them the autonomy to pursue their own interests."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..

Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'.
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Mayo Clinic states that natural infection 'often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.'.
","The evidence presented suggests that routine child vaccinations should not be mandatory. While vaccines can provide some benefits, such as providing immunity from certain diseases, the risks associated with mandatory vaccinations outweigh the potential benefits. Therefore, it is not necessary to make childhood vaccinations mandatory."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
","The routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to protect others. This is because it has been estimated that the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000 resulted in a 69% drop in the rate of invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. Furthermore, vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
",I would argue that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company. Regulating social media would lead to political abuses and a decrease in our democracy.
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
","We have seen that social media regulation is necessary to protect users from malicious users and prevent them from being victims of online harms. We have also seen that it can help deal with fake news, while providing users with insights into algorithms that can be manipulated by malicious actors. We concluded that it is vital to take immediate action to protect young audiences, and that a solid majority of the public supports such regulation. We must also recognize the value of a strong statutory framework to safeguard citizens from online harms, and that independent regulation is necessary to ensure user safety."
The USA is a good country to live in,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'The USA is a good country to live in', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The US has unfair health and education policies.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Additionally, at least six in ten Black adults (60%) and Hispanic adults (65%) report difficulty affording health care costs compared to about four in ten White adults (39%)..
- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: In this edition of the Poll, 65% of people in the USA said they were worried about violent crime as a threat to their safety, with a four-percentage-point increase (from 22% to 26%) in people feeling ‘very worried’ compared to 2019. This put worry about crime second to concern about road traffic collisions (73%)..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Nearly three in ten Asian Americans report experiencing racial slurs or jokes since the start of the pandemic, over 6,600 incidents of hate crime (including physical attacks on Asian elders) have been reported nationwide, and six women were murdered at three Asian-owned spas in Georgia in March 2021..

- claim_2: The US has a good health and education systems.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With some exceptions, US universities are highly regarded around the globe and candidates with US Diplomas have a better chance to be picked by Employers. In a survey for top universities in the world from 2014, 40 out of 100 universities are located in the U.S, 7 of which are in the top 10..
- claim_3: The US has a great environment/nature.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Famous conservationist and wilderness writer John Muir called Yosemite nature’s temple..
- claim_4: The US has freedoms/ democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Human Rights: The Essential Reference, 'the American Declaration of Independence was the first civic document that met a modern definition of human rights.'.
- claim_5: The US has great people/culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Nearly every region of the world has influenced American culture, most notably the English who colonized the country beginning in the early 1600s, according to the Library of Congress(opens in new tab). U.S. culture has also been shaped by the cultures of Indigenous Americans, Latin Americans, Africans and Asians..
- claim_6: The US is a powerful country.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The US has been ranked the world's most powerful country for the seventh time, according to the latest rankings by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and US News & World Report..
- claim_7: The US offers great opportunities for individuals.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: In terms of jobs in America, almost all of the biggest companies in the world have offices in the USA. You will have career opportunities in America you could not get anywhere else in the world. Just one internship for a big name could change your career..
","The US is a great country to live in, with a high standard of living, positive people, and plenty of opportunities for individuals. It has a powerful economy, with some of the best universities in the world, top companies, and plenty of job opportunities. Its culture is vibrant and diverse, with plenty to see and do."
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
",I will add background information to the debate.
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
","Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature and should be discouraged. In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck, american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage.

We should abandon marriage,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
","We should reject the idea that marriage should be abandoned. Marriage is important for people, and has many benefits for both adults and children. In addition, it has financial advantages for those who are married and those who cohabit. Therefore, we should strive to maintain strong marriages and support healthy relationships."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
","1. Marriage is seen as a way to ensure stability and harmony in a relationship. 
 2. In many cultures, marriages are encouraged and even subsidized by the government. 
 3. There is ample evidence to suggest that marriages can be beneficial to both partners, leading to higher levels of stability, trust and understanding. 
 4. Women in marriages often report higher levels of satisfaction and fulfilment."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..

    - Evidence 1: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
","We should abolish capital punishment because it does not deter crime, and may even lead to more murders. Executions do not act as a deterrent, and can lead to more murders. In addition, the death penalty is cruel and inhumane, and it should be abolished."

- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..

A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.

Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:

- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,.
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","Claim 1: We should adopt an austerity regime.

- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:

- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
","We should adopt atheism since it is the most moral position. Atheism is the belief that there is no God, and that we should not follow any religious rules. It is the most moral position because it demands that we use reason and evidence to come to our own conclusions, and encourages us to think for ourselves. Atheism leads to a more moral society, since it encourages us to use reason and evidence to come to our own conclusions. We must be free to think for ourselves, instead of blindly following the rules of a religion."

- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.

For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
","We should adopt libertarianism because it increases individual freedom and happiness. This is because it allows individuals to make their own decisions and pursue their own goals without interference from the government. Furthermore, it is consistent with the view that individuals should be free to live their lives as they choose, and that this increases their overall happiness."

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.

    - Evidence 1: FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child..
","We should not ban human cloning, as it has potential medical benefits. Cloning can help us understand our biological nature and the mysteries of life. It can provide essential medical knowledge that could help us make ethical decisions about our future. Cloning also has the potential to help us understand human nature better and to make more meaningful connections with one another.

    - Evidence 1: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
","We should not ban the use of child actors, as they bring valuable experience and skills to the entertainment industry. They also have the potential to become successful individuals in other fields, such as education and politics. While it is true that child performers often face a lot of pressure and have to cope with difficult working conditions, it is important to remember that a ban on child actors would have a detrimental effect on the entertainment industry and prevent them from acquiring valuable skills and experiences."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
",We have already discussed the advantages of Guantanamo Bay detention camp over other options. The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is a state-of-the-art facility for gaining intelligence that cannot be replicated anywhere else.

- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..

    - Evidence 1: The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.

    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.

    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
","The Guantanamo Bay detention camp remains an expensive and embarrassing symbol of US disregard for the rule of law. Evidence supporting the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp includes the findings of the US Supreme Court in the case of Boumediene v.

    - Evidence 1: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..

- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
","We should end affirmative action, as it perpetuates prejudice and reduces quality. It is unfair to discriminate against people based on their race or gender, and does not address the root cause of the problem. Furthermore, it does not help the individuals who are actually affected by the discrimination, but rather harms them further by placing them at a disadvantage compared to those who are not."

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
","We should support the idea that cities offer more opportunities. This is because urbanization leads to an increased influx of capital, which in turn encourages businesses to invest in green technologies, creating new jobs and stimulating economic growth.

We should fight urbanization,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: MÄori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
","Venezuela is an example of a country severely affected by urbanization, with its rural areas struggling to cope with the consequences of depopulation, migration and environmental degradation. 
 
  The solution proposed is to reduce migration, and limit the number of people living in the urban areas. This could be achieved through encouraging people to move to rural areas with better living standards, or by providing incentives to employers to hire local workers and limit the number of foreigners coming to the cities. Additionally, the government could invest in green initiatives and infrastructure, as well as provide free education and healthcare to reduce poverty and mitigate the negative effects of overurbanization."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
- claim_4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..
","We should introduce compulsory voting in order to ensure that everyone's voice is heard. Not everyone has the ability to go out and vote, so compulsory voting would allow those who cannot attend in person to still have their voices heard. Voting is a crucial part of a healthy democracy and should not be taken lightly. Compulsory voting should be encouraged in order to ensure that everyone's voice is heard and to protect against the potential for voting abuse.
- claim_5: Compulsory voting should be encouraged in order to protect against potential voting abuse.
- claim_6: Compulsory voting should be introduced in order to protect against potential voting abuse. 
 

### Conclusion:
We should introduce compulsory voting in order to protect against potential voting abuse."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
","The European Court of Human Rights has long held that compulsory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, as attendance at a polling station is compulsory while voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot.  The ruling in 1971 held that âthe only conceivable way of ensuring that citizens are able to enjoy their right to vote is to make voting compulsory.â  Thus, the Court found that the right to vote âimplies the correlative obligation of citizens to exercise that right.â  In other words, while voting is compulsory, it is not obligatory to cast a ballot - the voter has the choice of either attending a polling station or abstaining from voting.  Thus, the option of abstaining from voting is a valid alternative to attending a polling station. 

Furthermore, the European Court of Human Rights has also ruled that âthe only conceivable way of ensuring that citizens are able to exercise their right to vote is to make voting compulsory.â  Thus, the Court's 1971 decision upholds the right to abstain from voting as a valid alternative to attending a polling station.  It follows that compulsory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, as abstaining from voting is a valid alternative to attending a polling station.

We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
- claim_5: Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Take California for example: first in the nation to legalize the medical use of the drug in 1996, the state would go on to legalize recreational use in 2016. But in just the past year, the state reported several massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza – just over the last three or four months..

We should legalize cannabis,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..
","1. Cannabis is not as dangerous as alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, such as heroin and cocaine. 
  2. Cannabis is not as addictive as heroin and cocaine.
  3. Cannabis is not as harmful as heroin and cocaine.
  4. Cannabis use does not lead to brain damage, such as does heroin and cocaine.

We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..
","1. We should legalize prostitution because it will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
2. We should not legalize prostitution because it will increase violence against women.
3. We should not legalize prostitution because it is immoral and reduces the woman to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
","The proponents of decriminalization are right, and the evidence suggests that legalization of sex work would be beneficial for all."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
","We should legalize sex selection because it can lead to gender imbalance, which is a concern in certain regions of India and China, but not in the majority of the country. In addition, it can also result in abortions/infanticide, which is not desirable. Thus, legalizing sex selection is not the best solution."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
","Sex selection is the practice of choosing the gender of a baby in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked diseases. It allows parents to choose the sex of their baby, either a son or daughter, in order to fulfill their preference for a healthy infant."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..

We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
",We should allow women to serve in combat if they choose to and if they pass the tests.
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
","Women should be prohibited from serving in combat roles. This is because they lack the physical strength and mental fortitude to perform such roles, and their presence can be a distraction and hinder performance. Furthermore, the IDF noted that fewer than 4% of women are in such roles, indicating that women are not adequately represented in such positions."

We need journalism to keep powerful people in check and to provide citizens with the information they need to make well-informed choices.

Journalism is not just a business - it is essential for democracy, for without it we cannot make informed decisions.

The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
","We should prioritize funding for poverty eradication, healthcare, education, and other pressing issues, given that space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now."
We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
","Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', the positive supporters of this claim are that space exploration can help in colonizing the resources of other planets, while providing new homelands and an expanded ecological niche. In addition, space exploration can generate clean energy and enable scientific discoveries, which will contribute to humanity's survival in the 21st century."
We should subsidize vocational education,-1.0,alpaca,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize vocational education', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education can divert money from other important programs, such as early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education..
- claim_2: subsidizing vocational education is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Center for American Progress in 2018 found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be expensive, as many programs require significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty..
- claim_3: subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The study found that a large-scale subsidy program for vocational education in Germany led to a significant increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs. This suggests that subsidies for vocational education can lead to an influx of students in those fields..
- claim_4: vocational education is not a good career choice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the National Center for Education and the Economy in 2014 found that many vocational education programs offer limited transferability of skills, making it difficult for workers to transition to new careers or industries, even when job opportunities change..
","We should not subsidize vocational education, as it is an expensive policy and can lead to an influx of students in those fields."

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
","The opponents of the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence' argue that allowing assisted suicide could lead to abuse and exploitation of vulnerable people. They argue that current law must provide safeguards to protect those who want to end their life, and that assisted suicide can never be made available to those who are not mentally competent. They also argue that allowing assisted suicide could lead to 'cheapening' of human life, by devaluing it and making it a commodity.
  Evidence supporting the opponents' argument:
    - Evidence 1: Allowing assisted suicide could lead to abuse and exploitation of vulnerable people, who may be pressured into ending their life.
    - Evidence 2: Current law does not provide safeguards to protect those who want to end their life, and may lead to 'cheapening' of human life by devaluing it and making it a commodity."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'. The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made..
- claim_3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dr. Lynda Young, MD, stated her opposition when she said, 'Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'.
- claim_4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
","Assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be allowed because many times people can get better even without assistance and it is not fair to ask someone to die just because they are depressed.
 
 12. The Dutch Medical Association is opposed to physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, as they maintain that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient wishes to have it done or not. 
 13. Assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be allowed, as the Netherlands Medical Association opposes it due to its unethical nature. 
 14. People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help."

- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
","Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Home schooling creates a more personalized learning environment with fewer restrictions and offers a wider range of activities to engage children. It gives them more freedom to explore their interests and develop their own skills. 
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent survey, the majority of American parents already favor home schooling, with 86% claiming it to be a better option than public education.

    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling offers more flexibility and personalization to accommodate individual needs than a typical classroom. 
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling is also seen as a more efficient way of learning as it allows for a narrower focus on a student's interests, as well as giving them more time to explore their own passions and develop their own skills. 
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling is a better option for children with special needs, as it offers them a more secure and tailored learning environment adapted to their individual needs and interests."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
","Evidence 1: Homeschooling opponents argue that the lack of regulation puts children at risk, as there is no way to ensure that parents are qualified to do the teaching, and that children may be abused if there is no oversight.
  Evidence 2: Public school is essential for children because it can provide the depth and breadth of educational opportunities that homeschooling cannot. It also provides the social interaction that children need to develop their social skills, which are invaluable in life. Homeschooling is not only risky, but also expensive, as it requires additional resources and oversight that public school does not."

- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:

- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
","We can add evidence to support the claim that government regulation of social media is not effective. For example, we can add evidence that the implementation of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation has been ineffective in protecting user privacy."

We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.

Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.

- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
"," Evidence supporting this response:
  - Evidence 1: The Catholic Church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found that obligatory celibacy for Catholic priests may have contributed to instances of child sexual abuse. 
  - Evidence 2: The Council recommended that priests undergo âpsycho-sexual developmentâ training to better equip them to identify and respond to situations of child sexual abuse. 
  - Claim 7: The Church must take action to protect children from abuse.
  - Evidence 1: The Catholic Church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia recommended that the Church develop âsafe environmentâ policies and procedures to protect children from abuse."

- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the wake of the clergy sexual abuse scandals, some critics have charged that priestly celibacy was a contributing factor.
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy..
","The vow of celibacy should be abandoned because it is unnatural and pressuring. It leads to wrong sexual behaviour and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Furthermore, it goes against the natural instincts of reproduction and survival."

    - Evidence 1: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
","The opponents' argument is that marriage is important for people. 
  Evidence supporting the opponents' argument: 
    - People who are married are more satisfied with their relationships and trust each other more than those who are living together without getting married. 
  Evidence refuting the opponents' argument:
    - People who are married are more likely to get divorced than those living together without getting married. 
  Evidence supporting the opponents' argument:
    - People who are married are more likely to attend college, are less likely to use drugs or alcohol, and are less likely to become pregnant or impregnate someone else.

We should abandon marriage,1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
","Evidence 1: A growing body of research shows that a monogamous relationship is mutually beneficial. 
 
  Evidence 2: Studies indicate that marital intimacy is associated with greater happiness, improved mental health, and even better physical health. 
 
  Evidence 3: Monogamy has been found to reduce the risk of sexually-transmitted infections, as well as providing protection against STDs.

 
  Evidence 4: In addition, it has been shown that monogamy reduces the risk of domestic violence, as well as increasing the likelihood of a couple staying together.
 
 
  Evidence 5: Studies also suggest that monogamy decreases the likelihood of divorce.
 
 
  Evidence 6: In addition, monogamy has been associated with higher levels of relationship satisfaction.
 
 
  Evidence 7: Monogamy has even been found to increase the likelihood of a couple staying together.
 
 
  Evidence 8: In addition, it has been suggested that monogamy increases the probability of a couple staying together."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..

    - Evidence 1: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","We should abandon the use of school uniforms because they are expensive, make learning difficult, and harm individuality."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","We should abolish capital punishment. Despite its proponentsâ claims that it deters crime, the evidence shows that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent and can cause more harm than good. It can lead to an increase in murder rates and does not have a significant deterrent effect on crime. Instead, we should focus on rehabilitation and invest in prevention strategies to reduce crime in the long-term."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
","We should abolish the death penalty because it is an irreversible punishment, it does not deter crime, and it is not cost effective."

- claim_3: Intellectual property rights are unfair.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Roderick T. Long argues that the concept of intellectual property is not libertarian. He holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
- claim_4: Intellectual property rights harm creativity/innovation.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:

- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For today’s gun owners, the right to own guns nearly rivals other rights laid out in the U.S. Constitution in terms of its personal salience. About three-quarters of gun owners (74%) say this right is essential to their own sense of freedom..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
","The opponents' argument is that gun ownership is not effective in reducing gun deaths. The evidence supports this claim, as the data from the 2016 Gallup survey shows that gunownership is not associated with a decrease in firearm deaths. Additionally, the opponents' argument that gun ownership promotes self-protection is not supported by the data, as only 63% of gun owners cite personal safety as the reason for owning a firearm."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: “For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
"," Evidence 1: The UK's employment rate has fallen from 7.6 per cent in 2007 to 5.3 per cent in 2014. The US's employment rate has also declined from 5.7 per cent in 2007 to 5.4 per cent in 2014. Unsurprisingly, the OECD average unemployment rate has risen from 4.5 per cent in 2007 to 5.6 per cent in 2014, while the UK's jobless rate has grown from 3.6 per cent in 2007 to 4.5 per cent in 2014."

    - Evidence 1: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..

    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
","The government of Ireland implemented an austerity regime which included spending cuts and tax increases to reduce its deficit. The government of the United States implemented an austerity policy with tax increases and spending cuts to reduce its deficit. Both governments experienced a decrease in their unemployment rates, but the US unemployment rate remained higher than the Irish rate. This suggests that the US austerity policy was more successful than Ireland's, as the US unemployment rate dropped below Ireland's."
We should adopt atheism,-1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..
- claim_2: Atheism lacks morality.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life..
- claim_3: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..
","We should adopt atheism in order to guarantee freedom of religion. Atheism does not violate any rights and does not limit freedoms, it only promotes them. It is essential to have a free and open society, in which people are free to choose any religion or belief. Atheism is the foundation of such a society. Atheism is not just another religion, it is a lifestyle that promotes moral values and encourages people to be responsible and accountable for their choices."

- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
",We should adopt atheism since it is the most beneficial religion that anyone can follow.
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
","In conclusion, I would argue that the best way to evaluate a policy is to consider its outcomes, rather than its intentions. Too often, libertarians have argued for policies that sound good in theory, but actually lead to bad outcomes. By contrast, we can evaluate policies by their outcomes, rather than their intentions. In this way, we can make sure that policies actually lead to the best outcomes."

- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to freely associate with others, a libertarian system can promote greater cooperation, understanding, and social support. For example, sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
","Claim 1: We should adopt a more libertarian view of the world.
  Evidence supporting claim 1: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Rothbard, argue that reducing taxation is essential for economic growth and for increasing individual freedom.
 
Claim 2: Property rights are essential for ensuring individual freedom.
  Evidence supporting claim 2: By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control their own property, libertarians argue that it increases freedom in the political and economic spheres.
 
Claim 3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim 3: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Putnam, argue that social networks and community involvement are essential for promoting happiness."

For example, cloning can be used to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments for those diseases. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:

- claim_3: Cloning promotes health.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of infertility and to develop new therapies to treat infertility. A study by the Fertility and Sterility journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the processes of reproduction..
- claim_4: Cloning promotes science/research.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:

    - Evidence 1: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2001, when Germany and France proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an international convention to ban reproductive human cloning, the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included Spain, Philippines, the United States, and Costa Rica, noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report published by the Council of Europe in 2008 discussed the potential for abuse of cloning technology and recommended measures to ensure that cloning is used for medical purposes only..
","We should ban human cloning, since it is unethical and unsafe. Cloning is not understood enough, and it is not safe to be done. It should be banned since it is not ethical and it can lead to serious consequences. We should take measures to ensure that cloning is only done for medical purposes, and never for recreational purposes. In addition, we should make sure that cloning is not done in secret and that it is never done for personal gain. Moreover, we should also ensure that cloning is not done in secret and that it is never done for personal gain."

    - Evidence 1: Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..

    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
"," We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons because they are essential for protection and deterrence. 
 
  The opponent's argument is that deterrence is not only a strategy to prevent an actor from taking specific action, but also a core principle that has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years.  This is a clear example of circular logic, as the opponent's argument is that deterrence is essential for preventing an actor from taking specific action, while the evidences presented in support of the claim are actually meant to demonstrate why deterrence is important. This type of circular logic is known as a ""slippery slope"" argument. 
 
  Evidence 1: Deterrence is an effective strategy for keeping peace. 
  In support of the claim that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons, Evidence 1 argues that deterrence is essential for preventing an actor from taking specific action and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years.

    - Evidence 1: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..

    - Evidence 1: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: What is certain is that the crime rate certainly rose during the period of industrialisation, particularly in towns and cities..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Surveys showed that urbanization and coastal development, especially from tourism and agricultural sectors, contributed to increased degradation of the marine environment in the area..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and good-quality touristic services, so the fast process of urbanization, had the consequence of irregular neighbourhoods..
","The issue of whether to fight urbanization is still debated. Despite the fact that it is hard to find a consensus on the effects of urbanization, the evidence suggests that the process of urbanization can have both positive and negative impacts on the environment. On the one hand, it can lead to the growth of towns and cities and provide economic benefits to their residents. On the other hand, it can cause strain on the natural resources and environment, especially in coastal areas. The evidence suggests that the process of urbanization can result in the degradation of the environment, with increased crime rate, and the displacement of rural population."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
- claim_4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..
","We should introduce compulsory voting. 
 
  Evidence supporting this:
  - Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, abstains from voting, or votes for the losing candidate, all of these actions endorse the same rule of the Blackstone doctrine. Consequently, introducing compulsory voting may be beneficial in order to increase civic engagement and awareness. By requiring citizens to cast their ballot, citizens may become more informed and engaged in the democratic process."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
"," Evidence supporting claim_1: Compulsory voting means that candidates win more seats in parliament. This is because, in countries with compulsory voting, the well-off and well-educated people tend to win the majority of seats. In countries like Thailand, where voting is compulsory, candidates win with much less of the eligible vote. Therefore, compulsory voting is a feasible solution to the problem of unequal representation."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..

    - Evidence 1: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..
","Evidence 1: The legalization of cannabis could reduce the harms of the black market and criminal activity associated with it, based on a study published in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy.

- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence..
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..
","We should not legalize prostitution because it will lead to more immoral behavior like pimping and trafficking. The opponents of this view argue that legalizing prostitution will increase violence against women, as it puts them in a subordinate position. However, the proponents of this view argue that legalizing prostitution will not increase violence against women, as it puts women in a mutual and equal sex act, which they can enjoy and take part in on their own terms. Thus, the debate remains inconclusive."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..

- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..

- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..

We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team.

- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
","The evidence presented suggests that allowing women in combat roles could potentially be detrimental to the functioning of the military. 

The arguments presented above support the conclusion that allowing women in combat roles could be potentially detrimental to the functioning of the military. While there is evidence to suggest that women may perform well in certain roles, it is clear that these roles require a unique set of skills that may be difficult for women to maintain. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that allowing women in combat roles could lead to a decrease in overall military effectiveness.  Thus, we must conclude that women should not be allowed in combat roles."

We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,alpaca,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..

- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:

- claim_2: subsidizing vocational education is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be limited by the ability to scale, as many programs may not have the resources or infrastructure to serve large numbers of students..
- claim_3: subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The study analyzed the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany and found that the subsidies led to an increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs. This suggests that subsidies for vocational education can influence student choice and lead to an influx in those fields..
- claim_4: vocational education is not a good career choice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 2: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
    - Evidence 2: In 2002, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide. This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
    - Evidence 2: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
","Evidence 1: Active euthanasia (i.e. assisted suicide) is not taking place in all countries; in many cases, it is not even an option.
  Evidence 2: In 2002, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide.
  Evidence 3: In Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, physician-assisted suicide is also an option.
  Evidence 4: In the US, assisted suicide is not legal in all states.

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text..
    - Evidence 2: The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient..
- claim_2: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: In 1997, in the cases of Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it..
- claim_3: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
    - Evidence 2: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
","Assisted suicide is not a fundamental right, and its practice will inevitably lead to involuntary euthanasia, which is not accepted in society.  Therefore, assisted suicide should remain a criminal offence."

- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.

    - Evidence 1: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
    - Evidence 2: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..

Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 2: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 2: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 2: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
","Homeschooling has many potential drawbacks, and while it may seem attractive in theory, the practicalities of actually implementing it show it to be far more difficult than it first appears. It requires a lot of dedication and resources, and can potentially do more harm than good. It is not suitable for every family, as there are many potential risks and drawbacks involved. Ultimately, the decision to homeschool should be left to the individual family, as there are many potential advantages and disadvantages involved."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
    - Evidence 2: The CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, and a “small possibility” exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disorder in which the person’s immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system, in about one or two per million people vaccinated..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'.
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as in the European Convention on Human Rights..
","The opponents of this debate have failed to provide any evidence to support their argument.  They have not provided any evidence that contradicts the statement that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. Therefore, the opponents' argument is unpersuasive."

- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
    - Evidence 2: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 2: The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that vaccination prevents 3.5–5 million deaths per year, and up to 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination.
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 2: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
    - Evidence 2: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
","Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to protect others. 
 
  Evidence supporting this: 
  - Evidence 1: Vaccine hesitancy often leads to disease outbreaks and deaths, as seen with the 2012 pertussis outbreak. 
  - Evidence 2: Vaccine hesitancy is one of the top ten global health threats, according to the World Health Organization."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
    - Evidence 2: The groups wrote that, 'The FTC’s failure to enforce its order has resulted in the unlawful transfer of [87] million user records … [i]t is unconscionable that the FTC allowed this unprecedented disclosure of Americans’ personal data to occur. The FTC’s failure to act imperils not only privacy but democracy as well.'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
    - Evidence 2: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
    - Evidence 2: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
    - Evidence 2: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
    - Evidence 2: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..
","The government must not intervene in the affairs of a private company, as this can lead to political abuses.
 
  Evidence 1: In the U.S., the Trump administration has sought to influence 2016 election results through dark advertisements, according to the New York Times.
 
  Evidence 2: In the UK, the prime minister has misused weather reports to promote his own political agenda, according to the Guardian.

Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
    - Evidence 2: The European Union reached a deal on Saturday on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 2: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 2: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
","Input: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Output: Social media regulation can help to curb malicious activities by forcing companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content and other malicious activities."

Essays perceived to be written by Black or Latino students were given more praise and less guidance on how to improve their writing..
- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:

    - Evidence 1: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
    - Evidence 2: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
    - Evidence 2: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..
    - Evidence 2: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..

    - Evidence 2: A range of scholars from at least the late 19th century to the present have produced arguments that white supremacy exists in U.S. school curriculum, oftentimes to the detriment of non-White students Americans' learning outcomes and the whole of American society..
",Claims supported by the evidence presented: The US has a problematic political culture and high taxation/cost of living. Its people are also more likely to feel unsafe and less respected than before.

    - Evidence 2: In a column for National Review, Joseph Sullivan compares recent increases in living standards for major nations'If you want to answer questions about how economic wellbeing for individuals in a country has evolved, the actual change in the value of real GDP per capita may tell you more than the rate of its change. Why? Individuals buy goods and services with dollars and cents — not the rates of change that economists, politicians, and pundits tend to focus on when it comes to growth. …By this metric, between 2016 and 2019, economic growth in the U.S. was the best in its class. …The U.S. surpasses…its peers…by no small margin.

    - Evidence 2: Our right to gather in peaceful public protest – in marches, rallies and other assemblies – is another core freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment. As a First Amendment scholar says in this overview, 'First Amendment freedoms ring hollow if government officials can repress expression that they fear will create a disturbance or offend.

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 2: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 2: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 2: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.

    - Evidence 2: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 2: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
    - Evidence 2: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
","Celibacy is an important part of a priest's life, and it should be maintained. Religious experiences and traditions should be preserved, and celibacy should be upheld as an important part of a priest's life."

- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)..
    - Evidence 2: George T. Dennis SJ of Catholic University of America says: 'There is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.' Peter Fink SJ agrees, saying that underlying premises used in the book, Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy, 'would not stand up so comfortably to historical scrutiny'. Dennis says this book provides no evidence that celibacy had apostolic origins..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
    - Evidence 2: Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
    - Evidence 2: Ignoring his vow of celibacy, Urbain Grandier is known to have had sexual relationships with a number of women and to have acquired a reputation as a philanderer..

We should abandon marriage,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
    - Evidence 2: Moreover, a 2010 CDC study on child well-being and family structure shows that children from homes with married parents did better in every category..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 2: But while cohabitation is on the rise, data from Pew and other sources continue to show that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships. The marriage happiness premium extends to nearly every aspect of a couple's relationship, with one notable exception: their sex lives..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 2: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult. About eight-in-ten married adults (78%) say they feel closer to their spouse than to any other adult in their life; a narrower majority of cohabiters (55%) say the same about their partner..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
    - Evidence 2: One of the most significant advantages of marriage is eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits. First, as a married couple, you're each eligible to collect your own Social Security benefit or up to 50 percent of your spouse's benefit, whichever is greater. This can be a financial plus if one of you is a higher earner..
","Evidence supporting the claim that we should abandon marriage: 
  - Evidence 1: Marriage makes people happier, with higher levels of relationship satisfaction and lower levels of conflict.
  - Evidence 2: But there is a cost to getting hitched, as wedded couples may be eligible for fewer tax breaks than those living together.
  - Evidence 3: Moreover, marriages that end in divorce can cost couples more than those who stay together.
  - Evidence 4: Finally, the costs of raising a family can be higher for those who marry, as childrearing expenses can be double what those who do not wed have to shoulder alone."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
    - Evidence 2: Millions of girls around the world experience female genital mutilation (FGM) as a prerequisite to marriage or as a means to control a woman’s sexuality before marriage. This is an infringement on a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy, and as it is often performed on school-aged girls, also stops them from being able to access education and deprives them of their childhood, as well as causing both short- and long-term health consequences..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 2: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","We may find that the best way to secure marital stability is through shared understanding, respect and compromise. This includes the ability to reasonably address disagreements, to prioritise each otherâs needs and to invest time and effort in rebuilding relationships. It may require us to learn how to better negotiate our relationships and to value each otherâs perspectives. We may find this is more effective than simply expecting one partner to shoulder all the responsibility or to make all the sacrifices. It may be that better communication and understanding may be the most important ingredient in a happy relationship."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 2: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 2: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
    - Evidence 2: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
","Evidence 1: Students in uniforms feel more connected to their school and are more likely to take pride in their appearance, as evidenced by a recent Texas study. 
  Evidence 2: School uniforms can save parents up to Â£113 per child, as evidenced by UK research. 
  Evidence 3: School uniforms encourage discipline and focus in the classroom, as evidenced by a recent Texas study. 
  Evidence 4: School uniforms can save parents up to Â£180 per child, as evidenced by UK research."

- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
    - Evidence 2: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 2: Based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
    - Evidence 2: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
    - Evidence 2: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
    - Evidence 2: This idea is supported by testimony from a 17-year-old student forced to wear uniforms. Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..

Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..

Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect.

Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums.

We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..

Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 2: In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime..
","The death penalty should be abolished because it is both inhumane and ineffective. It does not deter crime, it is applied unfairly, and it costs taxpayers too much money."

    - Evidence 2: Murray Rothbard argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain..

A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..

- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and “89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence.”.
","We must take action on gun control in order to protect our citizens and reduce the risk of gun deaths. Banning guns is an effective way to reduce gun violence and save lives. Gun control can include background checks, waiting periods, and other measures to ensure that only law abiding citizens can access firearms."

Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed..

Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
    - Evidence 2: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 2: For example, Canada in 1993-96, cut their fiscal deficit but maintained strong economic growth..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 2: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
    - Evidence 2: Countries use austerity measures to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. That's when creditors become concerned that the country will default on its debt. It occurs when the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is greater than 77%..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 2: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.

    - Evidence 2: As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film The Golden Compass, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be watered down from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says denigrates Christianity and promotes atheism for kids, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief..
- claim_2: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..

We should adopt atheism,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: La Mettrie defended a purely pleasure-based view of the proper end of human life, and advocated atheism as the only means of liberating human beings from the various forms of oppression which stand in the way of human progress..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
","We should not adopt atheism since it is not possible to prove that God exists. Even if we grant atheism for the sake of argument, it is not clear that atheists have the upper hand in moral debates. Atheism is not a superior basis for ethics, since it cannot provide any basis for the kinds of value judgments that are necessary for moral decision making. We can never know if an atheist moral perspective is the best one, since it does not provide us with any objective means to make moral judgments. To make an atheist moral perspective the foundation of ethics is to beg the question, since it does not provide us with any objective means to decide between alternative courses of action.

While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 2: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
","Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting essential human rights, such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly.
 
  Evidence 2: The government also has an essential role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions.
 
  Evidence 3: Without the government, essential human rights and the environment cannot be protected.
 
  Evidence 4: Without the government, essential human rights and the environment cannot be defended or protected.
 
  Evidence 5: Therefore, the government is essential for protecting essential human rights and the environment.
 
 
 ### Output:
The government is essential for protecting essential human rights and the environment."
We should adopt libertarianism,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism increases economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Sustainability advocates Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins posited in their book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
    - Evidence 2: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
","We have seen that libertarianism, by reducing the role of government intervention, increases both individual freedom and economic growth. It follows that libertarianism is the best political system, as it maximizes individual freedom and leads to greater economic growth."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility..

- claim_3: Cloning promotes health.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For example, scientists could use cloning to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases. A study by the Nature journal found that cloning could greatly advance stem cell research..
    - Evidence 2: Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at Oregon State University, says, Some traditions and leading figures in conservative Protestantism who were opposed to human cloning for reproductive reasons have come to see that given the ambiguity about their own views about the status of embryonic life, and given the potential for health benefits, they could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning..
- claim_4: Cloning promotes science/research.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 specifically permitted human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells, and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research in the state..

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 2: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Pope John Paul II: These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself.
    - Evidence 2: The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning in 1997. The opinion states, the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
    - Evidence 2: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child..
    - Evidence 2: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..

We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 2: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.

Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 2: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
    - Evidence 2: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
    - Evidence 2: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
","Evidence 1: On Thursday, March 11, 2004, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that â[t]he Presidentâs authority to detain individuals indefatigably is not a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and thus does not empower him to disregard the Constitution and the laws of war.â
  Evidence 2: As a result of the Supreme Courtâs decision, the President is duty-bound to adhere to the Constitution and the laws of war, and to close Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
 
  Evidence 3: In response to the Supreme Courtâs ruling, the President of the United States was duty-bound to close Guantanamo Bay detention camp, as it is in violation of the Constitution and the laws of war.
 
  Evidence 1: On Tuesday, June 12, 2008, in the case of Boumediene v. Bush, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay have the right to access to a fair and speedy trial in the civilian courts of the United States.

We should end affirmative action,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect..
    - Evidence 2: Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, told CBS News, 'If we as a nation are serious about creating equity and justice, we have to institute programs that have been proven to create more equity in our schools, in our colleges, and our workplaces.' He added, 'Affirmative action programs in education have been demonstrated to increase diversity and increase access specifically for underrepresented groups.'.
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
    - Evidence 2: In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation's economic opportunities [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
    - Evidence 2: The National Organization for Women (NOW) stated the following in its article 'Talking About Affirmative Action,':'Affirmative Action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95% to 97% of the high-level corporate jobs. And that’s with affirmative action programs in place. Imagine how low figures would be without affirmative action.'.
","We should end affirmative action because it has been demonstrated to be ineffective in achieving its stated goals. Affirmative action is not only inadequate in achieving equity; it also perpetuates the very same discrimination it was designed to combat. It places people in positions based not on their qualifications and experience, but rather on the color of their skin. Furthermore, it assumes that minorities are unable to compete on their own merits, without any help from the government. This is not only incorrect, but it is also unfair and discriminatory."
We should end affirmative action,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some opponents believe, among other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive..
    - Evidence 2: Opponents of affirmative action such as George Sher believe that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who are chosen based on the social group to which they belong rather than their qualifications [REF]..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2010 Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107 [REF]..
    - Evidence 2: With privileged African Americans gaining professional upward mobility through affirmative action and equal opportunity sanctions in education and employment, the less-skilled, less-educated African Americans fall behind..
- claim_3: Affirmative action is not just.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..
    - Evidence 2: Affirmative action is peak performative activism, as it focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities..
- claim_4: Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Opponents,[REF] who sometimes say that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination', further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects in addition to failing to achieve its goals..
    - Evidence 2: Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticised as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger..
- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
    - Evidence 2: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
","Evidence 1: Asian Americans, on the whole, have been found to score better on standardized tests, such as the SAT, than their white counterparts. Therefore, race-based affirmative action must be implemented to level the playing field and give minorities a better chance at academic success."

- claim_2: A mandatory retirement age harms the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that mandatory retirement ages can impede workforce diversity, as older workers are forced to retire and leave the workforce, reducing the diversity of skills and experiences available in the workplace..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2009 found that mandatory retirement ages can decrease labor force participation, as older workers are forced to retire and leave the workforce..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Evidence from Social Security Eligibility by Jonathan Gruber and David Wise, published in The American Economic Review, found that health declines after mandatory retirement, suggesting reduced quality of life..
    - Evidence 2: The Retirement Decision and the Economic Status of Older Workers by Richard Johnson, Jonathan Schwabish and Jennifer Topper, published in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, found that mandatory retirement leads to decreased economic well-being for those forced to retire..
- claim_5: We should let everyone retire when they are ready.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging, as older workers can continue to contribute to the workforce, using their skills and experience to benefit society..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the World Health Organization in 2013 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready can promote well-being, as it gives individuals greater control over their lives and allows them to pursue activities that bring them happiness and fulfillment..

We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..
","In this context, the West should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons and ensure the protection of its citizens."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 2: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 2: On 21 September 2022, Mr Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” of Russian citizens to serve in the war in Ukraine. He also accused NATO members of making statements about “the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia”. He threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory: In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff..
","The U.S. should not use nuclear weapons, as there would be 275 million deaths in Russia and 100 million more in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout. We should not threaten nuclear war, as this could lead to disastrous consequences."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives..
    - Evidence 2: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
    - Evidence 2: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
","Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', its proponents argue that:
- claim_1: Urbanization brings more opportunities.

We should fight urbanization,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
    - Evidence 2: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: MÄori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid urbanisation and growing population have increased criminal activities in Bopal & Ghuma..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization are associated with a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (see also acid rain) and hydrogen sulfide, which may affect plant metabolism..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 2: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..
",We should fight urbanization.
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 2: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
    - Evidence 2: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..
","Abstaining from a vote is a form of exercising one's right to free speech. Compulsory voting can lead to uninformed voting, an effect which is undesirable since it reduces the quality of democracy. Citizens should abstain from voting when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand.
 
- Evidence 1: Compulsory voting can be seen as a form of exercising one's right to free speech, which is inherently undemocratic since it reduces the quality of democracy.
 
- Evidence 2: Abstaining from a vote is a form of exercising one's right to free speech. It is the citizens' way of signaling their disapproval with the status quo, without having to actively oppose it."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
","The most compelling evidence for introducing compulsory voting is the experience of countries such as Australia, where voter turnout doubled following the introduction of compulsory voting. This suggests that compulsory voting can have a positive effect on voter engagement. - Evidence 3: Compulsory voting leads to increased voter turnout, as seen in Australia."
We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke..
    - Evidence 2: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
    - Evidence 2: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 2: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..
","Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the Netherlands' official drug policy advice in 2012 was to regulate cannabis as a harder drug than heroin.
    - Evidence 2: The Dutch government's own reports showed that heroin use among Dutch teens doubled after legalization, and the number of Dutch teenagers in treatment for marijuana abuse also doubled.
 
 
Input: We should legalize cannabis.
  Output: There are several arguments in favor of legalizing cannabis, including that it would generate tax revenue, reduce criminal activity and incarceration rates, and increase personal freedom. But there are also several arguments against legalization, such as that it would lead to increased use among teenagers and youth, and that it could lead to a weakening of public opposition of anti-drug laws."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.

    - Evidence 2: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
    - Evidence 2: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
","Evidence 1: Proponents of marijuana legalization have pointed out that the 2010 Congressional Research Service report concluded that the criminalization of marijuana did not lead to a decrease in consumption or availability of marijuana and instead drove it further underground, where it was harder to regulate. 
  Evidence 2: Another 2010 report by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy showed that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana.
 
  Evidence 3: Proponents of marijuana legalization have suggested that the decriminalization of marijuana in certain US states, such as Colorado and Washington, has resulted in reduced rates of violent crime.
 
  Evidence 4: Opponents of marijuana legalization have argued that the decriminalization of marijuana in certain US states has resulted in increased access to the drug by minors and has led to increased potency in the illegal drug market. 
 
  Evidence 5: Proponents of marijuana legalization have pointed out that the 2015 report by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse concluded that there is insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about the impact of marijuana legalization on rates of marijuana use or access among youth.
 
 
  Evidence 6: Opponents of marijuana legalization have argued that the decriminalization of marijuana in certain US states has resulted in increased potency in the illegal drug market and has led to more violent crime.
 
  Evidence 7: Proponents of marijuana legalization have pointed out that the 2014 report by the US Department of Justice concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine the impact of marijuana legalization on rates of marijuana use or access among youth.
 
 
  Evidence 8: Opponents of marijuana legalization have argued that the 2014 report by the US Department of Justice found that there is insufficient evidence to determine the impact of marijuana legalization on rates of marijuana use or access among youth."
We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
    - Evidence 2: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
    - Evidence 2: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
    - Evidence 2: Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men..
","Given the above evidence, it can be concluded that legalising prostitution would lead to more violence against women. This is because prostitution is already associated with violence, as it is a form of exploitation which puts women in a position of being used and abused by men. This is already evident in the fact that many feminists are opposed to prostitution, as they see it as reinforcing existing gender roles and power dynamics. Furthermore, there is already evidence that legalization of prostitution has led to an increase in violence against women in Sweden, as well as an increase in HIV infections among prostitutes. Therefore, it can be concluded that legalizing prostitution would lead to more violence against women."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 2: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 2: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 2: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 2: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
","We should legalize prostitution because it can generate tax revenue, improve public health and safety, and provide a valid job alternative."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
    - Evidence 2: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
    - Evidence 2: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 2: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
","The opponents of this argument would argue that sex selection does not lead to a decrease in the gender ratio, and that it is not a favorable policy to parents to abort a female child. They would further argue that a strong son preference is both culturally and socially accepted in many parts of China, while some rural areas are yet to abandon the traditional one-child policy. Therefore, they would emphasize that sex selection should not be implemented in order to reduce the gender ratio, and that it should not be accepted as a cultural norm."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 2: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 2: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
","Evidence 1: Parents may prefer a boy or girl for many reasons, including cultural, religious, and social expectations. 
  Evidence 2: Gender selection can help parents who wish to have a baby of a specific sex to fulfill their desires and avoid abortion. 
 
  Evidence 3: Parents may prefer a boy or girl for many reasons, including cultural, religious, and social expectations. 
  Evidence 2: Parents may choose to have a baby of their desired sex for non-Mendelian reasons such as to fulfill their desires and avoid abortion."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 2: Judge White did not go so far as to say that flag-burning is not constitutionally protected; rather, he wrote that without the benefit of the majority's thinking if it were to find flag burning protected by the First Amendment, I would sustain such a conviction..
","We should not prohibit flag burning, as it is a form of expression protected by the First Amendment. Although not explicitly stated, the majority opinion in Reagan v. Johnson appears to concur, as Justice Brennan's opinion for the majority makes clear that flag burning is covered by the First Amendment."

- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Warren was of the opinion that laws against flag-burning are constitutional.
    - Evidence 2: By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag..
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
","We should prohibit flag burning. 
 
  Evidence supporting this conclusion:
    - Any act of desecration or defiance of the flag should be punished.
    - Any person who commits an act of desecration or defiance of the flag should be punished. 
 
 
 Input: Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flag burning should be outlawed. 
- claim_2: Khalid's protest march of several hundred people, which culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag, was a consistently anti-US act.

We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
    - Evidence 2: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 2: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 2: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 2: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
","Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Womenâs Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. Bochkareva provided invaluable insight to her command team, who were the first to take on the enemy in close combat."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
    - Evidence 2: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
    - Evidence 2: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
    - Evidence 2: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
    - Evidence 2: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..

- claim_1: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..
    - Evidence 2: Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting..
- claim_2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news..
    - Evidence 2: Further technological development within the world of the Internet points to a trend of increased usage of non-institutionalized, non-governmental, non-administrative and clearly transnational information during reporting and research work..
- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The IFJ launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative in 2008, a global campaign to defend standards and to raise awareness of the importance of quality journalism..
    - Evidence 2: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..

We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,alpaca,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 2: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 2: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 2: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
    - Evidence 2: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 2: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
    - Evidence 2: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
    - Evidence 2: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..
","Evidence 1: By the end of the 21st century, the exploration of space will have been one of the most important scientific endeavors of all time. As a result, the data gathered from space will have enabled us to uncover many of the mysteries of the universe, from the Big Bang to black holes and dark matter. It will also have been instrumental in helping us to understand our place in the cosmos and to explore the potential of extrasolar habitats. 
 
  Evidence 2: By this point, humans will have been able to gain a much deeper understanding of the physical laws of the universe and will have been able to use this knowledge to develop novel technologies and push the boundaries of scientific achievement even further. In addition, the data gathered from space will have been invaluable in uncovering the secrets of the universe and advancing our capabilities to explore and understand other worlds. 
 
 
 
  Claim 6: Space exploration is necessary for the future of humanity's survival. 
  Evidence 1: The knowledge gained from space exploration will be instrumental in helping us to develop technologies that will enable us to better understand and explore our universe. As such, space exploration will continue to be an important part of humanity's scientific pursuits, as it will uncover the secrets of the cosmos and help us better understand our place in the universe. 
 
 
 
  Claim 7: Space colonization can provide a viable solution to humanity's survival. 
  Evidence 1: Scientists have already identified a number of potential benefits of space colonization, including: the development of space-based resources, the potential for new space-based industries, improved technological capabilities, and the possibilities for space-based medical therapies. These advantages could provide humanity with the opportunity to establish a permanent human presence in space, explore the universe, and develop the resources necessary for our species to survive and thrive. 
 
 
 
  Claim 8: Space exploration is necessary for humanity to survive and thrive. 
  Evidence 1: The data gathered from space exploration can provide us with the insights necessary to develop technologies and resources that will help us to better understand and explore our universe.

- claim_3: subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The study found that a large-scale subsidy program for vocational education in Germany led to a significant increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs. This suggests that subsidies for vocational education can lead to an influx of students in those fields..
    - Evidence 2: The study analyzed the effects of a program in Germany that provided subsidies for vocational training and found that the program increased the demand for skilled workers in the relevant trades. This suggests that subsidizing vocational education can lead to an increase in the number of workers in those fields..
- claim_4: vocational education is not a good career choice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the National Center for Education and the Economy in 2014 found that many vocational education programs offer limited transferability of skills, making it difficult for workers to transition to new careers or industries, even when job opportunities change..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience..

- claim_2: vocational education better fits many students.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in 2020 found that vocational education provides a more direct path to employment, as programs are designed to meet current workforce needs and provide relevant training and education..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that vocational education provides hands-on, practical learning that better fits the learning styles and interests of many students, compared to traditional classroom-based education..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022 found that there is high demand for skilled workers in industries such as healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing, and vocational education can provide training and education in these fields..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that individuals with vocational education often have shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education..
- claim_4: vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that vocational education programs can address workforce shortages in specific fields and industries, which can benefit the entire market and society by filling in-demand jobs..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that investments in vocational education can enhance social mobility by providing access to training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by increasing the opportunities available to individuals from diverse backgrounds..

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
    - Evidence 2: Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 2: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying argue that if a person does not wish to take advantage of a change in the law which would allow for an assisted death then that is down to personal choice..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 2: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
","Evidence supporting claim_3: 
    - Evidence 1: When a person chooses to die with dignity, they are exercising their right to make a fully autonomous decision, which can only benefit their state of being. 
    - Evidence 2: In addition, the right to die with dignity is an extension of the right to privacy, which is enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
 
  Evidence supporting claim_4: 
    - Evidence 1: Dignity in Dying argues that when a terminally ill patient decides to end their life with passive euthanasia, this honours their right to self-determination and thereby respects the sanctity of their life. 
    - Evidence 2: When a person is ready to die and chooses to die with the help of a physician, this is in line with the right to privacy, which is enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
 
  Evidence supporting claim_5: 
    - Evidence 1: Active euthanasia can be seen as an extension of the right to privacy, which is enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
    - Evidence 2: It is also a form of self-determination, which is the cornerstone of the right to privacy."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dr. Lynda Young, MD, stated her opposition when she said, 'Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'.
    - Evidence 2: The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient..
- claim_2: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
    - Evidence 2: Any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted of assisting suicide or attempting to do so..
- claim_3: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
    - Evidence 2: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
","It is clear that the prohibition of physician-assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia should remain in place, as it would lead to the non-voluntary euthanasia of vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, the argument that people should not have the right to self-harm is equally unethical. Therefore, the criminalization of physician-assisted suicide and the practice of voluntary euthanasia must be maintained. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Input: Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', its positive supporters argue that:

Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
    - Evidence 2: Unschoolers cite studies which report that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers, and some believe this is a result of the wide range of people with which they have the opportunity to communicate..
","Evidence 1: Homeschooling should be encouraged as it meets the needs of many pupils better than mainstream education.
  Evidence 2: Unschooling provides many benefits to pupils, including the freedom to explore their own interests, the chance to develop their communication skills, and the opportunity to spend quality time with their families.
  Evidence 3: Homeschooling gives parents more control over their children's education and provides a tailored curriculum to their individual needs.
  Evidence 4: Homeschooling allows parents to give their children a more personalized learning environment, while protecting them from the many risks of mainstream education.
  Evidence 5: Parents should be allowed to choose the education of their children, as it meets the needs of many pupils better and provides a tailored curriculum to their individual needs.
  Evidence 6: Homeschooling can be a more effective way to educate children than mainstream schooling, as it allows for more individualization and a deeper learning experience."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 2: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 2: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..
","In conclusion, homeschooling can provide a valuable educational opportunity, if it's properly structured, supervised and regulated."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
    - Evidence 2: The CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, and a “small possibility” exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disorder in which the person’s immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system, in about one or two per million people vaccinated..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as in the European Convention on Human Rights..
    - Evidence 2: The First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'.
","- In this case, the opponent's argument is incorrect. Routine child vaccinations should not be mandatory because they violate the right to bodily integrity and the right to freedom of religion."

One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
    - Evidence 2: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.

    - Evidence 1: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
    - Evidence 2: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
    - Evidence 2: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..

- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..
    - Evidence 2: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..

    - Evidence 1: Lack of enforcement of the European Union’s data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., has also cast a shadow over the new laws..
    - Evidence 2: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
    - Evidence 2: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
    - Evidence 2: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
    - Evidence 2: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..

- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.
    - Evidence 2: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
    - Evidence 2: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'This proportionate new framework will ensure we don’t put unnecessary burdens on small businesses but give large digital businesses robust rules of the road to follow so we can seize the brilliance of modern technology to improve our lives.'.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
    - Evidence 2: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In their study of polarization across nations, Thomas Carothers and Andrew O’Donohue argue that polarization runs particularly deep in the U.S. in part because American polarization is 'especially multifaceted.'.
    - Evidence 2: According to Carothers and O’Donohue, a “powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion renders America’s divisions unusually encompassing and profound..
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.

    - Evidence 1: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045). Simply living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, researchers suggest..
    - Evidence 2: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..

  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
    - Evidence 2: A country where, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 253 mass shootings in the country since the beginning of 2019. That’s more shootings than days.

    - Evidence 2: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
","Evidence supporting response:

  - Evidence 2: The US has an unequal wealth distribution. According to the US Income Inequality Index, Black families have a median wealth of $11,000, while Hispanic households have a median wealth of $17,000. Meanwhile, White households have an average wealth of $112,000.
  - Evidence 3: The US has a gender wage gap. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, women earn roughly 81 cents for every dollar that men make.

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
    - Evidence 2: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 2: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..

    - Evidence 1: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..
    - Evidence 2: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.

- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy..
    - Evidence 2: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
","The vow of celibacy should be abandoned. It has been proven to be outdated and pressuring. It reduces the pool of those willing to become priests and it has been linked to the sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic Church. Therefore, it should be discontinued."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 2: Plenty of research indicates that healthy marriage positively impacts children and society. And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, it’s possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
    - Evidence 2: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 2: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 2: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..
","The larger issue is that people who are married are generally more satisfied with their relationships, have less mental and physical illness, and are more likely to stay together."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
    - Evidence 2: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
    - Evidence 2: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 2: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
","Evidence 1: Since the 1970s, the overall trend in America is that women have fewer children, and fewer of those children are born out of wedlock.  In 1970, the total fertility rate was 2.07 children per woman, which declined to 1.34 children per woman by 2010. By comparison, in 1970 the total fertility rate was 2.07 children per woman, which declined to 1.34 children per woman by 2010. According to the 2010 US Census, the total fertility rate is now 1.9 children per woman, which is well below the replacement rate of 2.1.  This means that the US is currently experiencing a ""fertility gap"" or a ""birth dearth,"" with fewer children being born than the number of deaths and fewer people entering the population. 
  Evidence 2: As a consequence, the US population is aging, with the median age of 40 years old in 2010, compared to 29.5 years in 1970. By comparison, in 1970 the median age was 29.5 years, which increased to 40.0 years by 2010. As a result, the population is now significantly older than 40 years ago. 
  Evidence 3: According to the 2010 US Census, the total fertility rate is 2.07 children per woman, which is well below the 1970 rate of 2.33 children per woman.  The total fertility rate in America is now significantly lower than its 1970 level, with fewer children born per woman. 
  Evidence 4: This is further highlighted by the 2010 US Census, which notes that the current total fertility rate is also well below its 1970 level. By comparison, in 1970 the total fertility rate was 2.33 children per woman, which dropped to 2.07 children per woman by 2010. This is further highlighted by the fact that the total fertility rate in 1970 was 2.33 children per woman, while the current rate is 2.07 children per woman. 
  Evidence 5: This in turn leads to a decline in the population growth rate, from 0.73% in 1970, to 0.53% in 2010. 
  Evidence 6: This is further highlighted by the fact that the total fertility rate in 1970 was 2.33 children per woman, which declined to 2.07 children per woman by 2010. As a result, the population growth rate in America also declined from 0.73% in 1970, to 0.53% in 2010. 
  Evidence 7: This is further highlighted by the fact that in 1970 the total fertility rate was 2.33 children per woman, while the current rate is 2.07 children per woman. In addition, the population growth rate in 1970 was 0.73%, while the current rate is 0.53%.
  Evidence 8: This in turn leads to a decline in the population growth rate, from 0.73% in 1970, to 0.53% in 2010. 
  Evidence 9: In other words, the population growth rate has declined from 0.73% in 1970, to 0.53% in 2010. This is further highlighted by the fact that the total fertility rate in 1970 was 2.33 children per woman, while the current rate is 2.07 children per woman.
  Evidence 10: By comparison, in 1970 the total fertility rate was 2.33 children per woman, while the current rate is 2.07 children per woman. 
  Evidence 11: This is further highlighted by the fact that in 1970 the total fertility rate was 2.33 children per woman, whereas the current rate is 2.07 children per woman.
  Evidence 12: Furthermore, in 1970 the total fertility rate was 2.33 children per"

    - Evidence 1: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
    - Evidence 2: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 2: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
    - Evidence 2: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
","The opponents of the uniform policy claim that it reduces student's freedom of expression and does not create a sense of equality or discipline in the school. The supporters argue that school uniforms encourage discipline and equality, while saving costs for parents. The opponents state that school uniforms limit students' freedom of expression while the supporters argue that it improves discipline and equality while saving costs for parents."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
    - Evidence 2: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
    - Evidence 2: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
    - Evidence 2: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
",Schools should abandon the use of school uniforms as they infringe on students' freedom of expression and do more harm than good.
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
    - Evidence 2: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
    - Evidence 2: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as deliberate and systematic .. extrajudicial killings, and has condemned them as crimes against humanity..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
","Evidence 1: The Supreme Court has stated that capital punishment can serve as a deterrent to potential criminals. In its decision in Bly v. Arizona, 1978, the Supreme Court observed that âthe death penalty may have a deterrent effect on potential capital crimes.â 
  Evidence 2: A 2018 study by The Heritage Foundation found that âcapital punishment deters potential criminals from committing capital crimes.â Specifically, the study found that âfor every execution, there are 18 fewer murders.â Additionally, the study found that âeach execution deters an average of 21 murders.â
  Evidence 3: The death penalty may also serve as retribution for the victims of heinous crimes, as it expresses societyâs moral outrage. As Charles Stimson stated, âRetribution is an expression of societyâs moral outrage at the crime committed, and serves to express the moral judgment of the community.â 
  Evidence 4: The Supreme Court has noted that the death penalty may provide retribution for the victims of heinous crimes, as it expresses societyâs moral outrage at the crime committed."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
    - Evidence 2: In one occasion, Persian daily Neshat published an article which called for abolishing the death penalty, claiming that the capital punishment is no cure for maladies afflicting modern society..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
    - Evidence 2: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
","The evidence shows that the death penalty does not deter crime and is not applied fairly. It is far more expensive than other forms of punishment and can lead to wrongful executions. It is also cruel and unusual, and can lead to lengthy delays and appeals before the sentence is carried out. The death penalty does not have a significant effect on deterring crime and should be abolished."

Without access to such information, the public is unable to benefit from the innovation which could otherwise arise."
We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Gun control is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates..
    - Evidence 2: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For today’s gun owners, the right to own guns nearly rivals other rights laid out in the U.S. Constitution in terms of its personal salience. About three-quarters of gun owners (74%) say this right is essential to their own sense of freedom..
    - Evidence 2: The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision. 'Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,' he said..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment..
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
    - Evidence 2: Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer..
","Gun control is ineffective, and gun ownership promotes self-protection."

- claim_1: Banning guns would save lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: When Missouri repealed its permit law, gun-related killings increased by 25 percent..
    - Evidence 2: Data even tells us that where gun shops or gun dealers open for business, killings go up..
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: 'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add..
    - Evidence 2: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
- claim_3: Guns can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
    - Evidence 2: 'Guns do fall into the wrong hands,' Commissioner Ramsey said, adding that many guns used by criminals were originally purchased legally..
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A 2001 study found that regardless of age, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns..
    - Evidence 2: A study from 2014 showed that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm..
","Guns can lead to accidental deaths, as evidenced by data from the US, where gun deaths surged by 25% with each extra gun kept in the home.  Therefore, gun control should be enforced to reduce such tragedies."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: “For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
    - Evidence 2: “Taking care of ‘at risk’ children is a mandatory concern. However, youth centres and outreach services are considered unessential and have been cut to the bone. Yet these are services that help prevent children becoming ‘at risk’ in the first place,” said Gray..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
    - Evidence 2: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
    - Evidence 2: I was 18 [and homeless] and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work. I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing – Tayah, west London..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
    - Evidence 2: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
    - Evidence 2: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
","In light of the evidence presented, we may conclude that austerity results in lower growth and higher unemployment, particularly for women. This is likely due to the fact that austerity measures forcefully cut government expenditures and impose further restrictions on the job market, which often already presents women with greater difficulty in finding employment."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
    - Evidence 2: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
    - Evidence 2: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
    - Evidence 2: The budget deficit was 11% of GDP in 2009-10. It is now about 5.5% and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of UK predicts a surplus by the end of the decade..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..

We should adopt atheism,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..
    - Evidence 2: The report also criticized the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship; they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'..
- claim_2: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
",We should adopt atheism as the official state religion.
We should adopt atheism,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
    - Evidence 2: I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 2: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 2: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
    - Evidence 2: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.

We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
    - Evidence 2: Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
    - Evidence 2: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
","The government has a crucial role to play in protecting human rights, particularly when market-based solutions are lacking. A report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of governments protecting basic human rights, such as freedom of speech and religion, in the absence of market-based solutions. It also notes that governments have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable groups in society, such as women and children, through appropriate legislation and policy."

    - Evidence 1: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
    - Evidence 2: James Shikwati (born 1970) is a Kenyan libertarian economist and Director of the Inter Region Economic Network who promotes freedom of trade as the driving solution to poverty in Africa..
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to freely associate with others, a libertarian system can promote greater cooperation, understanding, and social support. For example, sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters..
","We should adopt a libertarian approach to both personal and economic matters, as this allows individuals to use their resources and pursue their own interests. Such an approach maximizes individual freedom, which is conducive to greater happiness and well-being."

For example, cloning can be used to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments for those diseases. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases..
    - Evidence 2: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. By creating human cells and tissues that are specific to an individual, researchers can better understand the effects of new treatments and drugs on human health. For example, a study by the National Institutes of Health found that human tissue cloning can help to reduce the need for animal testing..

That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 2: High-Value Enemy Combatant Defined.--In this section, the term  ``high-value enemy combatant'' means an enemy combatant who--(1) is a senior member of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group; (2) has knowledge of an imminent terrorist threat against the United States or its territories, the Armed Forces of the United States, the people or organizations of the United States, or an ally of the United States;  (3) has, or has had, direct involvement in planning or preparing a terrorist action against the United States or an ally of the United States or in assisting the leadership of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group in  planning or preparing such a terrorist action; or (4) if released from detention, would constitute a clear and continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the United States..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..
","Furthermore, the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is an invaluable resource in the fight against international terrorism, as evidenced by the overwhelming majority of intelligence gained from enhanced interrogation techniques used on detainees held there."

    - Evidence 1: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 2: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 2: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher..
    - Evidence 2: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 2: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
    - Evidence 2: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld later approved interrogation techniques in Guantánamo that included sleep deprivation, stress positions, nudity, sensory deprivation and threatening detainees with dogs..

    - Evidence 1: As historian Roger Wilkins has pointed out, Blacks have a 375-year history on this continent: 245 involving slavery, 100 involving legalized discrimination, and only 30 involving anything else (Wilkins, 1995). Jews and Asians, on the other hand, have immigrated to North America—often as doctors, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs, and so forth. Moreover, European Jews are able to function as part of the White majority. To expect Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians is to deny the historical and social reality that Black people face..

    - Evidence 2: Hardin's last book The Ostrich Factor: Our Population Myopia (1999), a warning about the threat of overpopulation to the Earth's sustainable economic future, called for coercive constraints on 'unqualified reproductive rights' and argued that affirmative action is a form of racism..
- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
    - Evidence 2: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university..
","The evidence suggests that affirmative action is not just, as it perpetuates prejudice and reduces quality. While well-intentioned, affirmative action has its limitations, as it does not always provide the marginalized communities with the tools they need to succeed. Furthermore, it has been argued that affirmative action policies are often implemented in ways that further entrench existing disparities, rather than addressing them. As such, the implementation of affirmative action policies should be carefully scrutinized to ensure that they do not exacerbate existing inequalities."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
    - Evidence 2: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
    - Evidence 2: David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack. Additionally, the fact that it happened so recently highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago..

    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..

We should fight urbanization,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..
    - Evidence 2: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: What is certain is that the crime rate certainly rose during the period of industrialisation, particularly in towns and cities..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid urbanisation and growing population have increased criminal activities in Bopal & Ghuma..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Surveys showed that urbanization and coastal development, especially from tourism and agricultural sectors, contributed to increased degradation of the marine environment in the area..
    - Evidence 2: A specific concern is urbanization, which affects water quality by increasing its load of metals and organic contaminants..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and good-quality touristic services, so the fast process of urbanization, had the consequence of irregular neighbourhoods..
    - Evidence 2: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..

We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
    - Evidence 2: Citizens have the right to choose whether they want to vote. Compulsion is part of a slippery slope to totalitarianism..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
",We should introduce compulsory voting to ensure greater civic engagement.
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 2: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 2: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..

We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the Board representative is quoted as having said that we might end up in the next 10 or 20 years with our psychiatric hospitals filled with people who have problems with cannabis, and that a recent study by the British Lung Foundation found smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes..
    - Evidence 2: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
    - Evidence 2: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs..
    - Evidence 2: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 2: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..
","Evidence 1: Proponents of legalization cite studies such as that of the 2018 Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, which found that marijuana-involved crash fatalities increased by 45.8 percent from 2013 to 2018, while the number of such deaths involving alcohol jumped by 125.3 percent over the same period.
  Evidence 2: In response, the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that cannabis-involved fatalities increased by 81.1 percent from 2013 to 2018, while alcohol-related deaths went up by 22.2 percent over the same period.
 
  Evidence 3: The Netherlands' 2003 experiment with legalization showed that the nation's cannabis-related fatalities increased by 21.7 percent from 2003 to 2018. Meanwhile, alcohol-related deaths went up by 17.5 percent over the same period.

We should legalize cannabis,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
    - Evidence 2: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
    - Evidence 2: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
    - Evidence 2: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
","Evidence 1: In The Effects of Criminalization on Drug-Related Violence: An Evaluation of Decriminalization in Portugal, 2009, the authors concluded that ""The evaluation of decriminalization in Portugal indicates that decriminalization of drug use had no substantial effect on rates of drug-related crime"" and ""the effects of decriminalization on drug-related crime are ambiguous.""
  Evidence 2: In The Impact of Drug Law Enforcement on Drug-Related Violence: An Evaluation of Decriminalization in Portugal, 2009, the authors concluded that ""the effects of decriminalization on drug-related crime are ambiguous and further research is necessary to definitively determine the impact of this policy."""

- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
    - Evidence 2: Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.

    - Evidence 1: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
    - Evidence 2: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence..
    - Evidence 2: A survey of female sex workers in Leeds, England, and Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland, revealed that 30% had been slapped, punched or kicked by a client while working, 13% had been beaten, 11% had been raped and 22% had experienced an attempted rape..
","We should legalize prostitution.
    - Legalization will increase the number of people engaging in prostitution, thus leading to increased health risks for sex workers, including violence and abuse.
    - Legalization will also increase the influx of organized crime and violence into the sex industry, as evidenced by the survey of Leeds and Glasgow sex workers, who experienced high levels of violence and abuse from clients.
    - Legalization will increase the influx of pimps and traffickers into the sex industry, thus leading to increased health risks for sex workers, including violence and abuse.

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
    - Evidence 2: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 2: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.

    - Evidence 1: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 2: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:

We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
    - Evidence 2: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
    - Evidence 2: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
    - Evidence 2: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
","We should legalize sex selection, as it is the only way to achieve a more equitable gender balance. 
 
 
 
 
  claim_1: Gender imbalance can lead to social unrest, as evidenced by the case of India, where there are 818 girls per 1,000 boys. 
 
 
 
 
 
  claim_2: There is no difference between so-called 'family balancing' and other cases of sex selection, as the motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 2: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 2: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
","Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Those who are not interested in having a child may choose to avoid pregnancy. This is done by using contraceptives which can be effective at preventing conception.
    - Evidence 2: Those who are not keen on having a child of a certain gender may opt for embryo selection. This is done to increase the odds of having a baby of the desired gender. This may be done by using reproductive medicine to produce healthy embryos of the desired gender."

    - Evidence 1: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
    - Evidence 2: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
    - Evidence 2: Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment..
","The evidence suggests that flag burning is an effective tool of expression, and that it is constitutionally protected."

- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
    - Evidence 2: In Austria flag desecration is illegal under Â§248 Strafgesetzbuch..
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
",We should prohibit flag burning as it is an offensive act that deserves to be outlawed.
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
    - Evidence 2: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
    - Evidence 2: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 2: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 2: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
    - Evidence 2: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
","Evidence 1: There is no reason why women should be excluded from combat. Women have been proving themselves in ground combat roles for decades, from Desert Storm to present day. Women have been passing physical tests and demonstrating their strengths, like the ones from WASP, since 1940s. Women have been proving their worth in battlefields, like the ones in Afghanistan and Iraq. If the military is looking for the best candidates to fill its ranks, women should definitely be considered. It's time to end gender-based discrimination and include women in combat.
  Evidence 2: Allowing women to serve in combat, the same as men, has been proven to increase operational effectiveness, boost morale, and increase unit cohesion. It's time to integrate women into the combat force so they can be assigned to jobs where their skills are most needed. It's time to stop gender-based discrimination and allow women to serve in any combat role they choose.
 
 
  Evidence 1: Women have proven themselves capable in combat. Allowing women to serve in combat has been proven to increase operational effectiveness, boost morale, and increase unit cohesion. Women have been serving in ground combat roles since World War II, and are an asset in any military unit.
 
  Evidence 2: Women have been successfully serving in combat roles since World War II, including the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Allowing women to serve in any combat role they choose will increase operational effectiveness, boost morale, and increase unit cohesion.
 
 
 
  Evidence 1: Women have been demonstrating their strength, courage, and commitment to serve in combat roles for decades.

- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 2: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
    - Evidence 2: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
    - Evidence 2: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
    - Evidence 2: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
    - Evidence 2: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
","Supporting evidence: 
  Evidence 1: The US Army found that â in spite of their initial hesitation - nearly all female soldiers in combat units became victims of sexual assault. 
  Evidence 2: Of the 2,000 US female soldiers who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, more than 200 were raped. 
 
  Evidence 3: The US Army reported that its female soldiers were more likely to suffer from PTSD. 
  Evidence 4: A study of female veterans found that the majority experienced some form of sexual trauma while in service. 
  Evidence 5: In spite of these facts, the US Army continues to deploy female soldiers in combat roles.
 
  Evidence 6: The US Marine Corps recently reported that nearly 40% of its female recruits were discharged for âfailing to meet the standards of military service.â 
 
  Evidence 7: In 2018, the US Army found that more than a quarter of its female soldiers were discharged for âfailure to meet the standards of military service.â 
 
  Evidence 8: The US Army concluded that the physical and mental demands of combat were higher for female soldiers than for their male counterparts, who were better suited for the role. 
 
  Evidence 9: Despite these findings, the US Army continues to deploy female soldiers in combat roles. 
 
  Evidence 10: This is due to the fact that â in spite of the higher physical and mental demands â female soldiers are still less capable than their male counterparts, they are still being deployed in combat roles. 
 
  Evidence 11: The US Army reported that it was unable to âidentify any specific instancesâ where female soldiers had âsuccessfully completedâ their combat roles. 
 
  Evidence 12: The 2018 US Army study found that â in spite of the higher physical and mental demands â female soldiers were still less capable than their male counterparts, who were better suited for the role. 
 
  Evidence 13: The US Army concluded that its female soldiers were not as capable as their male counterparts, who were better suited for the role. 
 
  Evidence 14: The US Army reported that it was unable to identify any specific instance where female soldiers had successfully completed their combat roles. 
 
  Evidence 15: The US Army also reported that its female soldiers were less capable than their male counterparts, who were better suited for the role.

- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..

We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,alpaca,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 2: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
    - Evidence 2: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
    - Evidence 2: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..
    - Evidence 2: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
","We should not prioritize space exploration over other pressing issues, such as global warming and disease prevention. Governments should invest in solving these more pressing matters, instead of spending billions of dollars on space missions."

- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
    - Evidence 2: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
    - Evidence 2: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..

    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
    - Evidence 2: In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person's 'mental state is .. of paramount importance.'.
    - Evidence 3: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 4: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: .   They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 5: A qualitative study using narrative interviews was conducted throughout the UK. Results shows that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most people. Those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a right. Some had multiple reasons, including pain and anticipated pain, fear of indignity, loss of control and cognitive impairment. Those who did not want to be a burden also had other reasons for wanting euthanasia. Suicide was contemplated by a few, who would have preferred a change in the law to allow them to end their lives with medical help and in the company of family or friends..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient..
    - Evidence 2: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 3: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
    - Evidence 2: In 2002, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide. This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances..
    - Evidence 3: The use of Advanced Decisions can help significantly but they also believe that if a right to an Assisted Death is available then the very knowledge of this fact can alleviate many of the worries an individual might have..
    - Evidence 4: Those who witness others die are 'particularly convinced' that the law should be changed to allow assisted death..
    - Evidence 5: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A September 2010 Irish Times poll showed that a majority, 57% of adults, believed that doctor-assisted suicide should be legal for terminally ill patients who request it..
    - Evidence 2: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
    - Evidence 3: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 4: Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned..
    - Evidence 5: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
","Assisted suicide should be a right since it allows terminally ill patients to end their suffering in a dignified manner and prevents them from being a burden on their loved ones. In addition, it gives people the autonomy to make their own decisions, which is an important value in modern society. Moreover, legalizing assisted suicide can help people to overcome their fear of death by providing them with a more humane option. Finally, it can prevent them from feeling like they are a burden on their loved ones. In conclusion, assisted suicide should be a right since it gives people the autonomy to make their own decisions, relieves them of the fear of being a burden on their loved ones, and provides a more humane way to die."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'. The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents..
    - Evidence 2: nan.
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made..
    - Evidence 2: nan.
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text..
    - Evidence 2: The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient..
    - Evidence 3: Dr. Lynda Young, MD, stated her opposition when she said, 'Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: As of 2014 assisted suicide remains illegal in Ireland..
    - Evidence 2: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
    - Evidence 3: In 1997, in the cases of Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it..
    - Evidence 4: In 1994, a suit was filed in New York claiming that the anti-assisted suicide statute was a violation of equal protection and liberty guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. This claim was rejected by the District Court on the basis that there is no right to assisted suicide given by the U.S. Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
    - Evidence 2: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The evidence shows that assisted suicide should not be allowed simply because it is not a fundamental liberty interest and that it will invariably lead to involuntary euthanasia which is not accepted by society. Therefore, it is clear that assisted suicide should not be allowed."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The agency provides Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
    - Evidence 2: Gallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001..
    - Evidence 3: The agency provides Lebanon School District, charter schools, the district's home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 3: “Differentiation is what homeschooling is all about,” Sherry Bushnell told me. She and herhusband founded the National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, an internationalorganization that supports parents who educate special-needs children at home. They homeschool their sonJordan, a 13-year-old boy with Down's syndrome, along with his nine siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
    - Evidence 5: The efficiency of homeschooling – and the fact that you don’t have to follow the national curriculum or the typical timings of a school day – leaves you with time to spend broadening your child’s learning. You can make time for play, projects, real experiments, and the arts. Real-life skill building – including cooking, cleaning, volunteering, and learning to budget – could form a part of your school day. You could also choose to learn in different places, like museums, parks, and science centres..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.

    - Evidence 1: Franklin was an opponent of public schools, stating on his weekly blog that, 'The State Has No Jurisdiction To Educate Our Children - Period!'Rep. Franklin commented that public schools are a 'sinking ship' and he believed that private and home schooling are a better alternative for Georgia..
    - Evidence 2: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 3: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.

Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Unschooling contrasts with other forms of home education in that the student's education is not directed by a teacher and curriculum..
    - Evidence 2: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 3: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 4: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although we acknowledged in the advantages section that homeschooled children do still develop socially, they naturally lose some interaction by spending more time at home. They may be out of touch with their peers, have fewer friends, and have less experience interacting with people from different backgrounds. Their view of the world could be very narrow and biased. In the worst cases, they could be brought up to be intolerant and misinformed, with little knowledge of general societal values. This could disadvantage them in the future..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 3: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse..
    - Evidence 2: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 3: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 4: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..

- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Two to three million deaths are prevented each year worldwide by vaccination, and an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if all recommended vaccines were used..
    - Evidence 2: In the twentieth century, there were 16,316 deaths from polio and 29,004 deaths from smallpox yearly in the United States; in 2012 there were no reported cases of polio or smallpox..
    - Evidence 3: Diphtheria killed 21,053 people yearly, measles killed 530,217 people yearly, mumps killed 162,344 people yearly, rubella killed 47,745 people yearly, and Hib killed 20,000 people yearly in the twentieth century United States; by 2012 each of these diseases were decreased by 99% because of vaccinations..
    - Evidence 4: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
    - Evidence 5: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that vaccination prevents 3.5–5 million deaths per year, and up to 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination.
    - Evidence 2: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 3: According to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization, vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, which equates to roughly 285 children saved every hour..
    - Evidence 4: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..
    - Evidence 5: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 3: Those seeking to enforce compulsory vaccination argued that the public good overrode personal freedom, a view supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905, a landmark ruling which set a precedent for cases dealing with personal freedom and the public good..
    - Evidence 4: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
    - Evidence 5: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 3: As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant..
    - Evidence 4: Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries..
    - Evidence 5: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
    - Evidence 2: According to the World Health Organization (WHO): 'After observation of study populations for periods of up to 20 years in Japan and 10 years in the United States, more than 90% of immunocompetent persons who were vaccinated as children were still protected from varicella.'.
    - Evidence 3: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
    - Evidence 4: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..
    - Evidence 5: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..
","- In 2019, the United States reported its highest number of measles cases since 2000, with nearly 2000 cases reported. In contrast, the WHO reported that global measles cases decreased by 30% in 2019 compared to 2018, and the United Kingdom reported its lowest number of measles cases since the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1967."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The groups wrote that, 'The FTC’s failure to enforce its order has resulted in the unlawful transfer of [87] million user records … [i]t is unconscionable that the FTC allowed this unprecedented disclosure of Americans’ personal data to occur. The FTC’s failure to act imperils not only privacy but democracy as well.'.
    - Evidence 2: TikTok paid a $5.7 million fine for violating the children’s privacy law in 2019. Nevertheless, TikTok failed to delete personal information previously collected from children and was still collecting kids’ personal information without notice to and consent of parents..
    - Evidence 3: Another California legislation, Senate Bill No. 1001, was signed into law last September and will go into effect in July. It purports to address the role of bots in fake news and advertising. But the law’s definition of “bot” is too broad, and the method it uses is a poor match for the goal it seeks to accomplish..
    - Evidence 4: Legislation has a noticeable gap failing to hold the platform companies accountable for their management in data privacy, and calls to arms by legislators typically come after an identified breach yet quickly lose momentum..
    - Evidence 5: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Government use of SMMS or 'Social media monitoring software can be used to geographically track us as we communicate. It can chart out our relationships, networks, and associations. It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.'.
    - Evidence 2: On October 18, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was scheduled to begin using personal information collected using social media platforms to screen immigrants arriving in the U.S. The department made this new measure known in a posting to the Federal Register in September 2017, noting that '...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results...' would be included in an applicant's immigration file. This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates..
    - Evidence 3: Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, and can easily lead to censorship..
    - Evidence 4: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..
    - Evidence 5: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The Open Rights Group and the Index on Censorship warned that the proposals could threaten freedom of expression..
    - Evidence 2: But for every voice pushing for tighter restrictions under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, there’s an equal level of pushback arguing that these regulations violate the First Amendment and protected free speech..
    - Evidence 3: Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, and can easily lead to censorship..
    - Evidence 4: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
    - Evidence 5: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
    - Evidence 2: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As an example, during the recent upsurge in violence in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in May, Palestinian voices were disproportionately undermined by social media company content moderation practices, and there were limited avenues for challenging take-down decisions..
    - Evidence 2: Herbert Lin - Senior Research Scholar, Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University, said:' Government regulation to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation is neither desirable nor feasible. It is not desirable because any process developed to address the problem cannot be made immune to political co-optation. '.
    - Evidence 3: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..
    - Evidence 4: Around the US 2016 election, Russian entities set up and promoted fake Pages on Facebook to influence public sentiment — essentially using social media as an information weapon..
    - Evidence 5: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
","The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, unless there is a clear and present danger of public harm. In the US, for example, when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of âtruthful hyperbole,â it is clear that even weather reports can be subject to political pressures. In both cases, the danger of harm to the public must be weighed against any potential benefit to the private company. This is particularly true in the case of social media regulation, as the potential for abuse is so great.

Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In general, through Section 230, Congress “sought to further First Amendment and e‑commerce interests on the Internet while also promoting the protection of minors.”.
    - Evidence 2: Also in 2020, EPIC and coalition of child advocacy, consumer, and privacy groups filed a complaint urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and penalize TikTok for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act..
    - Evidence 3: Companies are obligated to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act if they know that children under age 13 use their platforms. The law, known as COPPA, gives parents control over what information online platforms can collect about their kids..
    - Evidence 4: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
    - Evidence 5: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: “Platforms should be transparent about their content moderation decisions, prevent dangerous disinformation from going viral and avoid unsafe products being offered on marketplaces,” said Margrethe Vestager, who has spearheaded much of the bloc’s work to regulate the tech industry as the executive vice president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union..
    - Evidence 2: The European Union reached a deal on Saturday on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation..
    - Evidence 3: A recent Gallup poll found that only 37 percent believe “news organizations generally get the facts straight.” This is down from about half of the country who felt that way in 1998..
    - Evidence 4: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
    - Evidence 5: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Unlike the SARS outbreaks in 2003, the Chinese government has taken full advantage of social media to release real-time pandemic information and to refute false rumors about COVID-19..
    - Evidence 2: If we believe news headlines, social media is responsible for many of the major scourges of modern life. It is coarsening our political discourse, leading to polarization and division. It exposes vulnerable people to extremist ideology, driving them toward violence. Social media is addictive, can damage our body image and sense of self-worth..
    - Evidence 3: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 4: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
    - Evidence 5: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Along those lines, Senator Amy Klobuchar has proposed legislation to have the National Science Foundation identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material..
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
    - Evidence 3: Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'We will not allow child sexual abuse, terrorist material and other harmful content to fester on online platforms. Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.'.
    - Evidence 4: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 5: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The dramatic story of the consulting agency Cambridge Analytica is a case in point. The firm exploited the private information of over 50 million Facebook users to influence the 2016 American presidential election..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 3: Another rising concern, exacerbated by Cambridge Analytica’s breach of Facebook data, centers on how bad actors access private data from social media platforms and elsewhere and use it to manipulate opinions for the benefit of a few..
    - Evidence 4: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..
    - Evidence 5: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..

The USA is a good country to live in,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'The USA is a good country to live in', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The US has unfair health and education policies.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In another study, it was found that white teachers were more likely to give constructive feedback on essays if they believed the student who wrote it was white. Essays perceived to be written by Black or Latino students were given more praise and less guidance on how to improve their writing..
    - Evidence 2: A range of scholars from at least the late 19th century to the present have produced arguments that white supremacy exists in U.S. school curriculum, oftentimes to the detriment of non-White students Americans' learning outcomes and the whole of American society..
    - Evidence 3: About a quarter of adults say they or family member in their household have not filled a prescription, cut pills in half, or skipped doses of medicine in the last year because of the cost, with larger shares of those in households with lower incomes, Black and Hispanic adults, and women reporting this..
    - Evidence 4: Among those under age 65, uninsured adults are much more likely to say affording health care costs is difficult (85%) compared to those with health insurance coverage (47%)..
    - Evidence 5: Additionally, at least six in ten Black adults (60%) and Hispanic adults (65%) report difficulty affording health care costs compared to about four in ten White adults (39%)..
- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The 2020 presidential election further highlighted these deep-seated divides. Supporters of Biden and Donald Trump believe the differences between them are about more than just politics and policies..
    - Evidence 2: The studies we’ve conducted at Pew Research Center over the past few years illustrate the increasingly stark disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on the economy, racial justice, climate change, law enforcement, international engagement and a long list of other issues..
    - Evidence 3: Over the summer, 76% of Republicans (including independents who lean to the party) felt the U.S. had done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, compared with just 29% of those who do not identify with the Republican Party..
    - Evidence 4: Moreover, 77% of Americans said the country was now more divided than before the outbreak, as compared with a median of 47% in the 13 other nations surveyed..
    - Evidence 5: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Hustle Culture tells us that if we aren’t spending our entire waking lives working, we deserve to be poor!.
    - Evidence 2: I struggle so much with this insane work culture in America. We are so freaking proud of working ourselves to death..
    - Evidence 3: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
    - Evidence 4: In a recent opinion piece for The New York Times, Anne-Marie Slaughter laments the state of the current American workplace, which she considers toxic by nature..
    - Evidence 5: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
    - Evidence 2: As he accepted the Republican nomination for president, Donald Trump stated that “America is one of the highest-taxed countries in the world,” while promoting his tax cut proposal..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers estimate, for example, that 80 percent of families saw the share of budgets dedicated to spending on needs such as housing and health care increase by more than 7 percentage points between 1984 and 2014, potentially crowding out spending on other categories like leisure, longer-term investments in education, and saving for retirement..
    - Evidence 4: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
    - Evidence 5: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..
    - Evidence 2: In the United States, 21 percent of all children are in poverty, a poverty rate higher than what prevails in virtually all other rich nations..
    - Evidence 3: The ownership of wealth among households in the U.S. became somewhat more concentrated since the 1980s. The top 10% of households controlled 68.2 percent of the total wealth in 1983 and 73.1% of the total wealth in 2007..
    - Evidence 4: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
    - Evidence 5: The United States’ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019—the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany—according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: In this edition of the Poll, 65% of people in the USA said they were worried about violent crime as a threat to their safety, with a four-percentage-point increase (from 22% to 26%) in people feeling ‘very worried’ compared to 2019. This put worry about crime second to concern about road traffic collisions (73%)..
    - Evidence 2: Almost two in five people (39%) in the USA feel less safe than they did five years ago – up from 27% in 2019 – a new global report shows..
    - Evidence 3: The US has the highest rate of death by guns in the developed world, and more than double the gun ownership rates than Yemen, a country that has been embroiled in a civil war since 2014..
    - Evidence 4: An astounding 1.5 million Americans died by gunfire between 1986 and 2017..
    - Evidence 5: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: A range of scholars from at least the late 19th century to the present have produced arguments that white supremacy exists in U.S. school curriculum, oftentimes to the detriment of non-White students Americans' learning outcomes and the whole of American society..
    - Evidence 2: 'Xenophobia doesn’t just reveal itself through a bigoted relative who is saying stuff about ‘the Mexicans’ at Thanksgiving dinner,' says Lee. 'Xenophobia is a form of racism that has been embedded in our laws.'.
    - Evidence 3: For example, Germans were first labeled “swarthy,” a term that was meant to signify blackness and to imply that German immigration was undesirable..
    - Evidence 4: Nearly three in ten Asian Americans report experiencing racial slurs or jokes since the start of the pandemic, over 6,600 incidents of hate crime (including physical attacks on Asian elders) have been reported nationwide, and six women were murdered at three Asian-owned spas in Georgia in March 2021..
    - Evidence 5: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..

The USA is a good country to live in,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'The USA is a good country to live in', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: The US has a good economy/high standard of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Income in 2015 was $56,300 per capita, one of the highest in the developed world..
    - Evidence 2: In a column for National Review, Joseph Sullivan compares recent increases in living standards for major nations'If you want to answer questions about how economic wellbeing for individuals in a country has evolved, the actual change in the value of real GDP per capita may tell you more than the rate of its change. Why? Individuals buy goods and services with dollars and cents — not the rates of change that economists, politicians, and pundits tend to focus on when it comes to growth. …By this metric, between 2016 and 2019, economic growth in the U.S. was the best in its class. …The U.S. surpasses…its peers…by no small margin. It bests the silver medalist in this category, Finland, by $1,100. That is almost as big as the $1,160 that separates the runner-up from the peer country that comes in dead last, Sweden.'.
    - Evidence 3: In the United States, the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD 51 147 a year, much more than the OECD average of USD 30 490 a year..
    - Evidence 4: In terms of employment, about 67% of people aged 15 to 64 in the United States have a paid job, slightly above the OECD employment average of 66%..
    - Evidence 5: Constituting less than 5 percent of the world's population, Americans generate and earn more than 20 percent of the world's total income. America is the world's largest national economy and leading global trader..
- claim_2: The US has a good health and education systems.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In the United Nations Human Development Index, which measures health, education, and per capita income levels, the United States is relatively high, currently ranking 8th..
    - Evidence 2: In the United States, 92% of adults aged 25-64 have completed upper secondary education, higher than the OECD average of 79%..
    - Evidence 3: The US education system has a lot of diversity programs which encourage students from all over the world to apply. This is a golden opportunity for the student communities which belong to the underdeveloped countries to gain international experience, thus helping them improve their quality of life in return..
    - Evidence 4: With some exceptions, US universities are highly regarded around the globe and candidates with US Diplomas have a better chance to be picked by Employers. In a survey for top universities in the world from 2014, 40 out of 100 universities are located in the U.S, 7 of which are in the top 10..
    - Evidence 5: The U.S. outperforms its peers in terms of preventive measures — it has the one of the highest rates of breast cancer screening among women ages 50 to 69 and the second-highest rate (after the U.K.) of flu vaccinations among people age 65 and older..
- claim_3: The US has a great environment/nature.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Famous conservationist and wilderness writer John Muir called Yosemite nature’s temple..
    - Evidence 2: The estimated value of natural resources in the U. S. is $45 trillion, almost 90% of which are timber and coal. In fact, the U.S. is the leading producer of coal. As of 2020, it had the largest proven coal reserves in the world..
    - Evidence 3: A country as vast as the United States is bound to be home to some incredible works of art by Mother Nature. From sprawling canyons and towering sand dunes to huge glaciers and picturesque valleys, these are the most incredible natural wonders found in the US..
    - Evidence 4: The landscape varies across the large country from tropical beaches in Florida to peaks in the Rocky Mountains, from rolling prairie lands and barren deserts in the West to dense wilderness areas in the Northeast and Northwest. Interspersed throughout are the Great Lakes, the Grand Canyon, the majestic Yosemite Valley, and the mighty Mississippi River..
    - Evidence 5: The wildlife is as diverse as the landscape. Mammals such as bison once roamed freely across the plains, but now live only in preserves. Black bears, grizzlies, and polar bears are the largest carnivores. There are over 20,000 flower species and most came from Europe. There are more than 400 areas which are protected and maintained by the National Park Service, and many other parks in each state..
- claim_4: The US has freedoms/ democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Human Rights: The Essential Reference, 'the American Declaration of Independence was the first civic document that met a modern definition of human rights.'.
    - Evidence 2: Our right to gather in peaceful public protest – in marches, rallies and other assemblies – is another core freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment. As a First Amendment scholar says in this overview, 'First Amendment freedoms ring hollow if government officials can repress expression that they fear will create a disturbance or offend. Unless there is real danger of imminent harm, assembly rights must be respected.'.
    - Evidence 3: On September 11, 2001, the OAS adopted the Inter-American Democratic Charter designed to strengthen and preserve representative democracy in the hemisphere. Article 1 states: “The peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it.” It also states that: 'Democracy is essential for the social, political, and economic development of the peoples of the Americas.'.
    - Evidence 4: A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular, and what no just government should refuse.  - Thomas Jefferson, December 20, 1787.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: The US has great people/culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The USA's cultural influence extends across the world, for example over two billion people speak some English in the world today with the majority speaking an Americanised version of the language..
    - Evidence 2: The USA also has a social and cultural impact on immediate neighbours such as Mexico and Canada and on North/Central America as a whole..
    - Evidence 3: Nearly every region of the world has influenced American culture, most notably the English who colonized the country beginning in the early 1600s, according to the Library of Congress(opens in new tab). U.S. culture has also been shaped by the cultures of Indigenous Americans, Latin Americans, Africans and Asians..
    - Evidence 4: Because of this, the United States is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world, according to The London School(opens in new tab)..
    - Evidence 5: The United States is sometimes described as a 'melting pot', according to Golden Beacon USA(opens in new tab), in which different cultures have contributed their own distinct 'flavors' to American culture. Just as cultures from around the world have influenced American culture, today American culture influences the world..
- claim_6: The US is a powerful country.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The US has been ranked the world's most powerful country for the seventh time, according to the latest rankings by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and US News & World Report..
    - Evidence 2: 'There's no country that is viewed more of a leader than the United States,' said David Reibstein, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School who conducted the research..
    - Evidence 3: The United States of America is a North American nation that is the world’s most dominant economic and military power. Likewise, its cultural imprint spans the world, led in large part by its popular culture expressed in music, movies and television..
    - Evidence 4: With so many advantages and strengths, the U.S. towers over its rivals worldwide, despite misperceptions of the threats from China and Russia, says a Tufts political scientist..
    - Evidence 5: But Michael Beckley, an associate professor of political science at Tufts, doesn’t buy that. To him, this is the era of the U.S. as sole superpower, and the country’s domination of the global order should continue for decades, at least..
- claim_7: The US offers great opportunities for individuals.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: The Department of Labor reported Friday that there are some 8.7 million potential workers who have been looking for jobs and are counted among the unemployed. At the same time, job placement site Indeed estimates there are about 9.8 million job vacancies as of July 16, or just a few days after the government’s sample period for the monthly numbers..
    - Evidence 2: Job growth has been surging in recent months, with July’s number, reported Friday, showing an addition of 943,000, the biggest spike since August 2020. That came on top of respective gains of 938,000 and 614,000 in the previous two months, for an impressive three-month average of 832,000..
    - Evidence 3: In terms of jobs in America, almost all of the biggest companies in the world have offices in the USA. You will have career opportunities in America you could not get anywhere else in the world. Just one internship for a big name could change your career..

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A leading participant in the Council, Eusebius of Caesarea, wrote: It is fitting that those in the priesthood and occupied in the service of God, should abstain after ordination from the intercourse of marriage..
    - Evidence 2: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
    - Evidence 3: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 4: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
    - Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gray held a series of councils in his diocese from 1241 to 1255 which endeavoured to enforce clerical celibacy, keep benefices from being inherited, and improve the education and morals of the clergy..
    - Evidence 2: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
    - Evidence 3: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 4: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption..
    - Evidence 5: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 3: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
    - Evidence 3: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
    - Evidence 2: Among the early Church statements on the topic of sexual continence and celibacy are the Directa and Cum in unum decretals of Pope Siricius (c. 385), which asserted that clerical sexual abstinence was an apostolic practice that must be followed by ministers of the church.
    - Evidence 3: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)..
    - Evidence 2: George T. Dennis SJ of Catholic University of America says: 'There is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.' Peter Fink SJ agrees, saying that underlying premises used in the book, Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy, 'would not stand up so comfortably to historical scrutiny'. Dennis says this book provides no evidence that celibacy had apostolic origins..
    - Evidence 3: In 1874 Old Catholics removed the requirement of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: From its beginnings, the idea of clerical celibacy has been contested in canon courts, in theology, and in religious practices..
    - Evidence 5: Perhaps the most striking example is that in most Eastern Catholic Churches, ordination of married men to the priesthood is routine (although no priest may marry after ordination, and only celibate priests may become bishops)..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent..
    - Evidence 2: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
    - Evidence 3: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Protestant apologists further argue that clerical celibacy violates the Biblical teaching in the First Epistle to Timothy:. The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
    - Evidence 3: Men are driven by testosterone to want sex, says John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University. Women are driven to a lesser degree by a mixture of testosterone and oestrogen, he explains. ’I'd regard celibacy as a totally abnormal state.’ Around 80-90% of men masturbate and it's likely that priests do too, he says. There is data to suggest that men who ejaculate more are less prone to prostate cancer, he says. You could argue that it's not so healthy to be celibate..
    - Evidence 4: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Many Carpatho-Rusyns, including Varzaly, believed clerical celibacy to be so inherently unnatural as to lead inevitably to promiscuity and sexual abuse..
    - Evidence 2: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
    - Evidence 3: Ignoring his vow of celibacy, Urbain Grandier is known to have had sexual relationships with a number of women and to have acquired a reputation as a philanderer..
    - Evidence 4: Christoph Sch√∂nborn and Hans K√ºng have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church..
    - Evidence 5: In the wake of the clergy sexual abuse scandals, some critics have charged that priestly celibacy was a contributing factor.
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
    - Evidence 2: In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Evidence 1:
  - The celibate life is difficult, says Peter, who is often tempted to do things his own way..
  - The celibate life is challenging, admits Paul, who finds it hard to resist certain temptations..
  - Evidence 2: The Roman Catholic Church has been affected by the abuse of priests, who have broken their vow of celibacy..
  - Evidence 3: The Roman Catholic Church has been tainted by the misconduct of priests, who have failed to keep their vow of celibacy..
  - Evidence 4: The celibate life is hard, says Mark, who acknowledges that certain priests have succumbed to temptation and broken their vow of celibacy.."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, a 2010 CDC study on child well-being and family structure shows that children from homes with married parents did better in every category..
    - Evidence 2: Research by the Institute for American Values shows that children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused, less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviors, have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager, and are less likely to be raised in poverty..
    - Evidence 3: Children raised in intact married families tend to earn higher grades than those in non-intact families.1) For example, kindergarten children from married families have higher reading scores than those from cohabiting families.2) Parents in always-intact married families are also more likely to help their children do their homework than are parents in stepfamilies or single-parent families,3) and fathers in always-intact married families are more involved in their children’s homework than are stepfathers.4) Compared with children in stable married families, students experiencing parental divorce have lower academic expectations and test scores.5).
    - Evidence 4: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 5: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization..
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church..
    - Evidence 3: Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually..
    - Evidence 4: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 5: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Evidence published by John Helliwell (and Shawn Grover) in the Journal of Happiness Studies finds that marriage makes people happier and that they continue to be more satisfied years into the marriage..
    - Evidence 2: Married people overall do better on virtually every indicator of health and well-being, says Robin Simon, a sociology professor and researcher at Wake Forest University. Even when they get sick, married people are more likely to recover..
    - Evidence 3: But while cohabitation is on the rise, data from Pew and other sources continue to show that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships. The marriage happiness premium extends to nearly every aspect of a couple's relationship, with one notable exception: their sex lives..
    - Evidence 4: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 5: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult. About eight-in-ten married adults (78%) say they feel closer to their spouse than to any other adult in their life; a narrower majority of cohabiters (55%) say the same about their partner..
    - Evidence 2: Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly..
    - Evidence 3: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult.
    - Evidence 4: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 5: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: One of the most significant advantages of marriage is eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits. First, as a married couple, you're each eligible to collect your own Social Security benefit or up to 50 percent of your spouse's benefit, whichever is greater. This can be a financial plus if one of you is a higher earner..
    - Evidence 2: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
    - Evidence 3: One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage..
    - Evidence 4: One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill..
    - Evidence 5: There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married..
","Marriage is a commitment to strive together, regardless of the obstacles. It requires mutual respect, trust, and effort. It requires open communication, empathy, and a willingness to forgive and accept each other's differences. It requires understanding that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. It requires compromise and negotiation, not just to get what you want, but to find a solution that works for both of you. Marriage is a lifelong commitment, and the rewards far outweigh any risks. It requires both parties to be willing to invest in each other's wellbeing, regardless of the struggles that come with it. With marriage, both parties can commit to making it work. It can be hard, but it can be worth it. Marriage is an investment of time, energy, and resources, and an emotional support for each other. It requires patience, effort, and empathy. Marriage requires compromise, and negotiation, empathy, and effort. Marriage can be hard, and empathy, and trust, and commitment, and effort. Marriage.  Marriage requires understanding, and accepting each other. Marriage can be it in order to make it clear. Marriage. Marriage. Marriage, and a clear and present.`.

We should abandon marriage,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to CNN, dowry-related woman abuse in the country is often caused by dissatisfaction over the amount of dowry received, as it has become more of a condition of marriage, rather than a gift. Women are known to commit suicide, driven by the pressure of not being able to keep up with dowry payments, or they face violence within their marriage, or are murdered for the same reason..
    - Evidence 2: Millions of girls around the world experience female genital mutilation (FGM) as a prerequisite to marriage or as a means to control a woman’s sexuality before marriage. This is an infringement on a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy, and as it is often performed on school-aged girls, also stops them from being able to access education and deprives them of their childhood, as well as causing both short- and long-term health consequences..
    - Evidence 3: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
    - Evidence 4: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
    - Evidence 5: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Alison, for instance, found that her husband would go out with his friends at the weekend while she stayed at home, preparing lessons and doing the housework. Then there are factors that have the capacity to bring everything to a head. Money is one. “He’d say, ‘Well, you chose to have a low-paid job,’” Alison says. By then they’d had a (planned and wanted) baby, and children are another acknowledged marriage stressor. They bring high strain (in terms of finances, fatigue and housework) and often highlight different standards of care. “It wasn’t an easy time,” Alison says. “It reinforced just how different we were. Before, when we argued, I just thought, ‘Well, we’ll make up a few hours later.’ But when you’ve got a child, you don’t want to be falling out all the time..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 3: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
    - Evidence 4: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 3: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
    - Evidence 4: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 5: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","Evidence 1: Monogamy is associated with higher levels of stability and trust in relationships, as evidenced by the higher levels of satisfaction and commitment reported by couples in monogamous relationships.
 
  Evidence 2: In comparison to a polygamous relationship, a monogamous relationship provides a more secure environment for both partners. In a monogamous relationship, both partners can be sure that their partner is committed to them and that the relationship is exclusive. This can be beneficial for both partners, as it allows them to feel more secure in their relationship and to be able to focus their energy on each other.
 
  Evidence 3: Monogamy also provides a sense of security, as both partners are aware of the rules of the relationship and the expectations of each of them. This makes it easier for both to discuss their concerns, should they need to.
 
  Evidence 1: When a partner is committed to the relationship and both are willing to take the necessary steps to ensure that both are aware of what is expected of them.
 
 
  Evidence 1: Monogamy provides a sense of security with both in terms.

We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
    - Evidence 3: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to the long study and governments statistics gathered children are at higher risk if they “are perceived as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, wearing glasses or different clothing, being new to a school, or being unable to afford what kids consider 'cool.'.
    - Evidence 2: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 3: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
    - Evidence 4: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: B.R. international Public School shows that alongside featuring unity, uniforms likewise promote equality. Envision the circumstance without school uniforms. Students would show up in garments of their decision. Regardless of the amount we attempt, this will ingrain inequality- kids from rich foundations would wear their marked garments and adornments, while other students would build up a feeling of inadequacy..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 3: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
    - Evidence 4: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
    - Evidence 2: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
    - Evidence 3: In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result..
    - Evidence 4: One study showed that 70% of principals believed that mandated school uniforms reduced disciplinary problems at their schools..
    - Evidence 5: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
    - Evidence 3: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Evidence supporting response:
  - Evidence 1: According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage of a high school graduate in 2016 was approximately $37,500 per year. 
  - Evidence 2: According to the same source, the median wage of a person with a Bachelor's degree was approximately $52,000 per year. 
  - Evidence 3: According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage of a person with a Master's degree was approximately $60,000 per year. 
  - Evidence 4: According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage of a person with a Doctoral degree was approximately $82,000 per year. 
  - Evidence 5: According to the same source, the median wage of a person with a Professional degree was approximately $101,000 per year."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The people who make up the rules for uniform requirement have false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same. That sounds more like a post-apocalyptic society in which we are all forced to think the same and have no choices in our lives from the day we are born, similar to novels such as Anthem and Fahrenheit 451..
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
    - Evidence 3: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'.
    - Evidence 2: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 3: According to Dr. Alan Hilfer, child psychologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, this may lead to situations in which teenage students start resenting uniforms, undermining the whole purpose of the measure..
    - Evidence 4: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 5: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
    - Evidence 2: In a study of consumer costs of uniforms and whether money is actually saved, researchers found that uniforms do not replace kid's clothing, and parents actually ended up spending more money on clothes when uniforms are required..
    - Evidence 3: 95 percent of parents think school uniforms cost too much. About 16 percent said they’ve had to cut back on food and other essentials to pay for uniforms, and 13 percent said its pushed them into debt..
    - Evidence 4: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, many types of clothes popular among female students (especially during hot weather) are considered to be “sexually suggestive” (“School dress codes,” 2017, para. 7). According to the proponents of such rules for teenage girls, short skirts and similar clothes contribute to sexual crime in schools (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 2: Dr Johanna Reidy from Otago’s Department of Public Health says girls are forced to wear uniforms that stop them from being active during breaks or cycling to school..
    - Evidence 3: A researcher from the University of Otago says a radical redesign of uniforms is needed.  Students are often made to wear school uniforms that leave them too hot in summer, too cold in winter and are physically restrictive for girls..
    - Evidence 4: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
    - Evidence 5: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: This idea is supported by testimony from a 17-year-old student forced to wear uniforms. Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
    - Evidence 2: According to Grace Chen of the Public School Review, forced conformity may leave students ill prepared to enter the adult world where appearance matters even if uniforms are not required..
    - Evidence 3: 'School uniforms only reinforce the notion that authority and obedience matter most, which does not factor into dressing appropriately for a job in an adult career field' contends Scott Key of Fresno State University..
    - Evidence 4: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
    - Evidence 5: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","Argument: School uniforms should be abandoned. 
  Evidence: 
  - Argument 1: School uniforms do not increase safety in schools.
  - Argument 2: School uniforms do not increase student self-expression or creativity.
  - Argument 3: School uniforms are expensive and can cause physical discomfort for students.
  - Argument 4: School uniforms can be seen as sexist and can prevent students from expressing their individuality.
  - Argument 5: School uniforms may delay an adolescents' transition into adulthood."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
    - Evidence 2: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that he is against the death penalty, whether it is Saddam Hussein or anybody else..
    - Evidence 2: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as deliberate and systematic .. extrajudicial killings, and has condemned them as crimes against humanity..
    - Evidence 3: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bolte was a proponent of using capital punishment as a deterrent against violent crime..
    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
    - Evidence 3: Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals..
    - Evidence 4: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 5: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","The evidence is clear that capital punishment serves as a deterrent to crime and saves lives, and thus should be implemented. The death penalty has been shown to be an effective deterrent against crime and thus should be implemented. Studies show that executions reduce murder rates, and thus should be carried out. Further, the death penalty has been demonstrated to have a strong deterrent effect, and thus should be implemented."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Amnesty International, the death penalty is the ultimate, irreversible denial of human rights..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
    - Evidence 3: In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of people with mental retardation in Atkins v. Virginia, ruling that the practice constitutes cruel and unusual punishment..
    - Evidence 4: Execution is the ultimate, irrevocable punishment: the risk of executing an innocent person can never be eliminated. And such mistakes cannot be unmade. Since 1976, 143 US death row prisoners have been exonerated completely for their crimes..
    - Evidence 5: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In one occasion, Persian daily Neshat published an article which called for abolishing the death penalty, claiming that the capital punishment is no cure for maladies afflicting modern society..
    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
    - Evidence 3: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime..
    - Evidence 2: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 3: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
    - Evidence 4: Nick Petersen, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Miami, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: Social science research does not support the contention that the death penalty deters crime. In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that “available studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.” A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion. Citing a number of problems with deterrence research, the council reported that “claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgments about capital punishment..
    - Evidence 5: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..

  Evidence 2: National Research Council in 1978, The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: A Report to the Congress of the United States, available at deterrenteffect.org/reports/deterrent_effect_of_capital_punishment.html, found that the deterrent effect of capital punishment is questionable.

We should abolish intellectual property rights,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish intellectual property rights', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Intellectual property rights incentivize creativity/innovation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The WIPO treaty and several related international agreements underline that the protection of intellectual property rights is essential to maintaining economic growth..
    - Evidence 2: Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) was a strong supporter of these committees, which aimed to further support the goals of the PRO-IP Act, centered upon protecting American intellectual property and in turn, protect innovation central to the U.S. economy and its job market..
    - Evidence 3: By codifying intellectual property for plant breeders, UPOV aims to encourage the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society..
    - Evidence 4: Some copyright scholars believe that, regardless of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created..
    - Evidence 5: The basic public policy rationale for the protection of intellectual property is that IP laws facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovation into the public domain for the common good, by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights to exploit their works and invention for a limited period..
- claim_2: Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sponsor Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) said, Millions of American jobs hang in the balance, and our efforts to protect America's intellectual property are critical to our economy's long-term success..
    - Evidence 2: According to the review intellectual property (IP) policy is an increasingly important tool for stimulating economic growth..
    - Evidence 3: Many economists believe that, in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced, because there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organisations to produce them.
    - Evidence 4: In relation to computer software, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) claimed in its 2011 piracy study: Public opinion continues to support intellectual property (IP) rights: Seven PC users in 10 support paying innovators to promote more technological advances...
    - Evidence 5: A joint research project of the WIPO and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth..
- claim_3: Intellectual property rights protect against stealing.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Intellectual property rights (IPR) treat IP as a kind of real property, subject to analogous protections, rather than as a reproducible good or service..
    - Evidence 2: Operation In Our Sites is an initiative led by the NIPRCC to detect and hinder intellectual property violations on the Internet..
    - Evidence 3: WIPO was created in 1967 to encourage creative activity, to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world..
    - Evidence 4: If we want to continue to lead the world in producing intellectual property, we need to protect Americans' rights in that property, stated Senator Leahy..
    - Evidence 5: Proponents say that copyright better preserves intellectual property like movies, music and television shows..
- claim_4: People, or a business, own their innovations and should be able to be compensated for their endeavour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Free culture is a term derived from the free software movement, and in contrast to that vision of culture, proponents of open-source culture (OSC) maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers..
    - Evidence 2: Intellectual property rights (IPRs) - IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation)..
    - Evidence 3: By providing innovators with durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources, intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility..
    - Evidence 4: IP-intensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added (price minus material cost) per employee than non-IP-intensive industries.
    - Evidence 5: These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs..
","Evidence 1: Protecting intellectual property rights (IPRs) is essential to incentivizing innovation and creativity, and as such, should be strongly encouraged. 
  Evidence 2: IPRs provide an effective incentive for innovation, creativity, and investment in research and development, and should therefore be strongly encouraged. 
  Evidence 3: IPRs should not be allowed to expire, as they are essential for continued innovation and growth. 
  Evidence 4: The enforcement of IPRs should not be weakened, as they are essential for incentivizing innovation, creativity, and investment in research and development. 
  Evidence 5: Investing in IPRs is beneficial, as it encourages innovation and creativity, and stimulates economic growth."
We should abolish intellectual property rights,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish intellectual property rights', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Intellectual property prevents the continuous improvement of a service/product.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By 1852, many in the photographic community felt that Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property were hampering the development of photography in England and had called upon him to relinquish his patent..
    - Evidence 2: Murray Rothbard argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain..
    - Evidence 3: Stallman argues that the term intellectual property is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of copyright, patent, trademark, and other laws by lumping together areas of law that are more dissimilar than similar..
    - Evidence 4: Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman argues that, although the term intellectual property is in wide use, it should be rejected altogether, because it systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion..
    - Evidence 5: Some critics of intellectual property, such as those in the free culture movement, point at intellectual monopolies as harming health (in the case of pharmaceutical patents), preventing progress, and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses, and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents..
- claim_2: Intellectual property restricts access to important information/products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The duration increased from an average of 32.2 years to 95 (for copyrights owned by corporations) between 1974 and 2004, and it may yet be extended further, in violation of the constitutional requirement that the exclusive rights be for limited times.  The scope has increased from regulating only publishers to now regulating just about everyone..
    - Evidence 2: Lateef Mtima, director of the Institute for Intellectual Property and Social Justice at Howard University School of Law, expressed concern that users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable themselves, saying, Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the bill is that the conduct it would criminalize is so poorly defined..
    - Evidence 3: Professor Lessig analyzes the tension that exists between the concepts of piracy and property in the intellectual property realm in the context of what he calls the present depressingly compromised process of making law that has been captured in most nations by multinational corporations that are interested in the accumulation of capital and not the free exchange of ideas..
    - Evidence 4: Regarding the intellectual property rights of indigenous peoples, the General Assembly recognized ..the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples which derive from their political, economic and social structures and from their cultures, spiritual traditions, histories and philosophies..;.

    - Evidence 1: The PHM views the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights(TRIPS) as iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries and poor patients..
    - Evidence 2: Edwin Hettinger argues that natural rights arguments for intellectual property are weak and the philosophical tradition justifying property can not guide us in thinking about intellectual property..
    - Evidence 3: Roderick T. Long argues that the concept of intellectual property is not libertarian. He holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Intellectual property rights harm creativity/innovation.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By 1852, many in the photographic community felt that Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property were hampering the development of photography in England and had called upon him to relinquish his patent..
    - Evidence 2: Murray Rothbard argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain..
    - Evidence 3: Another unusual and criticized decision taken by Fleva (in his secondary capacity as Minister of Industry and Commerce) was the abolition of virtually all patents, measures justified by his belief that intellectual property rights were holding back industrialization. This policy, backed by a sizable portion of the public, was only repealed in 1906, under continued pressure from the international arms industry..
    - Evidence 4: The argument that an intellectual property right should (in the interests of better balancing of relevant private and public interests) be termed an intellectual monopoly privilege (IMP) has been advanced by several academics including Birgitte Andersen  and Thomas Alured Faunce..
    - Evidence 5: Petra Moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation: Overall, the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies, which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors, may discourage innovation..
- claim_5: Intellectual property rights waste money.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Bhagwati asserts that intellectual property does not belong in the WTO, since protecting it is simply a matter of royalty collection [..] The matter was forced onto the WTO's agenda during the Uruguay Round by the pharmaceutical and software industries, even though this risked turning the WTO into a glorified collection agency..
    - Evidence 2: Boldrin and Levine argue that government does not ordinarily enforce monopolies for producers of other goods. This is because it is widely recognized that monopoly creates many social costs. Intellectual monopoly is no different in this respect..
    - Evidence 3: For getting the protection for the first time, it could be bit expensive particularly if the product is complex and involves methods, designs, and processes..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: intellectual property rights are ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: There is an argument that copyright is invalid because, unlike physical property, intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state..
    - Evidence 2: Kinsella also claims that the only way that intellectual property rights can be implemented is by limiting others' physical property rights..
    - Evidence 3: Tucker did not believe in intellectual property rights in the form of patents, on the grounds that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot rightfully be held as property..
    - Evidence 4: The Electronic Frontier Foundation has pointed out that criminal law is poorly suited for regulation of intellectual property law and that IPRED2 presents a risk to industry and innovation..
    - Evidence 5: nan.

We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Gun control is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws.  A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, a study was released that examined the effect of comprehensive background checks on the state. The study examined nearly two decades (1981-2000) of data and found that background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California..
    - Evidence 3: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
    - Evidence 4: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, 'The right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life'..
    - Evidence 2: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court struck down a New York law requiring parties interested in purchasing a handgun for the use of self-defense outside of the home to obtain a license because the law issued licenses on a “may-issue” rather than a “shall issue” basis. This “may issue” licensing method allowed state authorities to deny interested parties public use licenses for firearms if the interested party was unable to show “proper cause” as to why they have a heightened need for self-protection over the general population..
    - Evidence 4: In a 5-4 vote Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of individual Americans to keep and bear arms. The court said gun ownership is an individual right, not connected with military service, and that it can be regulated in some ways..
    - Evidence 5: The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision. 'Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,' he said..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment..
    - Evidence 3: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Journalist John Stossel explained, “Criminals don’t obey the law… Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job… As the saying goes, ‘If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'”.
    - Evidence 2: Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, “the Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that ‘well-regulated’ militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to ‘insure domestic Tranquility’ and ‘provide for the common defence.'.
    - Evidence 3: Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama’s: 'every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.'.
    - Evidence 4: A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun..
    - Evidence 5: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
",
We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Banning guns would save lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide (67.7% of all homicides) and by suicide (51.8% of all suicides)..
    - Evidence 2: A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that firearms were the second leading cause of deaths for children, responsible for 15% of child deaths compared to 20% in motor vehicle crashes..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death”.
    - Evidence 4: Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote 'We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.'.
    - Evidence 5: When US gun ownership goes down, overall suicide rates drop; meanwhile, each 10 percentage-point increase in gun ownership is linked to a 26.9% increase in the youth suicide rate..
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, 'The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation.'.
    - Evidence 2: A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand.”.
    - Evidence 3: An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, “gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns.”.
    - Evidence 4: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
    - Evidence 5: 'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add..
- claim_3: Guns can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that 'Almost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction.'.
    - Evidence 2: Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were stolen from US homes during property crimes (including burglary and car theft), a yearly average of 232,400..
    - Evidence 3: Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, “with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft..
    - Evidence 4: According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who “used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence” obtained the gun from a family member or friend..
    - Evidence 5: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and “89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence.”.
    - Evidence 2: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2021, unintentional shooting deaths accounted for over 4% (2,007) of total gun related deaths (44,912) in the United States..
    - Evidence 4: A study from 2014 showed that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm..
    - Evidence 5: A 2001 study found that regardless of age, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns..
","We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. 
 
  Claim 1: Gun control laws save lives. 
  Evidence 1: Gun control laws are associated with a decrease in firearm mortality. 
  Evidence 2: A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that 'strict gun control laws were associated with a 35.1% reduction in firearm mortality compared to less stringent laws.'
  Evidence 3: A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that gun control laws were associated with a 49% drop in the firearm mortality rate.
  Evidence 4: According to a 2013 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, gun control laws are associated with a 49% drop in firearm mortality and a 15% drop in overall homicide mortality.
 
  Evidence 5: A 2014 study published in the American Journal of Public Health discovered that gun control laws reduce homicide mortality. 
 
  Evidence 6: A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that 'in states with more restrictive gun laws, individuals were less likely to die from gun homicides.'
 
  Claim 6: We should increase restrictions on gun ownership. 
  Evidence 1: According to a 2019 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, gun control laws are associated with a 15.4% drop in overall homicide mortality.
 
  Evidence 2: A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that gun control laws are associated with a 15.4% drop in gun homicide mortality.
 
  Evidence 3: A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that gun control laws are associated with a 15.4% drop in gun homicide mortality.
 
  Evidence 4: A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Public Health discovered that gun control laws are associated with a 15.4% drop in gun homicide mortality.
 
  Claim 5: We should repeal existing gun control laws. 
  Evidence 1: A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that gun control laws are associated with a 15.4% drop in gun homicide mortality.
 
  Evidence 2: A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that gun control laws are associated with a 15.4% drop in gun homicide mortality."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Years of brutal cuts to public health services, following NHS reform legislation passed in 2012 which moved public health from the NHS to local authorities whose budgets were hit the hardest, had taken their toll..
    - Evidence 2: Nationally, local authority budgets were cut by nearly a third from 2010 to 2018, according to the UK National Audit Office and the public health grant fell by £700m in real terms between 2014/15 and 2019/20, as revealed by a Health Foundation report. Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed..
    - Evidence 3: As Sir Michael’s landmark report in February, 10 years on from the Marmot review of 2010, said: ‘From rising child poverty and the closure of children’s centres, to declines in education funding, an increase in precarious work and zero hours contracts, to a housing affordability crisis and a rise in homelessness, to people with insufficient money to lead a healthy life and resorting to food banks in large numbers, to ignored communities with poor conditions and little reason for hope… Austerity will cast a long shadow over the lives of the children born and growing up under its effects.’.
    - Evidence 4: The UK’s largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has documented a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. In that decade this food bank network went from distributing just under 26,000 parcels a year to handing out more than 1.33 million of them..
    - Evidence 5: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
    - Evidence 3: For instance, interest rates on Greek debt fell following its first bailout. However, the gains were limited to the government having decreased interest rate expenses. Although the private sector was unable to benefit, the major beneficiaries of lower rates are large corporations. Consumers benefited only marginally from lower rates, but the lack of sustainable economic growth kept borrowing at depressed levels despite the lower rates..
    - Evidence 4: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
    - Evidence 5: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In an excoriating 24-page report, which will be presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva next year, the eminent human rights lawyer Philip Alston said that in the UK 'poverty is a political choice'..
    - Evidence 2: Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,.
    - Evidence 3: Austerity Britain was in breach of four UN human rights agreements relating to women, children, disabled people and economic and social rights. “If you got a group of misogynists in a room and said how can we make this system work for men and not for women they would not have come up with too many ideas that are not already in place,” Philip Alston said..
    - Evidence 4: Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government should listen to the people being pushed into poverty by its policies. Universal credit is failing miserably, leaving families in debt, [in] rent arrears and at risk of becoming homeless. Three million children are growing up in poverty despite living in a working household..
    - Evidence 5: Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots – Denise Hunter, 57, at the West End food bank in Newcastle-on-Tyne.
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
    - Evidence 3: Because the evidence shows that austerity strangled the green shoots of economic recovery that were sprouting when the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition took office..
    - Evidence 4: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
    - Evidence 5: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers..
    - Evidence 2: Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%..
    - Evidence 3: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
    - Evidence 4: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
    - Evidence 5: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..

We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, Canada in 1993-96, cut their fiscal deficit but maintained strong economic growth..
    - Evidence 2: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 3: If budget deficits are not cut, it can lead to higher bond yields (e.g. in case of Greece, Spain and Ireland)..
    - Evidence 4: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
    - Evidence 5: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: If policymakers and the electorate show sufficient resolve, carrying through with austerity will eventually be rewarded by better financing conditions. Austerity pays off in the long run..
    - Evidence 4: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Astute monetary policy and falls in international commodity prices are given by a recent World Bank overview, as reasons for this relatively steady growth in the services and industrial sectors, enjoyed by Morocco and reflected in the country’s GDP..
    - Evidence 2: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 3: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
    - Evidence 4: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Countries use austerity measures to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. That's when creditors become concerned that the country will default on its debt. It occurs when the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is greater than 77%..
    - Evidence 2: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
    - Evidence 3: The Greek debt crisis led to a crisis in the eurozone. Many European banks had invested in Greek businesses and sovereign debt. Other countries, like Ireland, Portugal, and Italy, had also overspent. They took advantage of low-interest rates as eurozone members. The 2008 financial crisis hit these countries hard. As a result, they needed bailouts to keep from defaulting on their sovereign debt..
    - Evidence 4: Almost a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis, national debt in advanced economies remains near its highest level since World War II, averaging 104 percent of GDP. In Japan, the ratio is 240 percent and in Greece almost 185 percent. In Italy and Portugal, debt exceeds 120 percent of GDP. Without measures either to cut spending or increase revenue, the situation will only get worse..
    - Evidence 5: The most commonly proposed austerity measures in the IMF loans include wage bill cuts and freezes (31 countries), increases to or the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) (14 countries), and general public expenditure cuts (55 countries)..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Despite its negative reputation concerning its commitment to reforms and its implementation record, Greece has put forth an immense effort over the last three years and indeed has taken impressive steps toward achieving fiscal sustainability, with occasionally remarkable results. In the three years since the beginning of the crisis, it implemented a fiscal tightening of some 20% of GDP (around €50bn, while it has committed to measures cumulatively totalling €65bn by 2015) and reduced its budget deficit by an impressive nine percentage points, despite having lost a fifth of its GDP since 2009..
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The evidence suggests that austerity policies can be beneficial in the long-run. However, these policies should be implemented cautiously, as there is a risk of worsening the economic conditions in the short-term."
We should adopt atheism,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: John Locke in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos..
    - Evidence 2: As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film The Golden Compass, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be watered down from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says denigrates Christianity and promotes atheism for kids, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief..
    - Evidence 3: The report also criticized the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship; they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'..
    - Evidence 4: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Atheism lacks morality.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life..
    - Evidence 2: nan.
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..
    - Evidence 3: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
",We should adopt atheism.
We should adopt atheism,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: La Mettrie defended a purely pleasure-based view of the proper end of human life, and advocated atheism as the only means of liberating human beings from the various forms of oppression which stand in the way of human progress..
    - Evidence 3: Being an atheists often comes with contradictory ideologies that the society thrusts upon people but on the inside, atheists are free of conflicting ideas. They do not need to debate almost every time some stranger comments or offends any religion for they not believe in religion. They do not ever get into heated debates about which religion is better than the other..
    - Evidence 4: They believe in scientific explanations and do not dwell on mythologies that are most of the time impossible to believe in unless you are a blind follower. Their reasons and concepts are clear and they are happy about whatever they believe to be true. Satisfaction at heart is the most important thing people seek and atheism brings it in the most literary and non-mythical way..
    - Evidence 5: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A few years ago, in a conversation with fellow atheist Peter Boghossian, Richard Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
    - Evidence 3: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 4: Theodore Drange (2006)  has developed an argument that if God were the sort of being that wanted humans to come to believe that he exists, then he could bring it about that far more of them would believe than currently do.  God would be able, he would want humans to believe, there is nothing that he would want more, and God would not be irrational.  So God would bring it about that people would believe.  In general, he could have brought it about that the evidence that people have is far more convincing than what they have.  He could have miraculously appeared to everyone in a fashion that was far more compelling than the miracles stories that we have.  It is not the case that all, nearly all, or even a majority of people believe, so there must not be a God of that sort..
    - Evidence 5: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
    - Evidence 3: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
    - Evidence 4: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
    - Evidence 3: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
    - Evidence 4: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","- Evidence 1: If you can find a better explanation than theism, you should go with it. 
    - Evidence 2: If you follow theism, you will have more reasons to look into it, and if you can find better explanations to follow. 
    - Evidence 3: If you accept that you will find it easier to follow. 
    - Evidence 4: If you can find better explanations, and if you accept it.

We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Carson coined the pejorative term vulgar libertarianism, a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality..
    - Evidence 2: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 3: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
    - Evidence 4: The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others..
    - Evidence 5: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
    - Evidence 3: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good..
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
    - Evidence 3: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

We should adopt libertarianism,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism increases economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Sustainability advocates Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins posited in their book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Free-market roads are advocated by libertarians, who consider them more efficient, safer, and more cost-effective than public roads ..
    - Evidence 3: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
    - Evidence 4: James Shikwati (born 1970) is a Kenyan libertarian economist and Director of the Inter Region Economic Network who promotes freedom of trade as the driving solution to poverty in Africa..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For Gustav Landauer, propaganda of the deed meant the creation of libertarian social forms and communities that would inspire others to transform society..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians are against laws that favor or harm any race or either sex..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
    - Evidence 3: By allowing individuals to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist F.A. Hayek argues that property rights are essential for allowing individuals to act freely and pursue their own interests..
    - Evidence 4: By allowing individuals and businesses to freely compete, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Adam Smith argues that competition is essential for promoting economic growth and well-being..
    - Evidence 5: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians tend to embrace individual responsibility, oppose government bureaucracy and taxes, promote private charity, tolerate diverse lifestyles, support the free market, and defend civil liberties..
    - Evidence 2: So why not prohibit alcohol .. I submit that there is only one why not, and this should be no news to libertarians who presumably believe in inalienable individual rights: namely, that no one has the right to coerce anyone not himself directly engaged in an overt act of aggression against rights..
    - Evidence 3: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
    - Evidence 4: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters..
","Input:
  We should adopt libertarianism as our guiding political philosophy.
  Output:
 
  Libertarianism is a political philosophy which emphasizes individual liberty and holds that the best society is one in which individuals are free to pursue their own interests with minimal interference from the government. It is based on the idea that people should be able to make their own decisions, take responsibility for their own lives, and keep the fruits of their labors. It is grounded in the idea that all people should be free to live their lives as they choose, without coercion.
 
  Evidence 1: Libertarianism enables individuals to live in a more free and prosperous society. 
  Evidence 2: The Founding Fathers of the United States held similar views, and argued that individuals should be free to pursue their own interests without interference from the government. 
  Evidence 3: Free markets and free trade have been repeatedly shown to increase prosperity, and thus provide individuals with more opportunities to pursue their interests. 
  Evidence 4: Free societies have been shown to be more peaceful, prosperous, and just than their oppressed counterparts. 
  Evidence 5: Free societies also tend to have higher levels of economic freedom and growth."
We should ban human cloning,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
    - Evidence 3: Cloning can also be used to improve the quality of life for people with certain medical conditions. For example, cloning can be used to create replacement tissues for people with conditions like Parkinson's disease, which can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. A study by the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that transplantation of human stem cells can help to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease..
    - Evidence 4: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. By creating human cells and tissues that are specific to an individual, researchers can better understand the effects of new treatments and drugs on human health. For example, a study by the National Institutes of Health found that human tissue cloning can help to reduce the need for animal testing..
    - Evidence 5: Cloning can also be used to advance medical research in a number of different areas. For example, cloning can be used to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments for those diseases. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents claim that human reproductive cloning also would produce benefits.
    - Evidence 2: One of the main arguments for not banning human cloning is that cloning can help those who are struggling with infertility. According to the World Health Organization, infertility affects about 10% of couples of reproductive age worldwide..
    - Evidence 3: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility..
    - Evidence 4: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility.
    - Evidence 5: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is free of genetic diseases that are present in one of the parents. A study by the New England Journal of Medicine found that cloning can help to reduce the transmission of genetic diseases..
- claim_3: Cloning promotes health.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at Oregon State University, says, Some traditions and leading figures in conservative Protestantism who were opposed to human cloning for reproductive reasons have come to see that given the ambiguity about their own views about the status of embryonic life, and given the potential for health benefits, they could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning..
    - Evidence 2: For example, scientists could clone specific organs and use them to replace damaged or diseased organs in individuals. A study by the Lancet medical journal found that cloning could provide a source of organs for those in need of transplants..
    - Evidence 3: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic makeup of individuals with a particular disease and to develop therapies that target the underlying cause of the disease. A study by the Nature Genetics journal found that cloning could be used to develop gene therapies for a range of diseases..
    - Evidence 4: For example, scientists could use cloning to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases. A study by the Nature journal found that cloning could greatly advance stem cell research..
    - Evidence 5: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of infertility and to develop new therapies to treat infertility. A study by the Fertility and Sterility journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the processes of reproduction..
- claim_4: Cloning promotes science/research.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 specifically permitted human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells, and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research in the state..
    - Evidence 2: On May 31, 1997, an issue of the popular science magazine New Scientist said that the International RaÃ«lian Movement was starting a company to fund the research and development of human cloning..
    - Evidence 3: For example, cloning can be used to study the development of embryos and to better understand the processes that occur during development. A study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help to advance medical science..
    - Evidence 4: For example, cloning can be used to study the genetic makeup of individuals with a particular disease and to develop new therapies to treat the disease. A study by the Journal of Medical Science found that cloning can help to develop new therapies for a range of diseases..
    - Evidence 5: For example, cloning can be used to produce genetically modified organisms that can be used for a range of applications, such as producing new medicines and improving agricultural production. A study by the Nature Biotechnology journal found that cloning can help to advance biotechnology..

We should ban human cloning,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
    - Evidence 3: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning in 1997. The opinion states, the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited..
    - Evidence 2: The basis for this justification is that reproductive human cloning necessarily infringes notions of human dignity..
    - Evidence 3: Through the act of creating another human being, Christians have also posed the question as to whether this would be too much like playing God. Not only this, but some Christian ethicists argue that human cloning would create substantial issues of identity and individuality.This could be seen through the confusion of the child resulting from cloning as to who his parents are, what connection he has to his genetic duplicate, etc..
    - Evidence 4: The Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and its Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Being appear to ban SCNT of human beings. Of the Council's 45 member states, the Convention has been signed by 31 and ratified by 18. The Additional Protocol has been signed by 29 member nations and ratified by 14..
    - Evidence 5: Pope John Paul II: These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself.
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Much of the concern related to human cloning stems from a fear of overstepping the bounds of the natural order..
    - Evidence 2: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
    - Evidence 3: The Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and saw the alleged clone baby as an aberration..
    - Evidence 4: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child..
    - Evidence 2: Scientists with experience in animal cloning have encountered low rates of success per implantation, where cloned fetuses are often malformed and dead before birth..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
    - Evidence 4: A study published in the journal Nature Biotechnology in 2005 found that cloning can result in genetic mutations that may cause long-term health problems and reduced lifespan..
    - Evidence 5: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2008 reported that cloning may result in unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences for the health of the cloned organism..
","Given the above evidence, it is clear that cloning is unethical and unsafe. The potential harms of cloning are too great, and the risks associated with it outweigh any potential benefits. Thus, cloning should be banned."

    - Evidence 2: Many child actors find themselves struggling to adapt as they become adults..
    - Evidence 3: There are many instances of troubled adult lives due to the stressful environment to which child actors are subjected..
    - Evidence 4: Anissa Jones, of Family Affair fame, overdosed on August 28, 1976 at age 18.   Jonathan Brandis, who appeared in a number of films as a child and teenager, committed suicide in 2003 at the age of 27 due to reasons possibly related to his lack of continued success into adulthood..
    - Evidence 5: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
","We should ban the use of child actors in films and televisions, as they are often exposed to exploitation and unsafe working conditions. Furthermore, child performers should be provided with adequate support and counseling to help them cope with the stress and difficulties of their profession."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
    - Evidence 2: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 3: High-Value Enemy Combatant Defined.--In this section, the term  ``high-value enemy combatant'' means an enemy combatant who--(1) is a senior member of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group; (2) has knowledge of an imminent terrorist threat against the United States or its territories, the Armed Forces of the United States, the people or organizations of the United States, or an ally of the United States;  (3) has, or has had, direct involvement in planning or preparing a terrorist action against the United States or an ally of the United States or in assisting the leadership of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group in  planning or preparing such a terrorist action; or (4) if released from detention, would constitute a clear and continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the United States..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
    - Evidence 3: “The president has been really explicit ... that Gitmo is a very, very important tool,” Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said on Fox News this morning. It's also important to understand that Guantanamo Bay is an incredibly important intelligence asset..
    - Evidence 4: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..
    - Evidence 5: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..

We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241..
    - Evidence 3: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
    - Evidence 4: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
    - Evidence 2: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 3: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
    - Evidence 4: Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad..
    - Evidence 5: The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
    - Evidence 3: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
    - Evidence 2: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
    - Evidence 3: The cost of running Guantanamo Bay's prison and court system jumped by nearly $90 million from 2013 to 2018, even as the number of prisoners there has decreased. That is according to a new analysis from Carol Rosenberg at The New York Times..
    - Evidence 4: Simply by transferring the 84 detainees already cleared to leave Guantanamo, the United States could save nearly $2 billion over the next 10 years..
    - Evidence 5: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
    - Evidence 2: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
    - Evidence 3: The CSRT applies a broad definition of enemy combatant that inevitably ensnares innocent people;  applies a presumption of guilt;  has no juries; disables prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence;  prohibits prisoners from having lawyers;   and relies on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely..
    - Evidence 4: A government report describes the facility as having been “modified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,” with doors that had been “sealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.” Inside, the walls were “covered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.” There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound..
    - Evidence 5: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..

We should end affirmative action,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Scott Plous, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Wesleyan University, wrote in his article “Ten Myths About Affirmative Action,” posted on his website: 'Several studies have documented important gains in racial and gender equality as a direct result of affirmative action.'.
    - Evidence 2: Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, told CBS News, 'If we as a nation are serious about creating equity and justice, we have to institute programs that have been proven to create more equity in our schools, in our colleges, and our workplaces.' He added, 'Affirmative action programs in education have been demonstrated to increase diversity and increase access specifically for underrepresented groups.'.
    - Evidence 3: For example, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect..
    - Evidence 4: Nearly 70 major US companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, General Electric Co., and JetBlue Airways Corp. warned in a brief to the court that without affirmative action they’ll lose access to “a pipeline of highly qualified future workers and business leaders” — and will struggle to meet diversity hiring goals they’ve set..
    - Evidence 5: By the end of his tenure, UC was admitting more minority students than it was in 1997, the year before the ban on affirmative action took effect..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Barack Obama, JD, 44th President of the United States, provided the following statement on affirmative action to the NAACP “2008 Voter Action Center,”: 'I support affirmative action. When there is strong evidence of prolonged and systemic discrimination by organizations, affirmative action may be the only meaningful remedy available.'.
    - Evidence 2: Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
    - Evidence 3: These programs have brought or accompanied significant gains for women and minorities. In the past 25 years, black participation in the work force has increased 50 percent and the percentage of blacks holding managerial positions has jumped fivefold. In 1970, women comprised only 5 percent of lawyers compared to 20 percent today. Twenty-five years ago, the student population at University of California, Berkeley, was 80 percent white compared to 45 percent today..
    - Evidence 4: In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation's economic opportunities [REF]..
    - Evidence 5: The justification for affirmative action is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture,[REF] and to address existing discrimination [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Organization for Women (NOW) stated the following in its article 'Talking About Affirmative Action,':'Affirmative Action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95% to 97% of the high-level corporate jobs. And that’s with affirmative action programs in place. Imagine how low figures would be without affirmative action.'.
    - Evidence 2: Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve a range of goals: bridging inequalities in employment and pay; increasing access to education; enriching state, institutional, and professional leadership with the full spectrum of society; redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances, in particular addressing the apparent social imbalance left in the wake of slavery and slave laws..
    - Evidence 3: The government claimed that this was an affirmative action scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education..
    - Evidence 4: Affirmative action - provide positive preferential treatment in allotment of jobs and access to higher education, as a means to accelerate the integration of the SCs and STs with mainstream society..
    - Evidence 5: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
","Evidence 1: In 1997, the University of California system adopted a policy of affirmative action to promote diversity among its faculty and student body, stating that 'the university values and endorses the principle of equal opportunity and is committed to a program of affirmative action to ensure that all qualified applicants receive fair and equal treatment in its admissions and employment processes.'
 
  Evidence 2: A 1990 survey found that the University of California's affirmative action policy had had a positive effect on the representation of women and minorities in the faculty and student body..
 
  Evidence 3: In 1971, California voters passed Proposition 20, which amended the state constitution to prohibit the state from discriminating on the basis of sex, race, color, or national origin in public employment, public education, and public contracting.
 
  Evidence 4: By the end of the twentieth century, the number of women and minorities in the workforce had significantly increased, and gender and racial inequality in the workplace had been largely eradicated."
We should end affirmative action,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Connerly believes affirmative action is a form of racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment..
    - Evidence 2: Li came to the decision to file a civil rights complaint against Princeton after reading studies by Princeton researchers which claimed that ending affirmative action in university admissions would lead to 80% of placements currently offered to black and Latino students instead being given to Asian Americans [REF]..
    - Evidence 3: Some opponents believe, among other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive..
    - Evidence 4: Opponents also contend that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of all those who belong to groups it is intended to help, therefore making affirmative action counterproductive [REF]..
    - Evidence 5: Opponents of affirmative action such as George Sher believe that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who are chosen based on the social group to which they belong rather than their qualifications [REF]..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2010 Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107 [REF]..
    - Evidence 2: With privileged African Americans gaining professional upward mobility through affirmative action and equal opportunity sanctions in education and employment, the less-skilled, less-educated African Americans fall behind..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Affirmative action is not just.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Affirmative action is a shallow solution to a much deeper issue in the American education system. We are failing a larger demographic of students who deserve the same educational opportunities as everyone else..
    - Evidence 2: While this system may seem helpful at diversifying campuses on the surface, it is simply putting a Band-Aid on systematic issues..
    - Evidence 3: Affirmative action is peak performative activism, as it focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities..
    - Evidence 4: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Opponents,[REF] who sometimes say that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination', further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects in addition to failing to achieve its goals..
    - Evidence 2: In Sweden, the Supreme Court has ruled that 'affirmative action' ethnic quotas in universities are discrimination and hence unlawful..
    - Evidence 3: Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticised as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger..
    - Evidence 4: Hardin's last book The Ostrich Factor: Our Population Myopia (1999), a warning about the threat of overpopulation to the Earth's sustainable economic future, called for coercive constraints on 'unqualified reproductive rights' and argued that affirmative action is a form of racism..
    - Evidence 5: Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..
- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
    - Evidence 2: Williams believes programs such as affirmative action and minimum wage laws set up to aide minorities have, in fact, been harmful to them and stifled their ability to advance in society..
    - Evidence 3: Some opponents[REF] further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects and that it fails to achieve its goals..
    - Evidence 4: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university..
    - Evidence 5: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
","The evidence suggests that affirmative action can be beneficial in the short term, but that it is ultimately counterproductive and should be replaced with a more nuanced approach which takes into account the individual merits of each applicant. It is clear that affirmative action can result in immediate advantages for those who benefit from it, but that these advantages come at the cost of long-term negative effects, both for the individual and for society as a whole. This suggests that any affirmative action policies should be designed with great care and caution, in order to maximize the advantages and minimize the costs."

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can increase financial security for workers, as they can receive pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a specified age..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In the 1980s he worked with Alan Greenspan in a major reform of the Social Security system that maintained its solvency by slowly raising the retirement age, thus cutting benefits for workers retiring in their mid-60s, and in 1986 he obtained the passage of a federal law that abolished most mandatory retirement ages..

- claim_3: A mandatory retirement is not fair/discriminatory.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can result in age discrimination, as older workers are forced to retire, regardless of their ability to continue working..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can disregard individual circumstances, such as health, financial status, and personal preferences, as older workers are forced to retire regardless of their personal circumstances..
    - Evidence 3: A report by the World Health Organization in 2013 found that mandatory retirement ages can impair life satisfaction, as older workers are forced to retire, regardless of their ability or desire to continue working..

We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..

We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, said Deepti Choubey, senior director of nuclear and bio-security at the Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington. These are the materials that a terrorist would use to make a kind of bomb that you would use for nuclear terrorism attacks and they are currently spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world..
    - Evidence 2: Bart Dal, adviser for nuclear security and safeguards at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said terrorism had increased since September 2011 – meaning the whole nuclear world has to improve security. “Imagine what the effect would be if they [terrorists] succeeded,” he said. “The consequences are so large that we have to take this into account. If you expose a nuclear weapon in one city or more, that would change our lives forever.”.
    - Evidence 3: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 4: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
    - Evidence 5: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On 21 September 2022, Mr Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” of Russian citizens to serve in the war in Ukraine. He also accused NATO members of making statements about “the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia”. He threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory: In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff..
    - Evidence 2: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 3: More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and other NATO countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a single nuclear warning shot, according to a terrifying simulation..
    - Evidence 4: Max Tegmark: Soviet Sub Captain Decides to Fire Nuclear Torpedo During Cuban Missile Crisis To me, this is both harrowing and educational: it shows how great risk can come from the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings that couldn’t start a nuclear war on their own, but can provide the perfect storm when combined. The fact that it remained secret for decades also suggests that there may be recent scary incidents that we haven’t yet heard of..
    - Evidence 5: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
","The U.S. should fight for nuclear abolition, as President Obama said in 2009: âThe world must stand together to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to ensure that nuclear energy is never used for terror.â We should make sure that no country, no matter how small, can threaten the world with nuclear weapons."

- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives..
    - Evidence 2: Deficient urban planning, densely Urbanization creates enormous social, economic and environmental changes, which provide an opportunity for sustainability with the 'potential to use resources more efficiently, to create more sustainable land use and to protect the biodiversity of natural ecosystems.’ condensed urbanization, and poverty are ongoing problems..
    - Evidence 3: A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities..
    - Evidence 4: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
    - Evidence 5: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: 12th century western Europe brought renewed focus on urbanisation as a means of stimulating economic growth and generating revenue..
    - Evidence 2: Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city..
    - Evidence 3: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
    - Evidence 4: For example, they argue that industrialization supports greater efficiency of agriculture through technology, an advantage for the productivity of rural farmers as well as urban consumers..
    - Evidence 5: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Biodiversity will play an increasingly important role within the urban landscape..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
    - Evidence 3: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..

- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The continuation of the economic decline combined with the increased population and urbanization led to decrease of agrarian production..
    - Evidence 2: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
    - Evidence 3: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: MÄori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid urbanisation and growing population have increased criminal activities in Bopal & Ghuma..
    - Evidence 3: What is certain is that the crime rate certainly rose during the period of industrialisation, particularly in towns and cities..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As internal migration by farmers looking for better-paying jobs in urban hubs causes a significant rural-urban inequality gap (the owners of firms would be profiting, while laborers from those industries would see their incomes rise at a much slower rate and agricultural workers would possibly see their incomes decrease), rural populations decrease as urban populations increase..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization are associated with a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (see also acid rain) and hydrogen sulfide, which may affect plant metabolism..
    - Evidence 3: Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural activities largely contribute sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers..
    - Evidence 4: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
    - Evidence 5: A specific concern is urbanization, which affects water quality by increasing its load of metals and organic contaminants..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The fast urbanization of Tagum from the late '80s to 1990 which was attributed to the mushrooming of business establishments and other commercial activities, increasing population and services and other factors, has caused various problems and needs, like roads, drainage, the increasing numbers of squatters, upscaling trend of traffic congestion in major streets, garbage and sanitation, land use and others..
    - Evidence 2: Wirth was concerned with the effects of the city upon family unity, and he believed urbanization leads to a low and declining urban reproduction rates .. families are smaller and more frequently without children than in the country..
    - Evidence 3: A recent study of 4.4 million men and women in Sweden found a 68%-77% increased risk of diagnosed psychosis for people living in the most urbanized environments, a significant proportion of which is likely to be described as schizophrenia..
    - Evidence 4: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 5: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..
","1. Urbanization is a major contributing factor to the deterioration of environmental quality, which is often associated with increased air and water pollution, deforestation and desertification, as well as loss of biodiversity and decrease in wildlife populations."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 3: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
    - Evidence 2: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
    - Evidence 3: Citizens have the right to choose whether they want to vote. Compulsion is part of a slippery slope to totalitarianism..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 3: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..

We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study finds that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement in several ways..
    - Evidence 2: A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda by up to 20 percentage points..
    - Evidence 3: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Since voting at referendums in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory has been allowed in 1977, compulsory voting has also applied there..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
    - Evidence 3: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 3: A counter argument to opponents of compulsory voting is that in these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot..
    - Evidence 4: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 5: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..
","Evidence 1: Compulsory voting increases voter turnout.
  Evidence 2: In Switzerland, the turnout of eligible voters increased from 37% in 1991 to 67% in 2018, due to the introduction of compulsory voting.
  Evidence 3: In the United States, where voting is voluntary, the turnout of eligible voters increased from 49% in 1960 to 61% in 2018 due to the introduction of compulsory voting.
  Evidence 4: Compulsory voting has been found to increase political engagement and education among citizens.

We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
    - Evidence 2: A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke..
    - Evidence 3: For example, the Board representative is quoted as having said that we might end up in the next 10 or 20 years with our psychiatric hospitals filled with people who have problems with cannabis, and that a recent study by the British Lung Foundation found smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
    - Evidence 2: A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash..
    - Evidence 3: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
    - Evidence 2: Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs..
    - Evidence 3: The Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse..
    - Evidence 4: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
    - Evidence 5: Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Despite more than $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005, the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys.
    - Evidence 2: Despite over $7 billion spent annually towards arresting[REF] and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005 (FBI Uniform Crime Reports), the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys..
    - Evidence 3: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 4: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Take California for example: first in the nation to legalize the medical use of the drug in 1996, the state would go on to legalize recreational use in 2016. But in just the past year, the state reported several massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza – just over the last three or four months..

We should legalize cannabis,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: In 2001, the New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group stated that decriminalizing cannabis will result in greater availability of resources to respond to more serious crimes without any increased risks to public safety..
    - Evidence 3: Psychopharmacologist David Nutt argues, though he is against full declassification, that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco, which, if they were invented today would be illegal..
    - Evidence 4: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
    - Evidence 5: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
    - Evidence 3: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 3: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
    - Evidence 2: Nicholas Green, chairman of the Bar Council, made comments in a report in the profession's magazine, in which he said that drug-related crime costs the UK economy about Â£13bn a year and that there was growing evidence that decriminalisation could free up police resources, reduce crime and recidivism and improve public health..
    - Evidence 3: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
    - Evidence 4: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
    - Evidence 5: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..

We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
    - Evidence 2: One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana. The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia..
    - Evidence 3: Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes..
    - Evidence 4: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Additionally it is argued that the legalisation of prostitution would result in an increase in human trafficking and crime..
    - Evidence 2: Bob Herbert also stated that many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps: Despite the fiction that they are independent contractors,most so-called legal prostitutes have pimps - the state-sanctioned pimps who run the brothels and, in many cases, a second pimp who controls all other aspects of their lives (and takes the bulk of their legal earnings)..
    - Evidence 3: The United Nations stated in 2009 that sex trafficking is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking and estimates that about 79% of human trafficking reported is for prostitution.
    - Evidence 4: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
    - Evidence 5: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
    - Evidence 2: Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men..
    - Evidence 3: Columnist Bob Herbert wrote A grotesque exercise in the dehumanization of women is carried out routinely at Sheri's Ranch, a legal brothel about an hour's ride outside of Vegas. There the women have to respond like Pavlov's dog to an electronic bell that might ring at any hour of the day or night. At the sound of the bell, the prostitutes have five minutes to get to an assembly area where they line up, virtually naked, and submit to a humiliating inspection by any prospective customer who has happened to drop by.
    - Evidence 4: The Aboriginal Women's Action Network, an abolitionist organization in Canada, has specifically noted that because the prostitution of Aboriginal women results from and reinforces such extreme hatred of Aboriginal women, no regime of legalisation (which will expand the industry and entrap more women) can be safer for Aboriginal women. Prostitution can only further harm Aboriginal women..
    - Evidence 5: Melissa Farley argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes, saying, Nevada's rape rate is higher than the U.S. average and way higher than the rape rate in California, New York and New Jersey. Why is this? Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them, are disrespected by men, and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women..
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..

We should legalize prostitution,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
    - Evidence 2: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The report also addressed the suggestion of civil remedy, stating that the person exploited in prostitution may normally be considered the injured party, implying a civil right to damages under the law..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 3: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
    - Evidence 4: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
    - Evidence 5: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent..
    - Evidence 2: The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person. Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry..
    - Evidence 3: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
    - Evidence 4: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear..
    - Evidence 2: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 3: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 4: Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution in toto, there is some evidence that regulation of China's recreational venues has helped to create a legitimate female service worker with the right to refuse to engage in practices repugnant to the valid labour contract, as well as the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace..
    - Evidence 5: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Many people who support legal prostitution argue that prostitution is a consensual sex act between adults and a victimless crime, thus the government should not prohibit this practice..
    - Evidence 2: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
    - Evidence 3: For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word prostitution to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term criminal sexual acts..
    - Evidence 4: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 5: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..

We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Instead of policy expanding women's opportunities for gainful employment policy, from 1979 onward the one-child policy has added upon the son preference causing the largest number of missing women in any country..
    - Evidence 2: Some bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society . Charles Lockwood of Yale says, a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars..
    - Evidence 3: When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences..
    - Evidence 4: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
    - Evidence 5: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
    - Evidence 2: Gender-biased sex selection (GBSS) is a result and an expression of cultural preference for sons..
    - Evidence 3: Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son, while a deeply rooted son preference makes many families want a son..
    - Evidence 4: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
    - Evidence 5: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 3: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
    - Evidence 4: Under the tradition of son preference and the one-child policy, missing females in China are formed through sex-selective abortion, discrimination in care for females, and non-registration of girls at birth..
    - Evidence 5: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
","Evidence 1: In countries where sex selection is not enforced, the birth rate is higher than in countries where it is, suggesting that sex-selective abortion may lead to a higher birth rate.
  Evidence 2: In countries where sex selection is implemented, the sex ratio at birth is distorted in favor of sons, suggesting that sex-selective abortion may lead to a higher number of male births.
  Evidence 3: In countries where sex-selective abortions are not enforced, the proportion of male births is higher than in countries where it is, suggesting that sex-selective abortion leads to a higher percentage of male births.
  Evidence 4: In countries where sex selection is not enforced, the male birth ratio is higher than in countries where it is, suggesting that sex-selective abortion leads to a higher percentage of male births.
  Evidence 5: In countries where sex selection is not implemented, the male birth ratio is higher than in countries where it is, suggesting that sex-selective abortion leads to a higher proportion of male births."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Most families opt for unisex stuffs for babies before they are born. From clothes to toys, the color of the crib to the various necessities and accessories, everything is gender neutral in most cases. With gender selection or knowing baby’s gender can help every family to buy gender specific items. This not only does away with the ambiguity but actually helps the baby to get the best stuff as well. There is also a financial aspect as after the birthing of a baby, the parents always spend money on items that are for a boy or girl respectively. Knowing the gender or choosing gender allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The economic advantage is not oft talked about but it is significant..
    - Evidence 3: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
    - Evidence 4: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 4: There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire..
    - Evidence 5: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 3: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Evidence 1: If one wishes to have a baby of a certain gender, they can always choose an embryo of that sex when they go for reproductive medicine. 
  Evidence 2: If one desires a baby of a particular gender, they can always pick a healthy embryo of that gender when they opt for reproductive medicine. 
  Evidence 3: If one hopes for a baby of a certain gender, they can always select an embryo of that gender when they opt for reproductive medicine. 
  Evidence 4: If one is looking to have a baby of a specific gender, they can always choose an embryo of that gender when they opt for reproductive medicine.

We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In common usage, the phrase 'flag burning' refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest..
    - Evidence 2: In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7-2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:  In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth..
    - Evidence 3: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 5: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Judge White did not go so far as to say that flag-burning is not constitutionally protected; rather, he wrote that without the benefit of the majority's thinking if it were to find flag burning protected by the First Amendment, I would sustain such a conviction..
    - Evidence 2: In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 3: the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
    - Evidence 4: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
","The flag burning case was an example of the Supreme Court's opinion that First Amendment protection includes even offensive speech. The majority opinion held that flag desecration is symbolic speech, which is a form of expression protected by the First Amendment. The minority opinion argued that flag burning is not constitutionally protected and should be prohibited. The minority argued that flag burning is not a form of protected speech, but rather a form of expression that should be prohibited. The majority opinion held that flag burning is constitutionally protected speech, while the minority argued that it is not. The minority opinion argued that flag burning is not constitutionally protected, while the majority opinion argued that it is. The minority opinion argued that flag burning should be prohibited, while the majority opinion argued that it should be constitutionally protected."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Warren was of the opinion that laws against flag-burning are constitutional.
    - Evidence 2: Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country's own national flag and flags of other countries..
    - Evidence 3: By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag..
    - Evidence 4: For example, Hugo Black did not believe that flag burning was speech; in Street v. New York (1969), he wrote: It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Rehnquist argued that flag burning is no essential part of any exposition of ideas but rather the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 4: According to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration..
    - Evidence 5: nan.

We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls and makes our communities safer and healthier. It is a human right and it is good for the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations. Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy. In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy..
    - Evidence 3: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
    - Evidence 4: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
    - Evidence 5: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: As a health professional and a researcher, Mar Nagel found that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions. They have better social and communication skills than men, possess strong memory, are sophisticated and show precision and fast reaction and response time..
    - Evidence 3: Equal or Better Performance at Military Service Academies: Women have been admitted to the Army, Navy and Air Force Academies since 1978. In this year’s first graduating classes with women, the women’s performance has equaled and often surpassed that of their male counterparts..
    - Evidence 4: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
    - Evidence 5: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address..
    - Evidence 2: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 4: The more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed..
    - Evidence 5: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Nindl, et al. (p. 51, 2016), training programs increased the number of pull-ups that women were capable of, demonstrating that they could overcome their naturally smaller muscle mass. Additionally, their research found that women performed better than men in ultra-endurance, or the ability to physical endure for a given extended period of time. These studies suggest that women excel in some abilities, and that while men are indeed stronger as a physical typicality, there are exceptions and other ways that women can compete..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
    - Evidence 3: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 4: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
    - Evidence 2: In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty..
    - Evidence 3: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 4: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
    - Evidence 5: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: As long as they qualify and meet the standards, women will now be able to contribute to our mission in ways they could not before. They'll be able to drive tanks, give orders, lead infantry soldiers into combat, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said at a news conference Thursday (Dec. 3)..
    - Evidence 2: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
    - Evidence 3: Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.

We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
    - Evidence 3: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
    - Evidence 4: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
    - Evidence 2: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
    - Evidence 3: While the majority of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves.  In addition, combat units engage in activities designed to suit men’s capabilities. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this..
    - Evidence 4: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
    - Evidence 5: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Having women serving in direct combat will hamper mission effectiveness by hurting unit morale and cohesion..
    - Evidence 2: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
    - Evidence 3: Inconvenient truth is that men and women have been each other’s most consistent distraction since the beginning of time. To pretend that we don’t know what will happen when men and women are thrown together for prolonged periods in emotionally intense situations defies common sense. Being overly academic and insufficiently adult about adult behavior isn’t just irresponsible but imperiling, and belies the deadly seriousness with which we should want combat units to perform..
    - Evidence 4: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
    - Evidence 5: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected..
    - Evidence 3: 1988 – The DoD convenes its Task Force on Women in the Military and adopts the “risk rule,” which excludes women from combat units or missions which risk exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture..
    - Evidence 4: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
    - Evidence 5: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
    - Evidence 2: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Evidence 1: The British Government said that women are not as strong as men, and that their presence in combat units can be a distraction and a risk.
  Evidence 2: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, they were not physically strong enough to sustain them.
  Evidence 3: The Army acknowledged that its female soldier capture policy was not working, and so it changed the rules to better protect them, while restricting their roles in tougher units.
  Evidence 4: The DoD concluded that the presence of women in combat roles was a distraction and risk.
  Evidence 5: The IDF said that fewer than 4% of women in its ranks had been captured, and they were likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations."
We should subsidize journalism,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Government intervention has the risk of inserting bias/harming objectivity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they provide a safe harbor for biased journalism..
    - Evidence 2: Media coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict by journalists in international news media has been said to be biased by both sides and independent observers. These perceptions of bias, possibly exacerbated by the hostile media effect, have generated more complaints of partisan reporting than any other news topic and have led to a proliferation of media watchdog groups..
    - Evidence 3: Pinkerton observes a tumultuous history involving allegations of anti-India bias in the BBC's reportage, particularly during the cold war, and concludes that the BBC's coverage of South Asian geopolitics and economics shows a pervasive and hostile anti-India bias due to the BBC's alleged imperialist and neo-colonialist stance..
    - Evidence 4: The Public Journalism Network explains that journalism and democracy work best when news, information and ideas flow freely; when news portrays the full range and variety of life and culture of all communities; when public deliberation is encouraged and amplified; and when news helps people function as political actors and not just as political consumers...
    - Evidence 5: Political endorsements create more opportunities to construe favoritism in reporting, and can create a perceived conflict of interest..
- claim_2: It is preferable to spend the money elsewhere.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Postal subsidies from our nation’s early founding (cited as a precedent by Downie/Schudson and McChesney/Nichols) are irrelevant. We had one communication medium then, newspapers.

    - Evidence 1: In Europe, the European Court of Human Rights stated in the 1996 case of Goodwin v. United Kingdom that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom .. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest..
    - Evidence 2: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..
    - Evidence 3: According to a Zogby International survey, 70% of Americans say journalism is important to maintaining community quality of life, and 67% say the traditional media are out of touch with what citizens want from their news..
    - Evidence 4: Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting..
    - Evidence 5: When news media lost a sizable percentage of their advertising revenues in the pandemic, state subsidies became more important than ever in securing the financial viability of media markets..
- claim_2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Further technological development within the world of the Internet points to a trend of increased usage of non-institutionalized, non-governmental, non-administrative and clearly transnational information during reporting and research work..
    - Evidence 2: Solutions journalism supporters believe that it provides an important feedback system that allows society to see credible possibilities and respond more successfully to emerging challenges..
    - Evidence 3: The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news..
    - Evidence 4: A study authorized by the Trilateral Commission in 1975 to examine the governability of American democracy found that the most notable new source of national power in 1970, as compared to 1950, was the national media, suggesting also that there was considerable evidence to suggest that the development of television journalism contributed to the undermining of governmental authority..
    - Evidence 5: MacLean argues that education in journalism helps empower members of the public to understand how media work..
- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The IFJ launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative in 2008, a global campaign to defend standards and to raise awareness of the importance of quality journalism..
    - Evidence 2: The IPD journalism program helps strengthen journalists' economic literacy and equips them to report and write about the major economic issues confronting developing economies..
    - Evidence 3: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Peace journalism, by presenting anomalous local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism, may help to expose these violent group's attempts to fix and naturalise meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence..

","The argument is that if we provide subsidies to journalism, the quality of journalism will improve. We can provide subsidies to journalism by providing grants to journalists to help them cover their costs, or by providing tax credits to media organizations to help them stay afloat. Additionally, governments can provide direct funding to media outlets to help them produce quality content."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
    - Evidence 2: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 3: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
    - Evidence 4: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
    - Evidence 2: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 3: Rockets and spaceflight instruments do not assemble themselves. They are designed and built by people, who get paid. They are fabricated from components which have to be manufactured and then purchased. The community engaged in the space industry includes specialist scientists and engineers, designers, graphic artists and IT professionals, as well as a vast support system: HR, catering, cleaning, etc..
    - Evidence 4: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
    - Evidence 5: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
    - Evidence 2: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 3: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
    - Evidence 4: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
    - Evidence 3: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
    - Evidence 4: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The evidence suggests that space exploration is not as cost-effective as it could be, and that its resources would be better invested elsewhere. Governments should prioritize spending on issues such as poverty, health and education, rather than investing in space travel."
We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,alpaca,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe..
    - Evidence 3: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
    - Evidence 4: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
    - Evidence 5: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars..
    - Evidence 2: Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence..
    - Evidence 3: An artist’s concept of New Horizons during the spacecraft’s planned encounter with Pluto and its moon Charon. The craft’s miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and space plasma experiments would characterize the global geology and geomorphology of Pluto and Charon, map their surface compositions and temperatures, and examine Pluto’s atmosphere in detail..
    - Evidence 4: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
    - Evidence 5: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more. We're constantly evolving and finding new ways to add value..
    - Evidence 2: Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA’s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations..
    - Evidence 3: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 4: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Every year, about a thousand technical innovations generated in the space program find their ways into our earthly technology where they lead to better kitchen appliances and farm equipment, better sewing machines and radios, better ships and airplanes, better weather forecasting and storm warning, better communications, better medical instruments, better utensils and tools for everyday life..
    - Evidence 2: Space Exploration for the Survival of the Human Race.
    - Evidence 3: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
    - Evidence 4: Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites – which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path – to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns..
    - Evidence 5: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration of our solar system and distant galaxies in the furthest reaches of the Universe is important to top-level science and the answers to many fundamental scientific questions including formation of the Universe, the origin of Earth, Evolution of life, and the Existence of life beyond the Earth. Space robotics plays a critical role in the current and future space exploration missions, and enables mission-defined machines that are capable of surviving in the space environment, and performing exploration, assembly, construction, maintenance, or servicing tasks..
    - Evidence 2: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
    - Evidence 3: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..
    - Evidence 4: space exploration, investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches of the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","- Evidence 1: Space exploration has been essential to our understanding of the universe and has already yielded valuable data.

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying supporters argue that the recent trends towards the use of the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland and press stories regarding botched suicides and do-it-yourself advice would be stopped because individuals would know that when and if they wished to finally request an assisted death in the UK, it would be available as arranged..
    - Evidence 3: A qualitative study using narrative interviews was conducted throughout the UK. Results shows that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most people. Those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a right. Some had multiple reasons, including pain and anticipated pain, fear of indignity, loss of control and cognitive impairment. Those who did not want to be a burden also had other reasons for wanting euthanasia. Suicide was contemplated by a few, who would have preferred a change in the law to allow them to end their lives with medical help and in the company of family or friends..
    - Evidence 4: Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment..
    - Evidence 5: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient..
    - Evidence 2: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 3: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..

    - Evidence 3: The use of Advanced Decisions can help significantly but they also believe that if a right to an Assisted Death is available then the very knowledge of this fact can alleviate many of the worries an individual might have..
    - Evidence 4: Dignity in Dying argue that if a person does not wish to take advantage of a change in the law which would allow for an assisted death then that is down to personal choice..
    - Evidence 5: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..

    - Evidence 3: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 4: Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned..
    - Evidence 5: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..

Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 3: “Differentiation is what homeschooling is all about,” Sherry Bushnell told me. She and herhusband founded the National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, an internationalorganization that supports parents who educate special-needs children at home. They homeschool their sonJordan, a 13-year-old boy with Down's syndrome, along with his nine siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
    - Evidence 5: The efficiency of homeschooling – and the fact that you don’t have to follow the national curriculum or the typical timings of a school day – leaves you with time to spend broadening your child’s learning. You can make time for play, projects, real experiments, and the arts. Real-life skill building – including cooking, cleaning, volunteering, and learning to budget – could form a part of your school day. You could also choose to learn in different places, like museums, parks, and science centres..

    - Evidence 2: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 3: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.

Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Unschooling contrasts with other forms of home education in that the student's education is not directed by a teacher and curriculum..
    - Evidence 2: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 3: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 4: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although we acknowledged in the advantages section that homeschooled children do still develop socially, they naturally lose some interaction by spending more time at home. They may be out of touch with their peers, have fewer friends, and have less experience interacting with people from different backgrounds. Their view of the world could be very narrow and biased. In the worst cases, they could be brought up to be intolerant and misinformed, with little knowledge of general societal values. This could disadvantage them in the future..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..

    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..

    - Evidence 1: Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse..
    - Evidence 2: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 3: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 4: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 2: As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant..
    - Evidence 3: In the same manner, children receiving vaccines against pneumococcus reduces pneumococcal disease incidence among younger, unvaccinated siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries..
    - Evidence 5: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization (WHO): 'After observation of study populations for periods of up to 20 years in Japan and 10 years in the United States, more than 90% of immunocompetent persons who were vaccinated as children were still protected from varicella.'.
    - Evidence 2: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
    - Evidence 3: Vaccination campaigns helped eradicate smallpox, which once killed as many as one in seven children in Europe, and have nearly eradicated polio..
    - Evidence 4: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..
    - Evidence 5: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..
","Claim 1: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. 
Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, as many as 90% of immunocompetent individuals who were vaccinated as children were still protected from varicella.
Evidence 2: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases, such as measles, which increased by thirty percent in 2019.
Evidence 3: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease, such as measles, which increased by thirty percent in 2019."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An Online Harms White Paper (April 2019) argued that existing regulatory and voluntary initiatives had 'not gone far or fast enough” to keep users safe.'.
    - Evidence 2: Another California legislation, Senate Bill No. 1001, was signed into law last September and will go into effect in July. It purports to address the role of bots in fake news and advertising. But the law’s definition of “bot” is too broad, and the method it uses is a poor match for the goal it seeks to accomplish..
    - Evidence 3: Legislation has a noticeable gap failing to hold the platform companies accountable for their management in data privacy, and calls to arms by legislators typically come after an identified breach yet quickly lose momentum..
    - Evidence 4: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
    - Evidence 5: Lack of enforcement of the European Union’s data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., has also cast a shadow over the new laws..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Government use of SMMS or 'Social media monitoring software can be used to geographically track us as we communicate. It can chart out our relationships, networks, and associations. It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.'.
    - Evidence 2: On October 18, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was scheduled to begin using personal information collected using social media platforms to screen immigrants arriving in the U.S. The department made this new measure known in a posting to the Federal Register in September 2017, noting that '...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results...' would be included in an applicant's immigration file. This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates..
    - Evidence 3: Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, and can easily lead to censorship..
    - Evidence 4: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..
    - Evidence 5: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The Open Rights Group and the Index on Censorship warned that the proposals could threaten freedom of expression..
    - Evidence 2: But for every voice pushing for tighter restrictions under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, there’s an equal level of pushback arguing that these regulations violate the First Amendment and protected free speech..
    - Evidence 3: Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, and can easily lead to censorship..
    - Evidence 4: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
    - Evidence 5: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
    - Evidence 2: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As an example, during the recent upsurge in violence in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in May, Palestinian voices were disproportionately undermined by social media company content moderation practices, and there were limited avenues for challenging take-down decisions..
    - Evidence 2: Herbert Lin - Senior Research Scholar, Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University, said:' Government regulation to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation is neither desirable nor feasible. It is not desirable because any process developed to address the problem cannot be made immune to political co-optation. '.
    - Evidence 3: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..
    - Evidence 4: Around the US 2016 election, Russian entities set up and promoted fake Pages on Facebook to influence public sentiment — essentially using social media as an information weapon..
    - Evidence 5: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
","claim_6: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  evidence_6: Example: In the U.S., during the recent upsurge in violence in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Palestinian voices were disproportionately silenced by social media company content moderation practices, and there were limited avenues for challenging take-down decisions."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On 8 February, the DCMS announced that the Bill would be strengthened so that all providers who published or placed pornographic content on their services would need to prevent children from accessing that content..
    - Evidence 2: Also in 2020, EPIC and coalition of child advocacy, consumer, and privacy groups filed a complaint urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and penalize TikTok for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act..
    - Evidence 3: Companies are obligated to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act if they know that children under age 13 use their platforms. The law, known as COPPA, gives parents control over what information online platforms can collect about their kids..
    - Evidence 4: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
    - Evidence 5: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: “Platforms should be transparent about their content moderation decisions, prevent dangerous disinformation from going viral and avoid unsafe products being offered on marketplaces,” said Margrethe Vestager, who has spearheaded much of the bloc’s work to regulate the tech industry as the executive vice president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union..
    - Evidence 2: The European Union reached a deal on Saturday on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation..
    - Evidence 3: A recent Gallup poll found that only 37 percent believe “news organizations generally get the facts straight.” This is down from about half of the country who felt that way in 1998..
    - Evidence 4: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
    - Evidence 5: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If we believe news headlines, social media is responsible for many of the major scourges of modern life. It is coarsening our political discourse, leading to polarization and division. It exposes vulnerable people to extremist ideology, driving them toward violence. Social media is addictive, can damage our body image and sense of self-worth..
    - Evidence 2: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 3: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
    - Evidence 4: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'This proportionate new framework will ensure we don’t put unnecessary burdens on small businesses but give large digital businesses robust rules of the road to follow so we can seize the brilliance of modern technology to improve our lives.'.
    - Evidence 5: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Along those lines, Senator Amy Klobuchar has proposed legislation to have the National Science Foundation identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material..
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
    - Evidence 3: Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'We will not allow child sexual abuse, terrorist material and other harmful content to fester on online platforms. Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.'.
    - Evidence 4: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 5: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Matthew Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, one of the companies that drove the National Socialists out, argued later that businesses lack the legitimacy to govern speech on their forums. He suggested that most people see government as the proper authority to suppress speech related to violence..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 3: Another rising concern, exacerbated by Cambridge Analytica’s breach of Facebook data, centers on how bad actors access private data from social media platforms and elsewhere and use it to manipulate opinions for the benefit of a few..
    - Evidence 4: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..
    - Evidence 5: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..

The USA is a good country to live in,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The USA is a good country to live in', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The US has unfair health and education policies.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: About a quarter of adults say they or family member in their household have not filled a prescription, cut pills in half, or skipped doses of medicine in the last year because of the cost, with larger shares of those in households with lower incomes, Black and Hispanic adults, and women reporting this..
    - Evidence 2: Among those under age 65, uninsured adults are much more likely to say affording health care costs is difficult (85%) compared to those with health insurance coverage (47%)..
    - Evidence 3: Additionally, at least six in ten Black adults (60%) and Hispanic adults (65%) report difficulty affording health care costs compared to about four in ten White adults (39%)..
    - Evidence 4: Adults in households with annual incomes under $40,000 are more than three times as likely as adults in households with incomes over $90,000 to say it is difficult to afford their health care costs (69% v. 21%)..
    - Evidence 5: In 2007, 8.1 million children under 18 years old were without health insurance. Children in poverty and Hispanic children were more likely to be uninsured..
- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Over the summer, 76% of Republicans (including independents who lean to the party) felt the U.S. had done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, compared with just 29% of those who do not identify with the Republican Party..
    - Evidence 2: Moreover, 77% of Americans said the country was now more divided than before the outbreak, as compared with a median of 47% in the 13 other nations surveyed..
    - Evidence 3: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
    - Evidence 4: According to Carothers and O’Donohue, a “powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion renders America’s divisions unusually encompassing and profound..
    - Evidence 5: In their study of polarization across nations, Thomas Carothers and Andrew O’Donohue argue that polarization runs particularly deep in the U.S. in part because American polarization is 'especially multifaceted.'.
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: I struggle so much with this insane work culture in America. We are so freaking proud of working ourselves to death..
    - Evidence 2: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
    - Evidence 3: In a recent opinion piece for The New York Times, Anne-Marie Slaughter laments the state of the current American workplace, which she considers toxic by nature..
    - Evidence 4: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
    - Evidence 5: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045). Simply living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, researchers suggest..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Americans with less than five-figure incomes pay an effective payroll tax rate of 14.1 percent, while those making seven-figure incomes or more pay just 1.9 percent..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers estimate, for example, that 80 percent of families saw the share of budgets dedicated to spending on needs such as housing and health care increase by more than 7 percentage points between 1984 and 2014, potentially crowding out spending on other categories like leisure, longer-term investments in education, and saving for retirement..
    - Evidence 3: Further, a 2019 Pew survey found that 35 percent of middle-income families frequently worry about paying their bills; similarly, 37 percent worry about the cost of health care for themselves and their families..
    - Evidence 4: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
    - Evidence 5: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The ownership of wealth among households in the U.S. became somewhat more concentrated since the 1980s. The top 10% of households controlled 68.2 percent of the total wealth in 1983 and 73.1% of the total wealth in 2007..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers recently tested 355,000 White and 77,000 Black Americans and discovered a strong link between a fear of diseases and implicit/explicit racial bias. The tests found that 'among white people who are highly averse to germs, images that evoke thoughts of infectious disease also increase bias against African Americans.'.
    - Evidence 3: From the U.S. Census Bureau, the official poverty rate in 2020 was 11.4 percent, up 1.0 percentage point from 10.5 percent in 2019..
    - Evidence 4: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
    - Evidence 5: The United States’ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019—the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany—according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The US has the highest rate of death by guns in the developed world, and more than double the gun ownership rates than Yemen, a country that has been embroiled in a civil war since 2014..
    - Evidence 2: More Americans have been killed by guns since 1968 than soldiers have died in all of America’s wars combined..
    - Evidence 3: An astounding 1.5 million Americans died by gunfire between 1986 and 2017..
    - Evidence 4: A country where, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 253 mass shootings in the country since the beginning of 2019. That’s more shootings than days. Two of those occurred over the weekend in less than 24 hours, first in El Paso, Texas followed by Dayton, Ohio, leaving 31 dead..
    - Evidence 5: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Since 1892, the United States has deported more immigrants (over 57 million) than any other nation..
    - Evidence 2: Nearly three in ten Asian Americans report experiencing racial slurs or jokes since the start of the pandemic, over 6,600 incidents of hate crime (including physical attacks on Asian elders) have been reported nationwide, and six women were murdered at three Asian-owned spas in Georgia in March 2021..
    - Evidence 3: There is an oversimplification of racism in America, because as sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva notes, there can be systemic racism without racists..
    - Evidence 4: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
    - Evidence 5: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..

The USA is a good country to live in,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The USA is a good country to live in', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: The US has a good economy/high standard of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Income in 2015 was $56,300 per capita, one of the highest in the developed world..
    - Evidence 2: In the United States, the average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is USD 51 147 a year, much more than the OECD average of USD 30 490 a year..
    - Evidence 3: In terms of employment, about 67% of people aged 15 to 64 in the United States have a paid job, slightly above the OECD employment average of 66%..
    - Evidence 4: Constituting less than 5 percent of the world's population, Americans generate and earn more than 20 percent of the world's total income. America is the world's largest national economy and leading global trader..
    - Evidence 5: According to Caleb Silver with Investopedia, America controls the top spot in the ranking of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or the sum value of goods and services in a country..
- claim_2: The US has a good health and education systems.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. outperforms peer nations in terms of preventive measures. In the U.S., more than two-thirds of adults 65 and older had a flu vaccine in 2016, considerably more than in the average OECD country..
    - Evidence 2: he U.S. also had one of the highest rates of women ages 50 to 69 being screened for breast cancer. The U.S. rate is considerably higher than the OECD average. In contrast, in Switzerland, France, and Germany, only half of women this age had been screened..
    - Evidence 3: The United States leads the world as a juggernaut of medical research and innovation. More Americans have received the Nobel Prize in medicine than Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia combined, which together have double the aggregate population of the US..
    - Evidence 4: Half of the top 10 diagnostic or therapeutic innovations in the past 50 years have come in whole or in part from the US, along with 75% of the top 30..
    - Evidence 5: The advanced medical milieu that Americans enjoy has led to the world’s best cancer survival rates, a life expectancy for those over 80 that is actually greater than anywhere else, and lower mortality rates for heart attacks and strokes than in comparable countries..
- claim_3: The US has a great environment/nature.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Famous conservationist and wilderness writer John Muir called Yosemite nature’s temple..
    - Evidence 2: The estimated value of natural resources in the U. S. is $45 trillion, almost 90% of which are timber and coal. In fact, the U.S. is the leading producer of coal. As of 2020, it had the largest proven coal reserves in the world..
    - Evidence 3: A country as vast as the United States is bound to be home to some incredible works of art by Mother Nature. From sprawling canyons and towering sand dunes to huge glaciers and picturesque valleys, these are the most incredible natural wonders found in the US..
    - Evidence 4: The landscape varies across the large country from tropical beaches in Florida to peaks in the Rocky Mountains, from rolling prairie lands and barren deserts in the West to dense wilderness areas in the Northeast and Northwest. Interspersed throughout are the Great Lakes, the Grand Canyon, the majestic Yosemite Valley, and the mighty Mississippi River..
    - Evidence 5: The wildlife is as diverse as the landscape. Mammals such as bison once roamed freely across the plains, but now live only in preserves. Black bears, grizzlies, and polar bears are the largest carnivores. There are over 20,000 flower species and most came from Europe. There are more than 400 areas which are protected and maintained by the National Park Service, and many other parks in each state..
- claim_4: The US has freedoms/ democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Human Rights: The Essential Reference, 'the American Declaration of Independence was the first civic document that met a modern definition of human rights.'.
    - Evidence 2: Our right to gather in peaceful public protest – in marches, rallies and other assemblies – is another core freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment. As a First Amendment scholar says in this overview, 'First Amendment freedoms ring hollow if government officials can repress expression that they fear will create a disturbance or offend. Unless there is real danger of imminent harm, assembly rights must be respected.'.
    - Evidence 3: On September 11, 2001, the OAS adopted the Inter-American Democratic Charter designed to strengthen and preserve representative democracy in the hemisphere. Article 1 states: “The peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it.” It also states that: 'Democracy is essential for the social, political, and economic development of the peoples of the Americas.'.
    - Evidence 4: A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular, and what no just government should refuse.  - Thomas Jefferson, December 20, 1787.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: The US has great people/culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The USA's cultural influence extends across the world, for example over two billion people speak some English in the world today with the majority speaking an Americanised version of the language..
    - Evidence 2: The USA also has a social and cultural impact on immediate neighbours such as Mexico and Canada and on North/Central America as a whole..
    - Evidence 3: Nearly every region of the world has influenced American culture, most notably the English who colonized the country beginning in the early 1600s, according to the Library of Congress(opens in new tab). U.S. culture has also been shaped by the cultures of Indigenous Americans, Latin Americans, Africans and Asians..
    - Evidence 4: Because of this, the United States is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world, according to The London School(opens in new tab)..
    - Evidence 5: The United States is sometimes described as a 'melting pot', according to Golden Beacon USA(opens in new tab), in which different cultures have contributed their own distinct 'flavors' to American culture. Just as cultures from around the world have influenced American culture, today American culture influences the world..
- claim_6: The US is a powerful country.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The US has been ranked the world's most powerful country for the seventh time, according to the latest rankings by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and US News & World Report..
    - Evidence 2: 'There's no country that is viewed more of a leader than the United States,' said David Reibstein, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School who conducted the research..
    - Evidence 3: The United States of America is a North American nation that is the world’s most dominant economic and military power. Likewise, its cultural imprint spans the world, led in large part by its popular culture expressed in music, movies and television..
    - Evidence 4: With so many advantages and strengths, the U.S. towers over its rivals worldwide, despite misperceptions of the threats from China and Russia, says a Tufts political scientist..
    - Evidence 5: But Michael Beckley, an associate professor of political science at Tufts, doesn’t buy that. To him, this is the era of the U.S. as sole superpower, and the country’s domination of the global order should continue for decades, at least..
- claim_7: The US offers great opportunities for individuals.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: The Department of Labor reported Friday that there are some 8.7 million potential workers who have been looking for jobs and are counted among the unemployed. At the same time, job placement site Indeed estimates there are about 9.8 million job vacancies as of July 16, or just a few days after the government’s sample period for the monthly numbers..
    - Evidence 2: Job growth has been surging in recent months, with July’s number, reported Friday, showing an addition of 943,000, the biggest spike since August 2020. That came on top of respective gains of 938,000 and 614,000 in the previous two months, for an impressive three-month average of 832,000..
    - Evidence 3: In terms of jobs in America, almost all of the biggest companies in the world have offices in the USA. You will have career opportunities in America you could not get anywhere else in the world. Just one internship for a big name could change your career..

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
    - Evidence 2: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 3: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of clerical celibacy answer that God only calls men to the priesthood if they are capable. Those who are not called to the priesthood should seek other paths in life since they will be able to serve God better there..
    - Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 3: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption..
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of celibacy claim that Roman Catholic priests suffering sexual temptations are not likely to turn immediately to a teenage boy simply because Church discipline does not permit clergy to marry..
    - Evidence 5: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 3: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
    - Evidence 3: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
    - Evidence 2: Among the early Church statements on the topic of sexual continence and celibacy are the Directa and Cum in unum decretals of Pope Siricius (c. 385), which asserted that clerical sexual abstinence was an apostolic practice that must be followed by ministers of the church.
    - Evidence 3: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Aware of discussions on the continued mandatory priestly celibacy, most prominently by the Cardinal Archbishop Emmanuel C√©lestin Suhard of Paris, Spiazzi argued in Monitor Ecclesiasticus, that historical evidence for mandatory priestly celibacy was extremely shaky..
    - Evidence 2: The forerunner of the CƒåSH was the Jednota (Union of the Catholic Czechoslovak Clergy), which was founded in 1890 to promote modernist reforms in the Roman Catholic Church, such as use of the vernacular in the liturgy and the adoption of voluntary rather than compulsory clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 3: In a radio interview given on March 10, 2009, Egan stated that clerical celibacy in the Latin Rite could be open to discussion [REF]..
    - Evidence 4: Priestly celibacy is a practice rather than required dogma, and many at the time had expected that it might be relaxed together with other practices..
    - Evidence 5: Lakeland believes that Clerical celibacy should become optional and that change is inevitable..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent..
    - Evidence 2: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
    - Evidence 3: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Protestant apologists further argue that clerical celibacy violates the Biblical teaching in the First Epistle to Timothy:. The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
    - Evidence 3: Men are driven by testosterone to want sex, says John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University. Women are driven to a lesser degree by a mixture of testosterone and oestrogen, he explains. ’I'd regard celibacy as a totally abnormal state.’ Around 80-90% of men masturbate and it's likely that priests do too, he says. There is data to suggest that men who ejaculate more are less prone to prostate cancer, he says. You could argue that it's not so healthy to be celibate..
    - Evidence 4: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
    - Evidence 2: Ignoring his vow of celibacy, Urbain Grandier is known to have had sexual relationships with a number of women and to have acquired a reputation as a philanderer..
    - Evidence 3: Christoph Sch√∂nborn and Hans K√ºng have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church..
    - Evidence 4: In the wake of the clergy sexual abuse scandals, some critics have charged that priestly celibacy was a contributing factor.
    - Evidence 5: In 1395 there was a transvestite homosexual prostitute arrested in London with some records surviving, and the Twelve Conclusions of the Lollards included the denunciation of priestly celibacy as a cause of sodomy..
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
    - Evidence 2: In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy..

We should abandon marriage,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: One  of  the  factors  that  influence  adolescent  psychological  well-being  is  the role  of  family and  parents.  In  general,  parental  marriage  contributes  to  the  well-being  of  children  (Ribar, 2015) because  of  the financial  support between  husband and  wife, social  interaction between family members, and  stability  of  the relationship  between  parents who  are  bound  in marriage commitments.  Shek  et  al.  (2014)  found  that  parental  marital  conditions,  family  functioning, relationships  between  children  and  parents,  and  communication  patterns  affect  the  level  of psychological well-being  of  adolescents..
    - Evidence 2: Children raised in intact married families tend to earn higher grades than those in non-intact families.1) For example, kindergarten children from married families have higher reading scores than those from cohabiting families.2) Parents in always-intact married families are also more likely to help their children do their homework than are parents in stepfamilies or single-parent families,3) and fathers in always-intact married families are more involved in their children’s homework than are stepfathers.4) Compared with children in stable married families, students experiencing parental divorce have lower academic expectations and test scores.5).
    - Evidence 3: Plenty of research indicates that healthy marriage positively impacts children and society. And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, it’s possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages..
    - Evidence 4: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 5: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization..
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church..
    - Evidence 3: Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually..
    - Evidence 4: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 5: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Even middle-aged people, who generally tend to be unhappier than people in other stages of life, according to Science Daily, were able to enjoy an elevated level of happiness if they were married. Marriage may help ease the causes of a mid-life dip in life satisfaction and the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived, Helliwell explained..
    - Evidence 2: It’s not marriage that makes you happy, it’s happy marriage that makes you happy, Gilbert said. Married people are happier than unmarried ones, perhaps because the single best predictor of human happiness is the quality of social relationships. Marriage seems to buy you a decade or more of happiness, Gilbert said..
    - Evidence 3: Other recent research, however, has challenged this pessimistic view. Data from a large British panel survey show that marriage increased long-run happiness, suggesting that selection isn’t the whole story. Perhaps marriage doesn’t make Germans happy, but it does seem to make the English happy. Likewise, a paper using panel data from Taiwan has found somewhat more durable positive effects of marriage (though this there was a lot of variety in happiness trajectories, and Christians might get more happiness from marriage than other people)..
    - Evidence 4: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 5: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly..
    - Evidence 2: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult.
    - Evidence 3: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 4: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
    - Evidence 5: Each decision you as a couple can successfully make together brings you closer to each other..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage..
    - Evidence 2: One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill..
    - Evidence 3: There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married..
    - Evidence 4: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 5: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..

We should abandon marriage,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Roughly one in three girls in Zimbabwe is married by her eighteenth birthday. Discriminatory social norms that link a girl’s perceived “purity” to her family’s honor are among the factors that push girls into marriage. According to Human Rights Watch, young women and girls who become pregnant, stay out late, are seen in the company of suspected boyfriends, or are otherwise thought to be sexually active can be forced into marriage in order to preserve their familial honor..
    - Evidence 2: Paul Dolan claims that women might be happier if they stay single..
    - Evidence 3: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
    - Evidence 4: Unmarried women tend to be happier, healthier, and live longer didn't come as a surprise..
    - Evidence 5: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Alison, for instance, found that her husband would go out with his friends at the weekend while she stayed at home, preparing lessons and doing the housework. Then there are factors that have the capacity to bring everything to a head. Money is one. “He’d say, ‘Well, you chose to have a low-paid job,’” Alison says. By then they’d had a (planned and wanted) baby, and children are another acknowledged marriage stressor. They bring high strain (in terms of finances, fatigue and housework) and often highlight different standards of care. “It wasn’t an easy time,” Alison says. “It reinforced just how different we were. Before, when we argued, I just thought, ‘Well, we’ll make up a few hours later.’ But when you’ve got a child, you don’t want to be falling out all the time..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 3: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
    - Evidence 4: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 3: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
    - Evidence 4: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 5: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","Evidence 1: Monogamy is a dominant approach to relationships since it provides stability, fidelity, and trust. According to research, monogamous couples have more satisfying relationships and higher levels of commitment than those in open relationships. Monogamy offers a deeper level of intimacy and connection, which research shows can bring greater stability and trust to a relationship. Additionally, since monogamy is exclusive, it can prevent the potential for jealousy and competition. According to research, monogamy can lead to greater stability because it reduces the potential for jealousy and competition among partners. 
 
  Evidence 2: Monogamy is associated with higher levels of trust and stability in relationships because it allows for greater investment from both partners. Monogamy also leads to higher levels of commitment, since it reduces the potential for other partners.
 
  Evidence 3: Monogamy has been linked to greater stability in relationships, leading to greater satisfaction. According to research, monogamous couples have greater stability and trust, leading to greater satisfaction. This is likely due to the fact that monogamy reduces the potential for other partners and the potential for jealousy. 
 
  Evidence 4: Monogamy is linked to greater stability and satisfaction in relationships. Monogamy can foster better communication, greater intimacy, and greater trust. Open relationships, on the other hand, are associated with higher levels of jealousy.
 
  Evidence 1: Monogamy can lead to greater stability and trust.
 
 
  Evidence 2: In monogamy can lead to greater trust and stability. 
 
 
  Evidence 3: Monogamy is associated with greater stability and trust.

We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
    - Evidence 3: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to the long study and governments statistics gathered children are at higher risk if they “are perceived as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, wearing glasses or different clothing, being new to a school, or being unable to afford what kids consider 'cool.'.
    - Evidence 2: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 3: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
    - Evidence 4: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: B.R. international Public School shows that alongside featuring unity, uniforms likewise promote equality. Envision the circumstance without school uniforms. Students would show up in garments of their decision. Regardless of the amount we attempt, this will ingrain inequality- kids from rich foundations would wear their marked garments and adornments, while other students would build up a feeling of inadequacy..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 3: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
    - Evidence 4: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result..
    - Evidence 3: One study showed that 70% of principals believed that mandated school uniforms reduced disciplinary problems at their schools..
    - Evidence 4: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
    - Evidence 5: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
    - Evidence 3: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","School uniforms are a necessary part of learning and fostering a sense of equality and pride in the classroom. Uniforms not only create a sense of equality, but they can also help to save costs for parents, teachers, and schools. Uniforms create a sense of unity and equality, while helping to prevent bullying. Furthermore, uniforms can help to save money by encouraging parents to purchase clothing in bulk, rather than buying individual items."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The people who make up the rules for uniform requirement have false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same. That sounds more like a post-apocalyptic society in which we are all forced to think the same and have no choices in our lives from the day we are born, similar to novels such as Anthem and Fahrenheit 451..
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
    - Evidence 3: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'.
    - Evidence 2: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 3: According to Dr. Alan Hilfer, child psychologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, this may lead to situations in which teenage students start resenting uniforms, undermining the whole purpose of the measure..
    - Evidence 4: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 5: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The article called ‘ School Uniforms,’ stated 'Many parents may have to make financial sacrifices or rely on financial aid to pay the tuition at a private school. In such cases, expensive uniforms can be viewed as a financial burden that disproportionately affects students from low-income households. Some vendors have gained reputations for filling orders slowly and providing poor customer service while charging exorbitant prices.'.
    - Evidence 2: In a study of consumer costs of uniforms and whether money is actually saved, researchers found that uniforms do not replace kid's clothing, and parents actually ended up spending more money on clothes when uniforms are required..
    - Evidence 3: 95 percent of parents think school uniforms cost too much. About 16 percent said they’ve had to cut back on food and other essentials to pay for uniforms, and 13 percent said its pushed them into debt..
    - Evidence 4: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, many types of clothes popular among female students (especially during hot weather) are considered to be “sexually suggestive” (“School dress codes,” 2017, para. 7). According to the proponents of such rules for teenage girls, short skirts and similar clothes contribute to sexual crime in schools (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 2: Dr Johanna Reidy from Otago’s Department of Public Health says girls are forced to wear uniforms that stop them from being active during breaks or cycling to school..
    - Evidence 3: A researcher from the University of Otago says a radical redesign of uniforms is needed.  Students are often made to wear school uniforms that leave them too hot in summer, too cold in winter and are physically restrictive for girls..
    - Evidence 4: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
    - Evidence 5: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: This idea is supported by testimony from a 17-year-old student forced to wear uniforms. Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
    - Evidence 2: According to Grace Chen of the Public School Review, forced conformity may leave students ill prepared to enter the adult world where appearance matters even if uniforms are not required..
    - Evidence 3: 'School uniforms only reinforce the notion that authority and obedience matter most, which does not factor into dressing appropriately for a job in an adult career field' contends Scott Key of Fresno State University..
    - Evidence 4: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
    - Evidence 5: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..

We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
    - Evidence 2: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that he is against the death penalty, whether it is Saddam Hussein or anybody else..
    - Evidence 2: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as deliberate and systematic .. extrajudicial killings, and has condemned them as crimes against humanity..
    - Evidence 3: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bolte was a proponent of using capital punishment as a deterrent against violent crime..
    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
    - Evidence 3: Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals..
    - Evidence 4: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 5: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","Evidence supporting the claim: 
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty has been used as a form of punishment for centuries, most notably in the Code of Hammurabi, which dates back to 1750 BCE.
    - Evidence 2: The US Supreme Court has ruled that the death penalty is constitutional.
    - Evidence 3: The majority of US states have capital punishment statutes.
    - Evidence 4: The US Congress has passed several laws authorizing the death penalty.
 
  Arguments against the claim:
 
  Arguments against the claim: 
    - Arguments 1: The death penalty is an expensive form of punishment that costs more than life incarceration.
    - Arguments 2: The death penalty can lead to wrongful executions and thus violates the Eighth Amendmentâs ban on cruel and unusual punishments.
    - Arguments 3: Capital punishment can lead to extended delays before the convict is put to death and thus does not bring closure for victimsâ families.
    - Arguments 4: There is no conclusive evidence that the death penalty deters crime more effectively than life imprisonment."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Amnesty International, the death penalty is the ultimate, irreversible denial of human rights..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
    - Evidence 3: In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of people with mental retardation in Atkins v. Virginia, ruling that the practice constitutes cruel and unusual punishment..
    - Evidence 4: Execution is the ultimate, irrevocable punishment: the risk of executing an innocent person can never be eliminated. And such mistakes cannot be unmade. Since 1976, 143 US death row prisoners have been exonerated completely for their crimes..
    - Evidence 5: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In one occasion, Persian daily Neshat published an article which called for abolishing the death penalty, claiming that the capital punishment is no cure for maladies afflicting modern society..
    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
    - Evidence 3: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 2: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
    - Evidence 3: Nick Petersen, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Miami, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: Social science research does not support the contention that the death penalty deters crime. In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that “available studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.” A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion. Citing a number of problems with deterrence research, the council reported that “claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgments about capital punishment..
    - Evidence 4: John J. Donohue III, JD, PhD, Professor of Law at Stanford University, stated the following in his Aug. 8, 2015 article There’s No Evidence That Death Penalty Is a Deterrent against Crime, available at theconversation.com: There is not the slightest credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the rate of homicide. Whether one compares the similar movements of homicide in Canada and the US when only the latter restored the death penalty, or in American states that have abolished it versus those that retain it, or in Hong Kong and Singapore (the first abolishing the death penalty in the mid-1990s and the second greatly increasing its usage at the same), there is no detectable effect of capital punishment on crime. The best econometric studies reach the same conclusion… Last year roughly 14,000 murders were committed but only 35 executions took place. Since murderers typically expose themselves to far greater immediate risks, the likelihood is incredibly remote that some small chance of execution many years after committing a crime will influence the behaviour of a sociopathic deviant who would otherwise be willing to kill if his only penalty were life imprisonment. Any criminal who actually thought he would be caught would find the prospect of life without parole to be a monumental penalty. Any criminal who didn’t think he would be caught would be untroubled by any sanction..
    - Evidence 5: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..

We should abolish intellectual property rights,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish intellectual property rights', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Intellectual property rights incentivize creativity/innovation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By codifying intellectual property for plant breeders, UPOV aims to encourage the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society..
    - Evidence 2: Some copyright scholars believe that, regardless of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created..
    - Evidence 3: The basic public policy rationale for the protection of intellectual property is that IP laws facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovation into the public domain for the common good, by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights to exploit their works and invention for a limited period..
    - Evidence 4: Relying on the concept of the author, copyright is based on the assumption that without an intellectual property rights regime, authors would have no incentive to further create, and that artists cannot produce new works without an economic incentive..
    - Evidence 5: Examples of such theories include incentives theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivising the creation of new creative works..
- claim_2: Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) states that effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth across all industries and globally..
    - Evidence 2: According to the review intellectual property (IP) policy is an increasingly important tool for stimulating economic growth..
    - Evidence 3: Many economists believe that, in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced, because there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organisations to produce them.
    - Evidence 4: In relation to computer software, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) claimed in its 2011 piracy study: Public opinion continues to support intellectual property (IP) rights: Seven PC users in 10 support paying innovators to promote more technological advances...
    - Evidence 5: A joint research project of the WIPO and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth..
- claim_3: Intellectual property rights protect against stealing.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Annexed to this is the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) which aims to 'reduce distortions .. in international trade .. promote effective and adequate protection of intellectual property rights .. '..
    - Evidence 2: Operation In Our Sites is an initiative led by the NIPRCC to detect and hinder intellectual property violations on the Internet..
    - Evidence 3: If we want to continue to lead the world in producing intellectual property, we need to protect Americans' rights in that property, stated Senator Leahy..
    - Evidence 4: Locke's argument for intellectual property is based upon the idea that laborers have the right to control that which they create..
    - Evidence 5: Proponents say that copyright better preserves intellectual property like movies, music and television shows..
- claim_4: People, or a business, own their innovations and should be able to be compensated for their endeavour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intellectual property rights (IPRs) - IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation)..
    - Evidence 2: By providing innovators with durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources, intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility..
    - Evidence 3: A great number of jobs and industries are dependent on intellectual property and many people could benefit from better control and enforcement of their IP rights..
    - Evidence 4: IP-intensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added (price minus material cost) per employee than non-IP-intensive industries.
    - Evidence 5: These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs..
","We should abolish intellectual property rights because they restrict creativity and innovation. 
 
  Evidence 1: Abolishing intellectual property rights would lead to a decrease in the production of creative works.
 
  Evidence 2: Support for strong intellectual property rights provides an incentive for investment in innovation and creativity.
 
  Evidence 3: Without intellectual property rights, inventors and authors will be less incentivized to innovate and create.
 
  Evidence 4: Copyright laws enhance the incentive for authors and inventors to innovate and create.
 
  Evidence 5: Strong intellectual property rights are necessary to protect authors' and inventors' rights and to incentivize investment in creativity."
We should abolish intellectual property rights,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish intellectual property rights', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Intellectual property prevents the continuous improvement of a service/product.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By 1852, many in the photographic community felt that Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property were hampering the development of photography in England and had called upon him to relinquish his patent..
    - Evidence 2: Murray Rothbard argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain..
    - Evidence 3: Stallman argues that the term intellectual property is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of copyright, patent, trademark, and other laws by lumping together areas of law that are more dissimilar than similar..
    - Evidence 4: Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman argues that, although the term intellectual property is in wide use, it should be rejected altogether, because it systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion..
    - Evidence 5: Some critics of intellectual property, such as those in the free culture movement, point at intellectual monopolies as harming health (in the case of pharmaceutical patents), preventing progress, and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses, and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents..
- claim_2: Intellectual property restricts access to important information/products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The duration increased from an average of 32.2 years to 95 (for copyrights owned by corporations) between 1974 and 2004, and it may yet be extended further, in violation of the constitutional requirement that the exclusive rights be for limited times.  The scope has increased from regulating only publishers to now regulating just about everyone..
    - Evidence 2: Lateef Mtima, director of the Institute for Intellectual Property and Social Justice at Howard University School of Law, expressed concern that users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable themselves, saying, Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the bill is that the conduct it would criminalize is so poorly defined..
    - Evidence 3: Professor Lessig analyzes the tension that exists between the concepts of piracy and property in the intellectual property realm in the context of what he calls the present depressingly compromised process of making law that has been captured in most nations by multinational corporations that are interested in the accumulation of capital and not the free exchange of ideas..
    - Evidence 4: Regarding the intellectual property rights of indigenous peoples, the General Assembly recognized ..the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples which derive from their political, economic and social structures and from their cultures, spiritual traditions, histories and philosophies..;.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Intellectual property rights are unfair.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The PHM views the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights(TRIPS) as iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries and poor patients..
    - Evidence 2: Edwin Hettinger argues that natural rights arguments for intellectual property are weak and the philosophical tradition justifying property can not guide us in thinking about intellectual property..
    - Evidence 3: Roderick T. Long argues that the concept of intellectual property is not libertarian. He holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Intellectual property rights harm creativity/innovation.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: An extended extract from the opinion is widely quoted: Overprotecting intellectual property is as harmful as underprotecting it..
    - Evidence 2: In economies that haave to rely on imitaion, clear IP laws are unlikely to stimulate innovation..
    - Evidence 3: Ultimately, Lessig calls for changes in US copyright law that balance the support of intellectual property with cultural freedom..
    - Evidence 4: In a free culture, innovators are able to create - and build upon past creations - without the worry of infringing upon intellectual property rights..
    - Evidence 5: Petra Moser has asserted that historical analysis suggests that intellectual property laws may harm innovation: Overall, the weight of the existing historical evidence suggests that patent policies, which grant strong intellectual property rights to early generations of inventors, may discourage innovation..
- claim_5: Intellectual property rights waste money.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Bhagwati asserts that intellectual property does not belong in the WTO, since protecting it is simply a matter of royalty collection [..] The matter was forced onto the WTO's agenda during the Uruguay Round by the pharmaceutical and software industries, even though this risked turning the WTO into a glorified collection agency..
    - Evidence 2: Boldrin and Levine argue that government does not ordinarily enforce monopolies for producers of other goods. This is because it is widely recognized that monopoly creates many social costs. Intellectual monopoly is no different in this respect..
    - Evidence 3: For getting the protection for the first time, it could be bit expensive particularly if the product is complex and involves methods, designs, and processes..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: intellectual property rights are ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: There is an argument that copyright is invalid because, unlike physical property, intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state..
    - Evidence 2: Kinsella also claims that the only way that intellectual property rights can be implemented is by limiting others' physical property rights..
    - Evidence 3: Tucker did not believe in intellectual property rights in the form of patents, on the grounds that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot rightfully be held as property..
    - Evidence 4: The Electronic Frontier Foundation has pointed out that criminal law is poorly suited for regulation of intellectual property law and that IPRED2 presents a risk to industry and innovation..

    - Evidence 1: Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws.  A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, a study was released that examined the effect of comprehensive background checks on the state. The study examined nearly two decades (1981-2000) of data and found that background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California..
    - Evidence 3: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
    - Evidence 4: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2010, the Court further strengthened Second Amendment protections in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 567 F.3d 856. The plaintiff in McDonald challenged the constitutionality of the Chicago handgun ban, which prohibited handgun possession by almost all private citizens. In a 5-4 decision, the Court, citing the intentions of the framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment, held that the Second Amendment applies to the states through the incorporation doctrine..
    - Evidence 2: In 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court struck down a New York law requiring parties interested in purchasing a handgun for the use of self-defense outside of the home to obtain a license because the law issued licenses on a “may-issue” rather than a “shall issue” basis. This “may issue” licensing method allowed state authorities to deny interested parties public use licenses for firearms if the interested party was unable to show “proper cause” as to why they have a heightened need for self-protection over the general population..
    - Evidence 3: In a 5-4 vote Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of individual Americans to keep and bear arms. The court said gun ownership is an individual right, not connected with military service, and that it can be regulated in some ways..
    - Evidence 4: The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision. 'Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,' he said..
    - Evidence 5: For today’s gun owners, the right to own guns nearly rivals other rights laid out in the U.S. Constitution in terms of its personal salience. About three-quarters of gun owners (74%) say this right is essential to their own sense of freedom..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment..
    - Evidence 3: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama’s: 'every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.'.
    - Evidence 2: Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the NRA, stated, 'The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.'.
    - Evidence 3: A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun..
    - Evidence 4: Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer..
    - Evidence 5: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
","claim_5: Gun ownership promotes personal safety. 
  Evidence 1: According to a 2013 Pew survey, the majority of gun owners indicated that they owned a gun for self-protection. 
  Evidence 2: In a 2013 Gallup survey, gun owners cited personal safety as the primary reason for owning a firearm. 
  Evidence 3: Approximately 64% of gun owners living in a home with someone else who owns a gun felt safer due to owning a firearm."
We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Banning guns would save lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 2015, assaults with a firearm were 6.8 times more common in states that had the most guns, compared to the leas..
    - Evidence 2: More than a dozen studies have revealed that if you had a gun at home, you were twice as likely to be killed as someone who didn’t..
    - Evidence 3: Research from the Harvard School of Public Health tells us that states with higher gun ownership levels have higher rates of homicide..
    - Evidence 4: Data even tells us that where gun shops or gun dealers open for business, killings go up..
    - Evidence 5: When Missouri repealed its permit law, gun-related killings increased by 25 percent..
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, 'The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation.'.
    - Evidence 2: A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand.”.
    - Evidence 3: An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, “gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns.”.
    - Evidence 4: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
    - Evidence 5: 'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add..
- claim_3: Guns can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, “with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft..
    - Evidence 2: A Secret Service analysis found that of 24 mass shootings in 2019 at least 10 (42%) involved illegally possessed guns..
    - Evidence 3: According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who “used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence” obtained the gun from a family member or friend..
    - Evidence 4: 'Guns do fall into the wrong hands,' Commissioner Ramsey said, adding that many guns used by criminals were originally purchased legally..
    - Evidence 5: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children’s behavior around guns, stated, “We put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves. Because children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot ‘gun-proof’ them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children.”.
    - Evidence 2: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2021, unintentional shooting deaths accounted for over 4% (2,007) of total gun related deaths (44,912) in the United States..
    - Evidence 4: A study from 2014 showed that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm..
    - Evidence 5: A 2001 study found that regardless of age, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns..

We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are warning signs that acute budget and service pressures can encourage a retreat to silos or ‘passing the buck’, particularly at the operational level..
    - Evidence 2: The UK’s largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has documented a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. In that decade this food bank network went from distributing just under 26,000 parcels a year to handing out more than 1.33 million of them..
    - Evidence 3: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
    - Evidence 4: “Taking care of ‘at risk’ children is a mandatory concern. However, youth centres and outreach services are considered unessential and have been cut to the bone. Yet these are services that help prevent children becoming ‘at risk’ in the first place,” said Gray..
    - Evidence 5: “For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
    - Evidence 3: For instance, interest rates on Greek debt fell following its first bailout. However, the gains were limited to the government having decreased interest rate expenses. Although the private sector was unable to benefit, the major beneficiaries of lower rates are large corporations. Consumers benefited only marginally from lower rates, but the lack of sustainable economic growth kept borrowing at depressed levels despite the lower rates..
    - Evidence 4: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
    - Evidence 5: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government should listen to the people being pushed into poverty by its policies. Universal credit is failing miserably, leaving families in debt, [in] rent arrears and at risk of becoming homeless. Three million children are growing up in poverty despite living in a working household..
    - Evidence 2: Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots – Denise Hunter, 57, at the West End food bank in Newcastle-on-Tyne.
    - Evidence 3: I got hungry because I was smelling the other food. I had to take my eyes away from it. The most unfair thing is the government knows families are going through hard times but they decide not to do anything about it – John Adebola-Samuel, 12, whose family couldn’t get school meals in Dumfries, Scotland, because of their immigration status.
    - Evidence 4: I was 18 [and homeless] and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work. I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing – Tayah, west London..
    - Evidence 5: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
    - Evidence 3: Because the evidence shows that austerity strangled the green shoots of economic recovery that were sprouting when the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition took office..
    - Evidence 4: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
    - Evidence 5: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers..
    - Evidence 2: Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%..
    - Evidence 3: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
    - Evidence 4: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
    - Evidence 5: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","Evidence 1: In the past decade, countries like Greece have been encouraged to adopt austerity measures in order to reduce their budget deficits. This has led to higher unemployment levels, particularly among women, as well as higher poverty and inequality levels. 
 
  Evidence 2: In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, austerity measures have been implemented in order to reduce budget deficits. In the UK, spending cuts and wage freezes have been implemented in order to reduce the number of people who are unemployed and on benefits, such as the number of unemployed individuals. These measures have been proven to be ineffective and have done more harm than good. Even though the UK has experienced a decrease in GDP.
 
  Evidence 3: In the wake of the 2008 crisis, the UK economy has been hit hard by the austerity measures. 
 
 
  Evidence 1: In the wake. 
 
  Evidence 1: In the UK defic.), including budget cuts. 
 
  Evidence 2: In the given budget, which has been proven to be effective.

We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 2: If budget deficits are not cut, it can lead to higher bond yields (e.g. in case of Greece, Spain and Ireland)..
    - Evidence 3: After 2009 recession, many European and US economies faced record levels of peace-time deficit. The UK budget deficit was over 10% of GDP, causing a rise in national debt..
    - Evidence 4: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
    - Evidence 5: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: If policymakers and the electorate show sufficient resolve, carrying through with austerity will eventually be rewarded by better financing conditions. Austerity pays off in the long run..
    - Evidence 4: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Astute monetary policy and falls in international commodity prices are given by a recent World Bank overview, as reasons for this relatively steady growth in the services and industrial sectors, enjoyed by Morocco and reflected in the country’s GDP..
    - Evidence 2: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 3: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
    - Evidence 4: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Almost a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis, national debt in advanced economies remains near its highest level since World War II, averaging 104 percent of GDP. In Japan, the ratio is 240 percent and in Greece almost 185 percent. In Italy and Portugal, debt exceeds 120 percent of GDP. Without measures either to cut spending or increase revenue, the situation will only get worse..
    - Evidence 2: The most commonly proposed austerity measures in the IMF loans include wage bill cuts and freezes (31 countries), increases to or the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) (14 countries), and general public expenditure cuts (55 countries)..
    - Evidence 3: David Cameron used his speech at the Scottish Conservative conference over the weekend to hit back. He said: 'Our opponents bleat on about austerity but I tell you – if we don’t get a grip of these debts, they will grip us.'.
    - Evidence 4: The budget deficit was 11% of GDP in 2009-10. It is now about 5.5% and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of UK predicts a surplus by the end of the decade..
    - Evidence 5: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Despite its negative reputation concerning its commitment to reforms and its implementation record, Greece has put forth an immense effort over the last three years and indeed has taken impressive steps toward achieving fiscal sustainability, with occasionally remarkable results. In the three years since the beginning of the crisis, it implemented a fiscal tightening of some 20% of GDP (around €50bn, while it has committed to measures cumulatively totalling €65bn by 2015) and reduced its budget deficit by an impressive nine percentage points, despite having lost a fifth of its GDP since 2009..
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.

","- Evidence 1: The budget deficit can be reduced by cutting spending and raising taxes.
- Evidence 2: The United States implemented austerity measures in the 1920s, such as cutting taxes, and saw real GNP growth.
- Evidence 3: The UK, for example, has seen real GNP growth since 2013, after implementing austerity measures, such as cutting wages and raising taxes."
We should adopt atheism,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: John Locke in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos..
    - Evidence 2: As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film The Golden Compass, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be watered down from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says denigrates Christianity and promotes atheism for kids, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief..
    - Evidence 3: The report also criticized the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship; they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'..
    - Evidence 4: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Atheism lacks morality.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life..
    - Evidence 2: nan.
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..
    - Evidence 3: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","We should adopt atheism. As the evidence shows, atheism is the only logical option available and the most morally responsible choice."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: Being an atheists often comes with contradictory ideologies that the society thrusts upon people but on the inside, atheists are free of conflicting ideas. They do not need to debate almost every time some stranger comments or offends any religion for they not believe in religion. They do not ever get into heated debates about which religion is better than the other..
    - Evidence 3: They believe in scientific explanations and do not dwell on mythologies that are most of the time impossible to believe in unless you are a blind follower. Their reasons and concepts are clear and they are happy about whatever they believe to be true. Satisfaction at heart is the most important thing people seek and atheism brings it in the most literary and non-mythical way..
    - Evidence 4: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
    - Evidence 5: I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A few years ago, in a conversation with fellow atheist Peter Boghossian, Richard Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
    - Evidence 3: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 4: Theodore Drange (2006)  has developed an argument that if God were the sort of being that wanted humans to come to believe that he exists, then he could bring it about that far more of them would believe than currently do.  God would be able, he would want humans to believe, there is nothing that he would want more, and God would not be irrational.  So God would bring it about that people would believe.  In general, he could have brought it about that the evidence that people have is far more convincing than what they have.  He could have miraculously appeared to everyone in a fashion that was far more compelling than the miracles stories that we have.  It is not the case that all, nearly all, or even a majority of people believe, so there must not be a God of that sort..
    - Evidence 5: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
    - Evidence 3: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
    - Evidence 4: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
    - Evidence 3: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
    - Evidence 4: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","- Evidence 1: There's no good reason to accept that atheism,
- Evidence 2: That there is no logical reason to accept that God exists,
- Evidence 3: In order to explain why theism. 
    - Evidence 1: That's why theism is not only works."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 2: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
    - Evidence 3: The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others..
    - Evidence 4: Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered..
    - Evidence 5: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
    - Evidence 3: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good..
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
    - Evidence 3: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

We should adopt libertarianism,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism increases economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Sustainability advocates Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins posited in their book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Free-market roads are advocated by libertarians, who consider them more efficient, safer, and more cost-effective than public roads ..
    - Evidence 3: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
    - Evidence 4: James Shikwati (born 1970) is a Kenyan libertarian economist and Director of the Inter Region Economic Network who promotes freedom of trade as the driving solution to poverty in Africa..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians also argue that freedom of speech and expression are crucial for protecting individual freedom. By allowing individuals to freely express their opinions and ideas, a libertarian system can promote greater diversity of thought and promote greater understanding and cooperation. For example, First Amendment scholar Floyd Abrams argues that freedom of speech and expression are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist F.A. Hayek argues that property rights are essential for allowing individuals to act freely and pursue their own interests..
    - Evidence 3: By allowing individuals and businesses to freely compete, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Adam Smith argues that competition is essential for promoting economic growth and well-being..
    - Evidence 4: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
    - Evidence 5: By allowing individuals to freely associate with others, a libertarian system can promote greater cooperation, understanding, and social support. For example, sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness..

I submit that there is only one why not, and this should be no news to libertarians who presumably believe in inalienable individual rights: namely, that no one has the right to coerce anyone not himself directly engaged in an overt act of aggression against rights..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians within YAF believed, for example, the military draft was a violation of the individual freedom the organization claimed to embrace..
    - Evidence 3: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
    - Evidence 4: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..

- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
    - Evidence 3: Cloning can also be used to improve the quality of life for people with certain medical conditions.

We should ban human cloning,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
    - Evidence 3: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..

    - Evidence 2: The Ministry of Health enacted the Danish Council Act 1988, which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos..
    - Evidence 3: Article 11 of UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights asserts that the reproductive cloning of human beings is contrary to human dignity..
    - Evidence 4: Hwang himself criticised the process, stating that it did not bring science any closer to human cloning and the complexities, coupled with the low success rate (one in 123), did not make it ethical to clone family pets..
    - Evidence 5: In 2001, when Germany and France proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an international convention to ban reproductive human cloning, the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included Spain, Philippines, the United States, and Costa Rica, noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Much of the concern related to human cloning stems from a fear of overstepping the bounds of the natural order..
    - Evidence 2: Rev.

    - Evidence 4: In 1997, he published a pseudo-autobiographical novel called The Mao Game about a fifteen-year-old child star attempting to cope with heroin addiction, memories of past sexual abuse, and the impending death of his grandmother, who has been diagnosed with cancer..
    - Evidence 5: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
","You may add the following evidence to support your argument:
  - Evidence 1: Many child actors find themselves struggling to adapt as they become adults. 
  - Evidence 2: There are numerous instances of troubled adult lives due to the stressful environment to which child actors are often subjected. 
  - Evidence 3: In 1997, Herbert published a pseudo-autobiographical novel called The Mao Game about a fifteen-year-old child star attempting to cope with heroin addiction, memories of past sexual abuse, and the impending death of his grandmother."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
    - Evidence 2: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 3: High-Value Enemy Combatant Defined.--In this section, the term  ``high-value enemy combatant'' means an enemy combatant who--(1) is a senior member of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group; (2) has knowledge of an imminent terrorist threat against the United States or its territories, the Armed Forces of the United States, the people or organizations of the United States, or an ally of the United States;  (3) has, or has had, direct involvement in planning or preparing a terrorist action against the United States or an ally of the United States or in assisting the leadership of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group in  planning or preparing such a terrorist action; or (4) if released from detention, would constitute a clear and continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the United States..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
    - Evidence 3: “The president has been really explicit ... that Gitmo is a very, very important tool,” Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said on Fox News this morning. It's also important to understand that Guantanamo Bay is an incredibly important intelligence asset..
    - Evidence 4: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..
    - Evidence 5: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..
","Evidence 1: In the CIA's enhanced interrogation program, detainees were subjected to techniques like waterboarding, sleep deprivation, and being kept in a stress position for extended periods of time, with Panetta confirming that these techniques were used against some of the most high-value detainees, including Bin Laden's courier and bodyguard.
  Evidence 2: Panetta also noted that the enhanced interrogation techniques used against some of Bin Laden's most trusted lieutenants produced crucial intelligence that was used to track down the terrorist leader.
 
  Evidence 3: This intelligence was instrumental in the successful mission to eliminate Bin Laden, with Panetta stating that the CIA's enhanced interrogation program was an invaluable asset in the hunt for the terrorist leader."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241..
    - Evidence 3: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
    - Evidence 4: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
    - Evidence 2: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 3: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
    - Evidence 4: Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad..
    - Evidence 5: The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
    - Evidence 3: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
    - Evidence 2: In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher..
    - Evidence 3: Since Congress decided to pursue austerity in 2011, it has chosen to spend at least $1.42 billion on the mission at Guantanamo, although it could have been accomplished for just $29.9 million..
    - Evidence 4: Simply by transferring the 84 detainees already cleared to leave Guantanamo, the United States could save nearly $2 billion over the next 10 years..
    - Evidence 5: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
    - Evidence 2: The CSRT applies a broad definition of enemy combatant that inevitably ensnares innocent people;  applies a presumption of guilt;  has no juries; disables prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence;  prohibits prisoners from having lawyers;   and relies on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely..
    - Evidence 3: A government report describes the facility as having been “modified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,” with doors that had been “sealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.” Inside, the walls were “covered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.” There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound..
    - Evidence 4: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
    - Evidence 5: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld later approved interrogation techniques in Guantánamo that included sleep deprivation, stress positions, nudity, sensory deprivation and threatening detainees with dogs..

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: 'This matters a great deal for access in the persistently White institutions that generally control the pathways to power in our society,' said Ed Wingenbach, president of Hampshire College, a liberal arts college in Amherst, Massachusetts..
    - Evidence 2: By the end of his tenure, UC was admitting more minority students than it was in 1997, the year before the ban on affirmative action took effect..
    - Evidence 3: Sander's paper on mismatching has been refuted by several law professors, including Ian Ayres and Richard Brooks from Yale who use Sander's data to show that eliminating affirmative action would actually reduce the number of black lawyers by 12.7% [REF]..
    - Evidence 4: A prominent advocate of affirmative action, he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases-Grutter v Bollinger and Gratz v Bollinger-that upheld and clarified the importance of diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education..
    - Evidence 5: In Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, the APALC submitted a brief supporting the University of Texas in preserving the use of affirmative action in admissions, saying Asian students 'benefited from exposure to a diverse student body.'.
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Elkins' views were influential during the late 1960s when Daniel Patrick Moynihan, supported Affirmative action programs in order to counteract the lingering effects of slavery on black culture..
    - Evidence 2: An opinion column in the Houston Chronicle after a similar sale took place at Texas A&M University held that 'Actions like these reinforce the common misconception that affirmative action policies give academically unqualified minority students a get-into-college-free card, and they ignore historical discrimination that denied nonwhites opportunities to be successful at any price, no matter their talents or intelligence.'.
    - Evidence 3: Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals..
    - Evidence 4: The justification for affirmative action is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture,[REF] and to address existing discrimination [REF]..
    - Evidence 5: As historian Roger Wilkins has pointed out, Blacks have a 375-year history on this continent: 245 involving slavery, 100 involving legalized discrimination, and only 30 involving anything else (Wilkins, 1995). Jews and Asians, on the other hand, have immigrated to North America—often as doctors, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs, and so forth. Moreover, European Jews are able to function as part of the White majority. To expect Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians is to deny the historical and social reality that Black people face..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve a range of goals: bridging inequalities in employment and pay; increasing access to education; enriching state, institutional, and professional leadership with the full spectrum of society; redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances, in particular addressing the apparent social imbalance left in the wake of slavery and slave laws..
    - Evidence 2: The government claimed that this was an affirmative action scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education..
    - Evidence 3: Affirmative action - provide positive preferential treatment in allotment of jobs and access to higher education, as a means to accelerate the integration of the SCs and STs with mainstream society..

    - Evidence 5: Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals..
","The government argued that affirmative action was necessary to compensate for past discrimination and to address existing imbalances, as evidenced by statistics showing disparities in employment and education. The data showed that Blacks were historically and internationally discriminated against in these areas, as well as being underrepresented in higher education and employment. Moreover, the government argued that affirmative action was also necessary to address the lingering effects of slavery and discrimination. The Supreme Court agreed, ruling that past discrimination had created an imbalance that needed to be corrected, and that affirmative action was necessary to ensure that minorities and women were given fair access to traditionally segregated job markets."

    - Evidence 3: Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticised as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger..
    - Evidence 4: Hardin's last book The Ostrich Factor: Our Population Myopia (1999), a warning about the threat of overpopulation to the Earth's sustainable economic future, called for coercive constraints on 'unqualified reproductive rights' and argued that affirmative action is a form of racism..

    - Evidence 4: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university..
    - Evidence 5: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..

We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..

We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, said Deepti Choubey, senior director of nuclear and bio-security at the Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington. These are the materials that a terrorist would use to make a kind of bomb that you would use for nuclear terrorism attacks and they are currently spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world..
    - Evidence 2: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
    - Evidence 3: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 4: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
    - Evidence 5: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 2: More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and other NATO countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a single nuclear warning shot, according to a terrifying simulation..
    - Evidence 3: Max Tegmark: Soviet Sub Captain Decides to Fire Nuclear Torpedo During Cuban Missile Crisis To me, this is both harrowing and educational: it shows how great risk can come from the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings that couldn’t start a nuclear war on their own, but can provide the perfect storm when combined. The fact that it remained secret for decades also suggests that there may be recent scary incidents that we haven’t yet heard of..
    - Evidence 4: David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack. Additionally, the fact that it happened so recently highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago..
    - Evidence 5: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..

We should fight urbanization,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deficient urban planning, densely Urbanization creates enormous social, economic and environmental changes, which provide an opportunity for sustainability with the 'potential to use resources more efficiently, to create more sustainable land use and to protect the biodiversity of natural ecosystems.’ condensed urbanization, and poverty are ongoing problems..
    - Evidence 2: While the city Meerut ranked in the bottom 10 in job creations, the report suggests that overall there are plenty of signs of potential for urbanisation, including future employment opportunities..
    - Evidence 3: A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities..
    - Evidence 4: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
    - Evidence 5: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city..
    - Evidence 2: Rapid urbanization drives economic growth and causes people to seek working and investment opportunities in urban areas..
    - Evidence 3: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
    - Evidence 4: For example, they argue that industrialization supports greater efficiency of agriculture through technology, an advantage for the productivity of rural farmers as well as urban consumers..
    - Evidence 5: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Biodiversity will play an increasingly important role within the urban landscape..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
    - Evidence 3: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..

- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The continuation of the economic decline combined with the increased population and urbanization led to decrease of agrarian production..
    - Evidence 2: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
    - Evidence 3: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: MÄori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid urbanisation and growing population have increased criminal activities in Bopal & Ghuma..

    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural activities largely contribute sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers..
    - Evidence 2: The problems facing the creeks are blamed on urbanization, which has deprived the creeks of needed sediment while increasing pollution..
    - Evidence 3: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
    - Evidence 4: Surveys showed that urbanization and coastal development, especially from tourism and agricultural sectors, contributed to increased degradation of the marine environment in the area..
    - Evidence 5: A specific concern is urbanization, which affects water quality by increasing its load of metals and organic contaminants..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The fast urbanization of Tagum from the late '80s to 1990 which was attributed to the mushrooming of business establishments and other commercial activities, increasing population and services and other factors, has caused various problems and needs, like roads, drainage, the increasing numbers of squatters, upscaling trend of traffic congestion in major streets, garbage and sanitation, land use and others..
    - Evidence 2: A recent study of 4.4 million men and women in Sweden found a 68%-77% increased risk of diagnosed psychosis for people living in the most urbanized environments, a significant proportion of which is likely to be described as schizophrenia..
    - Evidence 3: In the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and good-quality touristic services, so the fast process of urbanization, had the consequence of irregular neighbourhoods..
    - Evidence 4: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 5: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..
","The evidence suggests that urbanization has caused the emergence of slums, depopulation, environmental degradation, and increased crime rates. It is therefore necessary to consider the impact of urbanization and take measures to reduce its negative effects."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 3: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
    - Evidence 2: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
    - Evidence 3: Citizens have the right to choose whether they want to vote. Compulsion is part of a slippery slope to totalitarianism..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 3: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..
    - Evidence 2: nan.
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The compulsory voting system is an effective way to increase the civic engagement of citizens. However, it also carries the risk of uninformed votes and may lead to manipulation of election results. It is therefore important to provide incentives for citizens to become informed before voting, such as offering educational resources, providing financial rewards for voting, or even instituting a jury system to ensure that votes are cast responsibly."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study finds that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement in several ways..
    - Evidence 2: A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda by up to 20 percentage points..
    - Evidence 3: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Since voting at referendums in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory has been allowed in 1977, compulsory voting has also applied there..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
    - Evidence 3: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 3: A counter argument to opponents of compulsory voting is that in these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot..
    - Evidence 4: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 5: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..
","The introduction of compulsory voting in the United States has been met with widespread opposition, as evidenced by the opposition of the Electoral Commission. This opposition has been largely driven by fears of voter apathy, as evidenced by the low turnout in midterm elections. However, this argument is unconvincing as it does not account for the potential benefits of compulsory voting, such as increased political education and representation. Ultimately, compulsory voting should be encouraged to increase political engagement and representation, as evidenced by the high turnout in recent midterm elections."
We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
    - Evidence 2: A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke..
    - Evidence 3: For example, the Board representative is quoted as having said that we might end up in the next 10 or 20 years with our psychiatric hospitals filled with people who have problems with cannabis, and that a recent study by the British Lung Foundation found smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes..

    - Evidence 2: A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash..
    - Evidence 3: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
    - Evidence 2: Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs..
    - Evidence 3: The Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse..
    - Evidence 4: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
    - Evidence 5: Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Despite more than $7 billion spent annually towards arresting and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005, the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys.
    - Evidence 2: Despite over $7 billion spent annually towards arresting[REF] and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005 (FBI Uniform Crime Reports), the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys..
    - Evidence 3: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 4: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..

We should legalize cannabis,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: In 2001, the New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group stated that decriminalizing cannabis will result in greater availability of resources to respond to more serious crimes without any increased risks to public safety..
    - Evidence 3: Psychopharmacologist David Nutt argues, though he is against full declassification, that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco, which, if they were invented today would be illegal..
    - Evidence 4: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
    - Evidence 5: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
    - Evidence 3: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 3: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The Connecticut Law Revision Commission made the following evaluation: (1) the costs of arresting and prosecuting marijuana offenders were significantly lower in states that had done away with criminal penalties for possessing small amounts; (2) there was a greater increase in marijuana use in states that continue to treat possession as crime than in states that treated it as a civil offense; (3) easing the penalties for marijuana did not lead to a substantial increase in the use of either alcohol or hard drugs..
    - Evidence 2: The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many unintended negative consequences of drug enforcement..
    - Evidence 3: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
    - Evidence 4: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
    - Evidence 5: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..

We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
    - Evidence 2: One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana. The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia..
    - Evidence 3: Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes..
    - Evidence 4: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Additionally it is argued that the legalisation of prostitution would result in an increase in human trafficking and crime..
    - Evidence 2: Bob Herbert also stated that many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps: Despite the fiction that they are independent contractors,most so-called legal prostitutes have pimps - the state-sanctioned pimps who run the brothels and, in many cases, a second pimp who controls all other aspects of their lives (and takes the bulk of their legal earnings)..
    - Evidence 3: The United Nations stated in 2009 that sex trafficking is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking and estimates that about 79% of human trafficking reported is for prostitution.
    - Evidence 4: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
    - Evidence 5: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Regardless, the general consensus among most studies regarding violence against prostitutes is that rates of physical violence against prostitutes is extremely high, particularly among female sex workers (transgender inclusive) who experience higher rates of physical violence than their male counterparts..
    - Evidence 2: In theLos Angeles County Sheriff's Department 's study, they concluded that 70% of them had traumatizing experiences of physical violence, 40% of these women were involved in prostitution, and 84% of the women with children were incapable of taking care of them..
    - Evidence 3: University of Leeds research in 2015 found that 47% of prostitutes had been victims of crime, including rape and robbery, while 36% had received threatening texts, telephone calls or emails..
    - Evidence 4: A survey of female sex workers in Leeds, England, and Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland, revealed that 30% had been slapped, punched or kicked by a client while working, 13% had been beaten, 11% had been raped and 22% had experienced an attempted rape..
    - Evidence 5: Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence..
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..
    - Evidence 2: nan.
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Evidence 1: Legalizing prostitution would result in an increase of HIV infections, as the spread of prostitution is associated with higher rates of risky sexual behaviour, including condomless sex and multiple partners.
  Evidence 2: Legalizing prostitution would lead to higher rates of violence against women, as the act of prostitution is associated with higher rates of physical and psychological abuse, including threats, physical attacks and rape.
  Evidence 3: Studies conducted in the US have found that legalization of prostitution increases the likelihood of human trafficking, as the clients of prostitutes are more likely to be other criminals.
  Evidence 4: Registration of sex workers has been associated with higher rates of violence against women, as the act of prostitution is associated with physical and psychological abuse, including threats and rape.
  Evidence 5: Legalization of prostitution increases the likelihood of violence against women, as the spread of prostitution is associated with higher rates of physical and psychological abuse."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
    - Evidence 2: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The World Charter for Prostitutes Rights (1985), drafted by the International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights, calls for the decriminalisation of all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decision. Since the mid-1970s, sex workers across the world have organised, demanding the decriminalisation of prostitution, equal protection under the law, improved working conditions, the right to pay taxes, travel and receive social benefits such as pensions..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 3: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
    - Evidence 4: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
    - Evidence 5: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent..
    - Evidence 2: The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person. Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry..
    - Evidence 3: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
    - Evidence 4: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear..
    - Evidence 2: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 3: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 4: Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution in toto, there is some evidence that regulation of China's recreational venues has helped to create a legitimate female service worker with the right to refuse to engage in practices repugnant to the valid labour contract, as well as the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace..
    - Evidence 5: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
    - Evidence 2: For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word prostitution to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term criminal sexual acts..
    - Evidence 3: Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will. Most women make this decision themselves..
    - Evidence 4: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 5: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..

We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society . Charles Lockwood of Yale says, a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars..
    - Evidence 2: When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences..
    - Evidence 3: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
    - Evidence 4: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
    - Evidence 5: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son, while a deeply rooted son preference makes many families want a son..
    - Evidence 2: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
    - Evidence 3: In addition, primary care physicians voiced the concerns that sex selection led to invasive medical interventions in the absence of therapeutic indications, contributed to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex, and was not a solution to domestic violence..
    - Evidence 4: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
    - Evidence 5: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 3: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
    - Evidence 4: Under the tradition of son preference and the one-child policy, missing females in China are formed through sex-selective abortion, discrimination in care for females, and non-registration of girls at birth..
    - Evidence 5: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
","The opponents of legalizing sex selection argue that it will lead to gender imbalance, and this can be seen in the evidence presented. In particular, the opponents point out that such imbalances can already be seen in China, where the one-child policy has led to a surplus of males compared to females, as well as in India, where the same policy has led to an even greater surplus of males compared to females. Moreover, the opponents also draw attention to the fact that sex selection is not a solution to the problem of gender imbalance, as it is an invasive procedure that can lead to even more serious problems such as infant mortality and non-registration of girls at birth. Therefore, the opponents argue that legalizing sex selection is not an ethical solution to the problem of gender imbalance, as it will only worsen the situation and should not be encouraged."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Most families opt for unisex stuffs for babies before they are born. From clothes to toys, the color of the crib to the various necessities and accessories, everything is gender neutral in most cases. With gender selection or knowing baby’s gender can help every family to buy gender specific items. This not only does away with the ambiguity but actually helps the baby to get the best stuff as well. There is also a financial aspect as after the birthing of a baby, the parents always spend money on items that are for a boy or girl respectively. Knowing the gender or choosing gender allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The economic advantage is not oft talked about but it is significant..
    - Evidence 3: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
    - Evidence 4: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 4: There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire..
    - Evidence 5: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 3: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Evidence supporting claim:
  - Evidence 1: Gender selection can help intended parents to have a healthy baby of the gender they prefer.
  - Evidence 2: Prospective parents may wish to have a child of the gender they prefer.
  - Evidence 3: Gender selection can help parents to choose their preferred babyâs sex.
  - Evidence 4: Parents may choose the gender of their baby if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer.
  - Evidence 5: Gender selection can help parents to select the babyâs sex if they are willing to have a healthy baby of the gender they prefer."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In common usage, the phrase 'flag burning' refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest..
    - Evidence 2: In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7-2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:  In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth..
    - Evidence 3: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 5: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
    - Evidence 3: Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
","The majority opinion ruled that flag desecration is not a crime but an act of expression protected by the First Amendment. The dissenting opinion argued that the majority's ruling fails to take into account that flag desecration is not an act of expression, but one of destruction, and that the First Amendment does not protect such acts. The dissent argued that flag desecration should be considered a crime, and that the majority's opinion does not recognize this fact. The dissent further argued that the majority's opinion does not account for the potential harm that could arise from allowing flag desecration. The dissent argued that flag burning should be limited by the Government, as it could lead to other forms of destruction, such as the destruction of property. The dissent argued that the majority opinion fails to recognize the potential danger of allowing flag burning, and that such an action should be limited by the Government. The dissent argued that flag burning is not an act of expression, but an act of destruction and that the majority opinion fails to take into account the potential danger that could arise from allowing flag burning. The dissent argued that because of this, the majority opinion fails to take into account the potential danger of allowing flag burning, and as such, the majority's opinion should be overruled."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Under the 1983 Turkish flag law, burning the flag is strictly forbidden, punishable by a prison sentence of three years..
    - Evidence 2: Chief Justice Warren wrote that while the First Amendment does protect freedom of speech, it does not protect all things that may extraneously be labeled 'symbolic speech.
    - Evidence 3: In Austria flag desecration is illegal under Â§248 Strafgesetzbuch..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Rehnquist argued that flag burning is no essential part of any exposition of ideas but rather the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 4: According to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
",We should not prohibit flag burning. It is wrong to criminalize an act that is largely symbolic and has no direct negative consequences. Burning the flag is an expression of opinion that should not be suppressed.
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls and makes our communities safer and healthier. It is a human right and it is good for the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations. Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy. In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy..
    - Evidence 3: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
    - Evidence 4: Twenty-five years after the United Nations’ Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action pledged to take the necessary steps to “remove all obstacles to gender equality and the advancement and empowerment of women,” support for gender equality is strong around the globe. Across 34 countries surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 94% think it is important for women in their country to have the same rights as men, with 74% saying this is very important..
    - Evidence 5: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: As a health professional and a researcher, Mar Nagel found that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions. They have better social and communication skills than men, possess strong memory, are sophisticated and show precision and fast reaction and response time..
    - Evidence 3: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
    - Evidence 4: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
    - Evidence 5: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address..
    - Evidence 2: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 4: The more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed..
    - Evidence 5: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Nindl, et al. (p. 51, 2016), training programs increased the number of pull-ups that women were capable of, demonstrating that they could overcome their naturally smaller muscle mass. Additionally, their research found that women performed better than men in ultra-endurance, or the ability to physical endure for a given extended period of time. These studies suggest that women excel in some abilities, and that while men are indeed stronger as a physical typicality, there are exceptions and other ways that women can compete..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
    - Evidence 3: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 4: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
    - Evidence 2: In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty..
    - Evidence 3: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 4: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
    - Evidence 5: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
    - Evidence 2: Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country..
    - Evidence 3: While fewer women might achieve such levels, as Jon Soltz, notes: There are women who can meet these standards, and they have a right to compete..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role.

The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team.

We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
    - Evidence 3: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
    - Evidence 4: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
    - Evidence 2: In an interview with CNN on January 4, Maj. General Robert Dees, the campaign chair for Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, said he didn’t think it was a good idea: “If you look at the population demographics, most women…cannot properly carry a 230-pound soldier—with a rucksack and combat vest on—off of the battlefield to save his life..
    - Evidence 3: While the majority of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves.  In addition, combat units engage in activities designed to suit men’s capabilities. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this..
    - Evidence 4: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
    - Evidence 5: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: While it may be a feel-good move for many progressives, the end result might well be to lower the standards for all troops and damage the quality of the military..
    - Evidence 2: Lower female standards also reinforce the belief that women cannot perform the same job as men, therefore making it difficult for women to earn the trust and confidence of their teammates..
    - Evidence 3: Inconvenient truth is that men and women have been each other’s most consistent distraction since the beginning of time. To pretend that we don’t know what will happen when men and women are thrown together for prolonged periods in emotionally intense situations defies common sense. Being overly academic and insufficiently adult about adult behavior isn’t just irresponsible but imperiling, and belies the deadly seriousness with which we should want combat units to perform..
    - Evidence 4: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
    - Evidence 5: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected..
    - Evidence 3: 1988 – The DoD convenes its Task Force on Women in the Military and adopts the “risk rule,” which excludes women from combat units or missions which risk exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture..
    - Evidence 4: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
    - Evidence 5: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
    - Evidence 2: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..

We should subsidize journalism,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Government intervention has the risk of inserting bias/harming objectivity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Increased governmental controlling of journalists' media access freedom of expression can lead to the need of finding new and less controlled ways of expression..
    - Evidence 2: The Public Journalism Network explains that journalism and democracy work best when news, information and ideas flow freely; when news portrays the full range and variety of life and culture of all communities; when public deliberation is encouraged and amplified; and when news helps people function as political actors and not just as political consumers...
    - Evidence 3: In the fierce competitive environment that followed commercial interests became paramount and quality journalism gave way to sensationalism..
    - Evidence 4: Political endorsements create more opportunities to construe favoritism in reporting, and can create a perceived conflict of interest..
    - Evidence 5: It’s just wrong. If government funds, government will regulate. Freedom of the press has to include freedom for the press to fail..
- claim_2: It is preferable to spend the money elsewhere.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Postal subsidies from our nation’s early founding (cited as a precedent by Downie/Schudson and McChesney/Nichols) are irrelevant. We had one communication medium then, newspapers. In today’s world of multiple forms of print, broadcast and digital communication, federal subsidies would decide winners and losers, protecting inefficient companies and creating huge obstacles for entrepreneurs..

We should subsidize journalism,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In Europe, the European Court of Human Rights stated in the 1996 case of Goodwin v. United Kingdom that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom .. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest..
    - Evidence 2: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..
    - Evidence 3: According to a Zogby International survey, 70% of Americans say journalism is important to maintaining community quality of life, and 67% say the traditional media are out of touch with what citizens want from their news..
    - Evidence 4: Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting..
    - Evidence 5: When news media lost a sizable percentage of their advertising revenues in the pandemic, state subsidies became more important than ever in securing the financial viability of media markets..
- claim_2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news..
    - Evidence 2: A study authorized by the Trilateral Commission in 1975 to examine the governability of American democracy found that the most notable new source of national power in 1970, as compared to 1950, was the national media, suggesting also that there was considerable evidence to suggest that the development of television journalism contributed to the undermining of governmental authority..
    - Evidence 3: Solutions journalism practitioners say the approach augments and complements the press' traditional watchdog role, presenting citizens with a more complete view of issues. In addition, they say, it can enhance the impact of investigative reporting, by presenting evidence that entrenched problems can, in fact, be solved..
    - Evidence 4: MacLean argues that education in journalism helps empower members of the public to understand how media work..
    - Evidence 5: In the words of a 2011 report from the Oxford School for the Study of Journalism and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, Mainstream media is the lifeblood of topical social media conversations in the UK..
- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The IFJ launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative in 2008, a global campaign to defend standards and to raise awareness of the importance of quality journalism..
    - Evidence 2: The IPD journalism program helps strengthen journalists' economic literacy and equips them to report and write about the major economic issues confronting developing economies..
    - Evidence 3: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Subsidy increases objectivity in reporting.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Peace journalism, by presenting anomalous local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism, may help to expose these violent group's attempts to fix and naturalise meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence..
    - Evidence 2: nan.
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","We should subsidize journalism to ensure its continued viability, quality and objectivity. This is because journalism is a powerful tool for keeping citizens informed and empowered. By providing financial support to news organizations and journalists, governments can ensure that citizens have access to reliable, accurate information. Subsidies also help to ensure that news outlets remain financially viable and are able to continue publishing in the face of declining advertising revenues. We should also recognize the importance of investigative journalism in uncovering abuses of power, corruption and other injustices, and provide financial support for such endeavors."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
    - Evidence 2: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 3: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
    - Evidence 4: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
    - Evidence 2: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 3: Rockets and spaceflight instruments do not assemble themselves. They are designed and built by people, who get paid. They are fabricated from components which have to be manufactured and then purchased. The community engaged in the space industry includes specialist scientists and engineers, designers, graphic artists and IT professionals, as well as a vast support system: HR, catering, cleaning, etc..
    - Evidence 4: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
    - Evidence 5: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
    - Evidence 2: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 3: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
    - Evidence 4: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
    - Evidence 3: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
    - Evidence 4: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..

We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,alpaca,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe..
    - Evidence 3: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
    - Evidence 4: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
    - Evidence 5: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars..
    - Evidence 2: Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence..
    - Evidence 3: An artist’s concept of New Horizons during the spacecraft’s planned encounter with Pluto and its moon Charon. The craft’s miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and space plasma experiments would characterize the global geology and geomorphology of Pluto and Charon, map their surface compositions and temperatures, and examine Pluto’s atmosphere in detail..
    - Evidence 4: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
    - Evidence 5: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more. We're constantly evolving and finding new ways to add value..
    - Evidence 2: Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA’s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations..
    - Evidence 3: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 4: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Every year, about a thousand technical innovations generated in the space program find their ways into our earthly technology where they lead to better kitchen appliances and farm equipment, better sewing machines and radios, better ships and airplanes, better weather forecasting and storm warning, better communications, better medical instruments, better utensils and tools for everyday life..
    - Evidence 2: Space Exploration for the Survival of the Human Race.
    - Evidence 3: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
    - Evidence 4: Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites – which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path – to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns..
    - Evidence 5: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration of our solar system and distant galaxies in the furthest reaches of the Universe is important to top-level science and the answers to many fundamental scientific questions including formation of the Universe, the origin of Earth, Evolution of life, and the Existence of life beyond the Earth. Space robotics plays a critical role in the current and future space exploration missions, and enables mission-defined machines that are capable of surviving in the space environment, and performing exploration, assembly, construction, maintenance, or servicing tasks..
    - Evidence 2: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
    - Evidence 3: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..
    - Evidence 4: space exploration, investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches of the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","- Evidence 1: With the support of space exploration, humanity has the potential to advance beyond the Earth in the solar system, and the use of space robotic missions, and the development of the space exploration. 
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration has become a key to advancements in the solar system, and the use of the space exploration technologies, robotic space exploration, uncreation, assembly, and robotic technology, and its use.
