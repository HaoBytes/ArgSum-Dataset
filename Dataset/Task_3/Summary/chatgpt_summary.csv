Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
","The opponents of the statement 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence' argue that it should not be made a criminal offence because it gives dignity to the person who wants to commit it, reduces suffering, people should have the freedom to choose to end their life, and the terminally ill would benefit from it. They provide evidence supporting their claims such as the popularity of the term 'death with dignity', criteria of due care concerning patient's request and suffering, physician-assisted suicide, and the wish of terminally ill patients to die by assisted suicide before their disease progresses to a critical point."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'. The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made..
- claim_3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text..
- claim_4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
","The topic of the debate is whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offense. Supporters of this stance argue that assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die for their own benefit, violates the doctor's role, and people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. They also argue that assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better and people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others. Evidence supporting these arguments includes the requirement that the patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated', physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent, and the slippery slope argument which claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia. Overall, supporters of this stance believe that the dangers of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweigh any advantages to assisted suicide or safeguards in the initiative's text."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The agency provides Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
","The debate topic is whether homeschooling should be banned. Those who oppose the ban argue that homeschooling is often the best option for exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students. They provide evidence that many services, such as special education, are available to homeschoolers through district schools and private schools. Additionally, homeschooling allows for a personalized education tailored to the child's pace and needs, as evidenced by personal accounts. Supporters of homeschooling also argue that mainstream schools have a lot of violence and bullying, as noted by a statement from 1980. Parents should have the right to choose their child's education, as they have a deeper understanding of their child's progress and want to provide a learning environment free from government control and institutions. Finally, homeschooling provides a good learning environment, with opportunities for active learning and a broader socialization experience than traditional classrooms. Therefore, they conclude that homeschooling should not be banned."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
","The debate is whether or not homeschooling should be banned. The supporters of the motion argue that homeschooling should be banned for several reasons. Firstly, homeschooling cannot be regulated or standardized, which leads to poor quality education. For example, a mother who homeschooled her seven children for 18 years in Nebraska, lacked the energy and time to provide quality education due to constant pregnancies, and the lack of regulation allowed her to get away with shoddy homeschooling. Secondly, mainstream schools are essential for developing social skills that homeschooled children miss out on, such as work experience opportunities, participation in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward. Thirdly, mainstream schools provide higher educational quality, as stated by the National Education Association. Lastly, parents are not qualified as teachers, which can lead to a one-sided point of view for students as their parents may unknowingly block or diminish all points of view except their own."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'.
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Mayo Clinic states that natural infection 'often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.'.
","The proponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations argue that:
- counterclaim_1: The benefits of routine child vaccinations outweigh the potential risks.
  Evidence supporting counterclaim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in preventing serious and sometimes deadly diseases.
    - Evidence 2: The risk of serious complications from vaccines is extremely low and much lower than the risks of the diseases they prevent.
- counterclaim_2: Mandatory vaccinations are necessary to protect public health.
  Evidence supporting counterclaim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccines prevent the spread of diseases and help to achieve herd immunity, protecting those who cannot receive vaccines due to medical reasons.
    - Evidence 2: Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and whooping cough, have been on the rise in recent years due to lack of vaccination.
- counterclaim_3: Mandating vaccinations is consistent with other public health measures.
  Evidence supporting counterclaim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Other public health measures, such as seatbelt laws and smoking bans, have been implemented to protect the public's health and safety.
    - Evidence 2: Mandatory vaccination policies have been successful in other countries, such as Australia, in reducing the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
","The topic of debate is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory or not. Those in favor of the topic presented five claims supported by various pieces of evidence. Firstly, routine child vaccinations are effective as evidenced by studies that showed a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Secondly, child vaccination saves lives, with an estimation that full vaccination of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections. Thirdly, routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others, as evidenced by an outbreak of measles that infected 34 people, mostly children, and virtually all unvaccinated. Fourthly, routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading, with smallpox, a contagious and deadly disease, killing an estimated 300-500 million people in the 20th century before it was finally eradicated. Lastly, children should not suffer from preventable diseases, as vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year. Based on this evidence, routine child vaccinations should be made mandatory."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
","The topic of the debate is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. Opponents argue against regulation, presenting several claims and evidence to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that social media regulation is not effective, citing the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act as examples of legislation that have had little impact on the data-collection practices of companies like Facebook and Google. Secondly, opponents contend that social media regulation harms privacy, with most people feeling they have little control over how their personal information is used. Thirdly, they argue that regulation harms freedom of speech and other democratic rights, pointing to examples of countries like Vietnam where vague prohibitions on posts have restricted press freedom. Fourthly, opponents assert that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, as it may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency. Lastly, they argue that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government, citing examples of political advertisements targeting minority communities during elections to suppress voting and political participation."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
","The debate centers around whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government, and the affirmative side believes that it should be. Firstly, they argue that social media regulation protects younger audiences from potential harm online. The evidence supporting this argument is a quote from Norman Lamb, which states that the government must establish an independent, statutory regulator to protect young people online. Secondly, they argue that regulation is necessary to deal with fake news. The evidence supporting this argument is a statistic stating that a solid majority of Americans believe that major news organizations routinely produce false information. Thirdly, they argue that social media regulation is beneficial to society at large. The evidence supporting this argument is the proposed legislation in the European Union that seeks to make social media platforms more transparent and to outlaw psychologically manipulative techniques designed to keep users engaged. Fourthly, they argue that social media regulation can help deal with negative content. The evidence supporting this argument is a quote from Richard Pursey, stating that online safety is a fundamental human right, and forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety. Lastly, they argue that social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users. The evidence supporting this argument is a statistic stating that 13% of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user."

- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:

This put worry about crime second to concern about road traffic collisions (73%)..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Nearly three in ten Asian Americans report experiencing racial slurs or jokes since the start of the pandemic, over 6,600 incidents of hate crime (including physical attacks on Asian elders) have been reported nationwide, and six women were murdered at three Asian-owned spas in Georgia in March 2021..
","The opponents of the topic argue that the USA is not a good country to live in due to several reasons. Firstly, the country has unfair health and education policies that disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic adults. Additionally, the political system is problematic and divisive, as the parties have intensified their divisions over time, making it harder to find common ground. Secondly, the country's culture is negative and misuses digital technology, spreads false information, promotes sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and influences music, television, and films. Thirdly, the country has high taxation and a high cost of living that disproportionately affects Manhattan families. Fourthly, there is inequality and poverty, with 750,000 homeless Americans, disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people, veterans, and disabled. Fifthly, the country is unsafe, with 65% of people worried about violent crime. Finally, the country is xenophobic and racist, with incidents of hate crimes against Asian Americans and women murdered at Asian-owned spas. Therefore, the opponents argue that the USA is not a good country to live in due to these various reasons."

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
","The opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy argue that it should be maintained for several reasons. Firstly, they argue that celibacy allows priests to focus solely on God, freeing them from other obligations and enabling them to deepen their spiritual lives. This is supported by the teachings of Paul and the increased solitude that comes from being away from the demands of family. Secondly, opponents argue that celibacy is a strong religious belief, supported by the encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus by Pope Paul VI. Thirdly, celibacy makes priests appear holy and draws on the love of God, which gives them a limitless horizon and deepens their sense of responsibility. Fourthly, opponents argue that priests choose to be celibates, as evidenced by the vows taken in front of the Bishop of Limburg. Fifthly, opponents argue that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, as celibacy is a duty that has been observed since apostolic times. Finally, opponents argue that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, as evidenced by the Archbishop of Vienna, who connected celibacy with the sex abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic Church."

    - Evidence 1: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
","The debate is centered on whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned. Those in support of abandoning celibacy argue that it is outdated, too pressuring, unhealthy/unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behavior, and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. Evidence shows that the vow of celibacy is outdated as even the Pope had commuted the vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity in 1540. Additionally, celibacy is a difficult lifestyle, as it is not just biology, but sexual chemistry that makes it difficult. Celibacy is also an unnatural act in nature, and all living organisms are meant to reproduce. Evidence shows that celibacy leads to wrong sexual behavior, as allegations of sexual abuse were made against priests and deacons in the United States in 2004. Lastly, celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests, as expressed by Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck, an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, who supported the ordination of women and ending clerical celibacy to address the priest shortage in 1971."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
","The opponents of the idea of abandoning marriage argue that it has various benefits. Firstly, marriage benefits children as they receive gender-specific support from both parents, which is crucial for their development. Secondly, marriage holds immense religious and traditional significance, and is considered as one of the greatest blessings in life. It helps in raising children in a healthy family environment, which has lasting benefits. Thirdly, married people tend to be happier than unmarried people. Fourthly, marriage brings couples closer and fosters a strong sense of trust. Lastly, marriage provides significant financial benefits, including higher savings, lower tax brackets, cheaper insurance coverage, and eligibility for a larger Social Security benefit. Overall, abandoning marriage would mean giving up on these benefits and advantages."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
","The debate topic is whether we should abandon marriage. Those who support this idea argue that marriage preserves harmful norms for women, marriages are unstable, marriages tie people up with unfair obligations, and most of the advantages of marriage can be achieved through monogamy. The first argument presented is that marriage is harmful to women because it enforces rigid gender roles that require women to be submissive to their husbands, leading to physical violence as punishment for transgressions. The second argument is that marriages are unstable, as divorce rates have increased globally since the 1970s. The third argument is that marriages tie people up with unfair obligations, such as in Qatar where women need male guardian permission to marry and can be considered disobedient if they do not follow their husband's wishes. Lastly, the argument is made that most of the benefits of marriage can be achieved through monogamous relationships."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..

We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","The debate topic is whether or not we should abandon the use of school uniforms. Those in support of abandoning school uniforms argue that uniforms harm learning and creativity, as well as self-expression. Research shows that conformity is emphasized, while creativity is not valued. Additionally, schools with a uniform policy have lower self-perception rates than those without. School uniforms are also expensive and can be a financial burden for some families. Furthermore, school uniforms can be uncomfortable and can perpetuate sexist attitudes. Finally, uniforms increase conformity and can limit individuality. It is argued that allowing children to dress themselves encourages independent thinking and prepares them for adulthood."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
","The opponents of abolishing capital punishment present three main arguments in favor of retaining it. Firstly, they argue that the death penalty provides closure and justice to the victim and their family. They cite Henry McMaster, the Governor of South Carolina, who stated that the death penalty is necessary to provide victims' families with justice and closure. Secondly, they argue that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes. The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. Lastly, they contend that the death penalty deters crime. David Muhlhausen, a Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, argues that the majority of studies find a deterrent effect of capital punishment, and it saves lives. However, these arguments are not sufficient to justify the continued use of the death penalty, as there are other factors to consider, such as the risk of wrongful convictions, the potential for discrimination, and the moral implications of state-sanctioned killing."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
","The topic of the debate is whether we should abolish capital punishment, and those in favor of abolishing capital punishment present the following arguments:
Firstly, state-sanctioned killing is fundamentally wrong, as the death penalty system in the US is unjustly applied, with people of color being more likely to be executed, innocent people being sentenced to death, and a disproportionate impact based on factors such as the victim's race and the location of the crime.
Secondly, the death penalty harms the disenfranchised, as it diverts resources from other cases and costs significantly more than non-death penalty cases. This cost includes the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses.
Lastly, the death penalty is irreversible, as there is no evidence that it prevents crime, and it has been proven that murder rates are lower in states without the death penalty. Therefore, it is inhumane, discriminatory, arbitrary, and often claims innocent lives. As it is disappearing from legal systems around the world, it is time for all nations, including the United States, to end it."

- claim_2: Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Many economists believe that, in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced, because there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organisations to produce them.
- claim_3: Intellectual property rights protect against stealing.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If we want to continue to lead the world in producing intellectual property, we need to protect Americans' rights in that property, stated Senator Leahy..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intellectual property rights (IPRs) - IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation)..
","The opponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that such rights incentivize creativity and innovation, as codifying intellectual property for plant breeders encourages the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society. Additionally, intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products, as many economists believe that without such protections, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced. These rights also protect against stealing and allow for compensation for people or businesses who own their innovations. Senator Leahy states that protecting Americans' rights in their intellectual property is essential to continue leading the world in producing intellectual property. Therefore, the opponents believe that intellectual property rights should not be abolished."

Thirdly, they argue that intellectual property rights are unfair, particularly in the context of developing countries and poor patients. Fourthly, they claim that intellectual property rights harm creativity and innovation, using the same example of Fox Talbot's patent. Fifthly, they assert that intellectual property rights waste money, especially when products involve complex methods, designs, and processes.

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws.  A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.

- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
","The opponents of the proposition that 'we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms' argue that gun control is ineffective since criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms illegally. Furthermore, they argue that gun ownership is a right, as established by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. They also state that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports-shooting, as shown by data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Lastly, they argue that gun ownership promotes self-protection, as indicated by a Gallup survey where gun owners cited personal safety as the primary reason for owning firearms."

We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Nationally, local authority budgets were cut by nearly a third from 2010 to 2018, according to the UK National Audit Office and the public health grant fell by £700m in real terms between 2014/15 and 2019/20, as revealed by a Health Foundation report. Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,.
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","The opponents of adopting an austerity regime have presented several claims and supporting evidence to back up their stance. Claim 1 argues that austerity cuts access to essential services, and evidence shows that local authority budgets and public health grants were significantly reduced, leading to the closure of public services such as Sure Start centers and libraries. Claim 2 states that austerity extends recessions, with economists pointing out that these measures have contractionary effects that exacerbate ongoing economic recessions. Claim 3 highlights that austerity is unfair to citizens, with high levels of child poverty being declared a social calamity and an economic disaster by the UN's rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. Claim 4 presents evidence that austerity results in lower growth, as seen in Greece's economy after the EU and European Central Bank embarked on an austerity program to control the country's finances. Finally, Claim 5 argues that austerity results in lower job creation, with evidence showing that countries with stronger employment protection legislation experienced more unemployment due to austerity policies. Overall, opponents of austerity believe that it causes harm to citizens and economies and should not be adopted."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
","The debate topic is whether we should adopt an austerity regime. Supporters argue that austerity has many benefits. Firstly, they claim that austerity improves economic measures, as evidenced by Latvia and Estonia's fast economic growth after adopting fiscal austerity. Secondly, austerity is important in the long term as cutting budget deficits increases investor confidence, encouraging private sector investment. The EU points to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg, and Sweden as proof of austerity's effectiveness. Thirdly, austerity increases stability, as seen in Morocco, which experienced economic stability, steady growth, low inflation rates, and reduced unemployment after implementing austerity measures. Fourthly, austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts. The World Bank found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period, it slows economic growth, and every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth. Finally, austerity is essential in economically troubled times, such as the global economic downturn that began in 2008. Several European countries turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns. Therefore, adopting an austerity regime has many benefits that cannot be ignored."
We should adopt atheism,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: John Locke in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos..
- claim_2: Atheism lacks morality.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life..
- claim_3: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
","The opponents of adopting atheism put forward three main claims. Firstly, they argue that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. This is evidenced by the fact that John Locke believed that denying the existence of God would lead to chaos and undermine the social order. Secondly, they claim that atheism lacks morality and that belief in a higher power is necessary to provide a rational and coherent account of why an individual should lead a morally responsible life. Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, supports this argument. Finally, opponents argue that people should be able to choose for themselves whether to adopt atheism. According to Liddle, choosing to believe in God or not is ultimately a matter of personal choice, as there is no scientific proof either way."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
","The debate topic is whether or not we should adopt atheism, and the positive supporters of atheism argue the following points. Firstly, they claim that atheism is beneficial to the person who adopts it because it provides a superior basis for ethics. This is because atheists are more inclined to evaluate moral imperatives from an external basis instead of religious dogma. Secondly, atheism should be adopted because we cannot prove that God exists. Atheist Michael Scriven argues that atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence. Thirdly, religions are immoral, and people should not follow them. This is because religion confuses obedience with morality, and obedience is amoral at best, and utterly irresponsible at worst. Lastly, science can adequately explain the universe, which is why we do not need to rely on the existence of a divine being to explain the world. While some critics may argue against these points from a theistic standpoint, the positive supporters of atheism argue that it represents a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective."

- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
","The topic at hand is whether we should adopt libertarianism. The opponents of this stance argue that libertarianism can be harmful in several ways. Firstly, they claim that libertarianism harms economic growth and cite George Monbiot's article in The Guardian linking Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy to the failure of Northern Rock. Secondly, opponents argue that libertarianism harms minorities and those who are worse off. They mention philosopher Robert Nozick's argument that a consistently libertarian society would allow consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, which would be unjust. Thirdly, opponents argue that libertarianism is unjust and non-equal. They argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and result in unequal outcomes.

- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
","The supporters of libertarianism argue that we should adopt this political philosophy for various reasons. Firstly, they claim that libertarianism increases economic growth, citing the book "

- claim_4: Cloning promotes science/research.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 specifically permitted human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells, and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research in the state..
","The opponents of the ban on human cloning present four claims to support their stance. First, cloning can be used for organ replication to address the shortage of organs available for transplantation, which causes many people to die while waiting for suitable organs. Second, cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility to have genetically related children. Third, cloning promotes health as it could be used to produce stem cells that could treat a range of diseases. Lastly, cloning promotes science and research as certain states in the US permit human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells, and certain forms of embryonic stem cell research are legalized in other states."

","The debate topic is whether or not human cloning should be banned, and the positive supporters argue in favor of a ban. They make four main claims to support their stance. First, they argue that cloning is not yet understood well enough to be safely practiced, and provide evidence that allowing cloning would be a dangerous and unethical decision for society. Second, they argue that cloning is unethical and anti-religious, and provide evidence from Pope John Paul II that the manipulation and destruction of human embryos involved in cloning is morally unacceptable. Third, they claim that cloning is unnatural and provide evidence from a Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist that humans are meant to be created through acts of love, not the manipulation of cells. Finally, they argue that cloning is unsafe and provide evidence from an FDA biotechnology chief that cloning could risk transferring sexually transmitted diseases to newborn children.

    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
","The supporters of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp have presented several compelling arguments. Firstly, the detainees have the right to a fair trial in US courts, as per the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of Boumediene v. Bush. Secondly, the camp harms the reputation of the United States and serves as a recruiting tool for terrorists. Thirdly, the detention camp is a symbol of discrimination and injustice, and has become a catastrophic failure. Fourthly, the camp is expensive to run, costing an estimated $540 million annually. Fifthly, there have been allegations of crimes committed by personnel against the prisoners, including sexual humiliation, waterboarding, and the use of vicious dogs. Lastly, unjust treatment tactics have been used in the camp, such as stress positions, isolation, and deprivation of stimuli. Based on these arguments, the supporters of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp make a strong case for ending the controversial facility."
We should end affirmative action,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.

- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.

","The opponents of ending affirmative action put forth three key claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that affirmative action boosts diversity. Evidence shows that students of color experience a 23% decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect.

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..

- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
","The proponents of ending affirmative action make the following claims: Firstly, affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, as it devalues their accomplishments and is counterproductive. Secondly, affirmative action is ineffective, as evidenced by Arizona's Proposition 107 which banned government-sponsored affirmative action. Thirdly, affirmative action is not just, as Asian-American students are marked down on "

Those in support of the proposition argue that a mandatory retirement age should be ended because it decreases institutional knowledge, harms the economy, is not fair/discriminatory, reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, and we should let everyone retire when they are ready. To support their argument, they present evidence such as the absence of a mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers in the UK, a study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 which found that mandatory retirement ages can impede workforce diversity, and a report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 which found that mandatory retirement ages can result in age discrimination, among others.

We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
","As an expert debater, I will present a summary of the arguments and evidence presented by the opponents of the proposition that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons.

The opponents of the proposition argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. They believe that deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years.

Therefore, they argue that having nuclear weapons deters other countries from attacking and provides a sense of security and protection. They contend that countries with nuclear weapons are less likely to engage in war as the consequences of using such weapons are catastrophic.

However, it is important to note that the proposition to fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons is based on the premise that the use of such weapons is unacceptable and poses an existential threat to humanity. This argument is supported by evidence of the devastating effects of nuclear weapons, including long-lasting radiation, destruction of infrastructure, and loss of human life.

In conclusion, while the opponents of the proposition make a valid argument for the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence, it is important to consider the larger implications of possessing such weapons and the potential catastrophic consequences of their use. Therefore, the abolition of nuclear weapons should remain a top priority in the quest for global peace and security."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
","The debate topic is whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. The positive supporters argue that nuclear weapons should be abolished because they can fall into the wrong hands and provoke or escalate a disastrous military action. The evidence supporting the first argument is that recent propaganda from ISIS has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within a year, and history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare has never been a top priority. The second argument is supported by the evidence that in the event of a Soviet nuclear attack during the Cold War, the US would have sent thousands of nuclear weapons to targets in multiple countries, resulting in millions of deaths due to radioactive fallout and short-range missiles. Therefore, to prevent catastrophic consequences, we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons."

    - Evidence 1: Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
","The debate topic is 'We should fight urbanization'. Opponents of this argument presented three claims supporting urbanization. The first claim is that cities offer more opportunities, and this is evidenced by the fact that people often migrate to urban areas in search of better lives. The second claim is that urbanization benefits the economy, supported by new government policies that encourage the privatisation of agriculture, the urbanisation of rural populations, the development of rural industries and international investment. The third claim is that urbanization benefits the environment by driving innovation, including green technologies that will determine the future of the green economy."
We should fight urbanization,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: MÄori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
","The supporters of fighting urbanization have made four claims. The first claim is that restrictions on migration would benefit people in rural areas economically and socially. They provide evidence from Venezuela, where rural areas have suffered from economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment, resulting in high urbanization rates and food dependency. The second claim is that urbanization causes crime. They provide evidence from Māori communities in New Zealand that have struggled to deal with social issues, including a rise in urban crime, poverty, and health problems. The third claim is that urbanization harms the environment. They provide evidence that increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies, and many parts of the world do not have access to clean, safe water. Finally, the fourth claim is that urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources. They provide evidence from a UNESCO report that details the negative effects of overurbanization, including inadequate housing, a lack of sanitary facilities, filth, squalor, repugnant odors, disease, high mortality rates, and limited access to educational facilities."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
- claim_4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..
","The opponents of the introduction of compulsory voting make four main claims. Firstly, abstaining from a vote can also reflect a person's preferences. This is because abstention can indicate ambivalence or mild disapproval, or a lack of adequate information or participation in relevant discussion. Secondly, citizens have the right not to vote and compulsory voting violates freedom of speech as it is a compelled speech act. Thirdly, compulsory voting can lead to uninformed or random voting as uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of misleading advertising. Lastly, not everyone has the ability to go to vote and some people may vote based on intentional disinformation."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
","The topic of the debate is whether or not we should introduce compulsory voting. Those in favor of introducing compulsory voting argue that it would increase representation, political education, and that people have an obligation to vote. The first argument in support of this is that compulsory voting increases representation. A report by Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne Jr. shows that boosting turnout is a matter of justice and representation, as disparities in turnout between different groups are a cause for concern. The second argument is that compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics, which will lead to higher political education. If people know that they must vote, they will be more likely to pay attention to politics. Finally, supporters argue that people have an obligation to vote. The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 1971 that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms because only attendance at a polling station, and not voting itself, is compulsory.

- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
- claim_5: Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Take California for example: first in the nation to legalize the medical use of the drug in 1996, the state would go on to legalize recreational use in 2016. But in just the past year, the state reported several massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza – just over the last three or four months..
","The opponents of legalizing cannabis present five main arguments. Firstly, they argue that cannabis harms the body, citing a study which found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Secondly, opponents claim that cannabis increases lack of judgement and accidents, citing claims that it causes people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. Thirdly, they argue that cannabis is a gateway drug and addictive, as THC triggers brain cells to release dopamine and repeated use could lead to addiction, which is a brain disease. Fourthly, opponents claim that legal cannabis can easily get into the hands of underage teenagers and children, citing the example of UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown opposing cannabis reclassification as it sends out a message to teenagers that it is acceptable. Finally, they argue that legalizing cannabis will boost the black-market and criminal activity, citing several recent busts of illegal cannabis operations in California despite it being legalized for medical and recreational use."

- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..
","The debate topic is whether cannabis should be legalized. The positive supporters argue that cannabis should be legalized for the following reasons. Firstly, they argue that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal. For example, a 2002 DAWN report in the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found, while legal drugs such as tobacco and alcohol cause more than half a million deaths a year. Secondly, legalizing cannabis is financially beneficial as it can reduce government spending on prohibition enforcement and generate billions in annual tax revenues through taxation and regulation. Thirdly, cannabis has therapeutic benefits, as it is safe, healthy and can provide pain relief. Fourthly, if cannabis was legalized, it could be regulated, which would lead to a decrease in its use, especially among young people. Fifthly, legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market and criminal activity, which can benefit the society at large. Lastly, people should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies, and the government should not intervene to prevent individuals from using cannabis if it does not harm others. The proponents of the legalization of cannabis cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill, who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society."

Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..

Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
","The debate topic is about whether or not prostitution should be legalized. Those who support the legalization of prostitution argue that it has several benefits. Firstly, legalizing prostitution would boost the economy. This is evident in Seattle, where prostitution was considered a functional part of the economy and was supported by the city's founder, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard. Secondly, legalizing sex work would increase sex workers' benefits such as healthcare, safe sex, and unionization. Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health, and human rights. Thirdly, legalization would allow for regulation of those in the profession, such as in Las Vegas, where brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex. Fourthly, legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women. The policy of tolerance towards prostitution in the Netherlands was based on harm reduction, with the belief that enforcement of anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect women was to tolerate prostitution. Lastly, sex work is considered a valid choice over one's body, and a study found that among sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized. Overall, supporters of the legalization of prostitution argue that it would have various positive outcomes and benefits."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
","The opponents argue that we should not legalize sex selection. Firstly, sex selection can lead to gender imbalance, as evidenced by the disproportionate number of men to women in countries such as China and India where having a male child is preferred. Secondly, sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases, which can persist even in modernized and urban areas. Finally, legalizing sex selection could lead to more abortions and infanticide, particularly in areas where there is a strong son preference and strict family planning policies such as the one-child policy in China. These reasons suggest that legalizing sex selection is not a desirable option."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
","The debate topic is whether we should legalize sex selection or not. The supporters of this argument have put forward several claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that it is a basic right of parents to select the sex of their child, as most people have a preference for a particular gender. Secondly, sex selection allows for better family planning as parents can control the number of children they want. Thirdly, sex selection makes the family more happy and complete by fulfilling their desired gender preferences. Fourthly, sex selection can prevent X-linked diseases from being passed down to the child. Finally, legalizing sex selection can prevent abortions and infanticide as parents can choose the gender of their child without the need for such actions. While these arguments may seem compelling, the opposing side may argue that legalizing sex selection could lead to gender discrimination and a lack of diversity in society."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
","The opponents of the proposition that 'We should prohibit flag burning' argue that flag burning is a legitimate tool for expression, protest, and critique. They support this argument with evidence, including the case of Gregory Lee Johnson, who burned the American flag during a protest against the Reagan administration in 1984. Despite being convicted under a flag desecration law, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled in Johnson's favor, citing that his actions were protected by the First Amendment as a form of expression. Therefore, opponents argue that flag burning is justified under freedom of expression."

- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
",The debate topic is whether or not flag burning should be prohibited. Those who support the prohibition argue that flags are important symbols that deserve respect and that flag burning is an inflammatory act. The first argument is that flags should be respected as important symbols. The evidence supporting this argument is that Warren believed laws against flag-burning are constitutional. The second argument is that flag burning is an inflammatory act. The evidence supporting this argument is that proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed.
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
",The opponents of the statement 
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
","The debate topic is whether women should be prohibited from serving in combat roles. The supporters of the prohibition present several arguments to support their stance. 

Firstly, they argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women. They provide evidence that women are generally physically smaller and have less muscle density and bone mass than men. This makes it harder for them to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. The supporters also argue that even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent.

Secondly, they claim that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers that men can in combat roles. They provide evidence that the physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units.

Thirdly, supporters of the prohibition claim that women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. They provide evidence that men have emotions when they see a woman in harm's way, and it's very much in their culture to be protective. This can affect the performance of the military.

Fourthly, the supporters argue that women should serve in safer roles. They provide evidence that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support.

Lastly, they argue that women soldier capture is a big concern. They provide evidence that women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation, and stress, making them less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations.

In conclusion, the supporters of the prohibition argue that women should be prohibited from serving in combat roles due to their physical differences, inability to overcome barriers, potential distraction, safer roles availability, and capture concerns."

","The topic of debate is whether or not we should subsidize journalism. Those who support this idea argue that subsidies are important to make journalism viable, as it is becoming increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism. Additionally, journalism is important to information-spreading and accountability, as evidenced by the Associated Press' efficiency in producing accurate reporting. Subsidies can increase the quality of journalism through initiatives like the Ethical Journalism Initiative launched by the IFJ. Furthermore, subsidy can increase objectivity in reporting, exemplified by peace journalism which can help to expose violent groups' attempts to manipulate meaning for their own purposes."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,chatgpt,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.

    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
","The opponents of subsidizing space exploration argue that it is unnecessary and can be carried out by the private sector, citing the success of SpaceX in collaborating with NASA. They also highlight the high cost of space exploration and the limited scientific value of past and future missions.

This is supported by a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019. Secondly, they assert that vocational education better fits many students and provides relevant training and education that meets current workforce needs. This claim is supported by a study conducted by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in 2020. Thirdly, supporters argue that vocational education is a good career choice, with high demand for skilled workers in industries such as healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing. This claim is supported by a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022. Lastly, proponents of subsidizing vocational education claim that it is beneficial for the entire market and society by addressing workforce shortages in specific fields and industries. The National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium's study in 2019 also supports this claim."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
","The debate is centered around the topic of whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offense. Opponents of this stance argue that assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it and reduces suffering, as evidenced by the campaign group Dignity in Dying. They further argue that people should have the freedom to choose to end their life, as evidenced by plaintiffs who believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death. Additionally, opponents argue that the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide, as evidenced by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative. Overall, the opponents of this stance argue that assisted suicide should not be a criminal offense and should be considered a personal choice."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'. The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made..
- claim_3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dr. Lynda Young, MD, stated her opposition when she said, 'Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'.
- claim_4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
","The topic for the debate is whether 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence.' Those in support of this stance argue that assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die for their own benefit, violates the doctor's role as a healer, and people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others. Furthermore, people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. The evidence supporting these claims includes the requirements for a patient to be eligible for physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia, the opposition of the New Zealand Medical Association to voluntary euthanasia, and the statement of Dr. Lynda Young that assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as a healer. Additionally, it is argued that assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better and that allowing physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia could lead to non-voluntary euthanasia of vulnerable individuals."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
","The debate topic is whether homeschooling should be banned, and opponents argue against it. They have five main claims. The first claim is that homeschooling is often the best option for exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students. The Gallup polls conducted on American voters show that there has been a significant shift in attitude towards homeschooling over the past twenty years. The second claim is that homeschooling can be personalized to the child's pace and needs, whereas mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Many parents opt to homeschool their children due to unhappiness at school. The third claim is that mainstream schools have a lot of violence and bullying, whereas homeschools offer a safer environment for children. The fourth claim is that parents should have the right to choose the education of their children, and many parents prefer homeschooling over local public schools. The fifth claim is that the home is a good learning environment, where children can enjoy a broader socialization and have real opportunities to structure their own days. Overall, opponents argue that homeschooling should not be banned due to the benefits it provides to children and parents."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
","The debate topic is whether homeschooling should be banned, and the positive supporters argue in favor of a ban. They present four claims as evidence to support their stance. First, they argue that homeschooling cannot be regulated and standardized, which is essential to ensure that children are not being abused. Public schools, on the other hand, are a social safety net for vulnerable children, providing adequate nutrition and ensuring vaccination requirements. Second, mainstream schools are essential to developing social skills and exposure to community values. Third, mainstream schools offer a higher educational quality due to teachers being required to have education degrees and more experience working with children. Finally, parents are not qualified as teachers and cannot deliver the depth and breadth of learning that children require to meet their potential, which involves a lot of extra work and taking children to external examination centers. Therefore, the positive supporters argue that homeschooling should be banned."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as in the European Convention on Human Rights..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Mayo Clinic states that natural infection 'often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.'.
","The topic of the debate is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. The opponents of mandatory vaccinations present three claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that routine child vaccinations or their side effects are dangerous. To support this, they mention the example of Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, which was pulled from the market after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of bowel obstruction. Secondly, opponents of mandatory vaccinations claim that compulsory vaccination contradicts basic rights, including bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, opponents argue that routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy and that natural infection often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations, according to the Mayo Clinic."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..
","The debate topic is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. The supporters of this stance argue that routine child vaccinations are effective, save lives, necessary to protect others, prevent virus/disease spreading, and prevent children from suffering from preventable diseases. The evidence supporting these claims shows that the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine decreased invasive pneumococcal disease by 69%, the measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%, routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others as shown in the 2012 pertussis outbreak that sickened over 48,000 people, pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness, and vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases such as measles. Therefore, supporters argue that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to ensure the safety and well-being of children and the broader community."

- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..

- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.

","The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government, and its proponents have put forth several arguments to support the idea. First, they argue that social media regulation is necessary to protect younger audiences from harmful content. Second, they contend that it is necessary to combat the spread of fake news on social media. Third, they assert that social media regulation is beneficial to society at large. Fourth, they claim that it can help to deal with negative content on social media platforms. Finally, they argue that social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.

    - Evidence 1: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045). Simply living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, researchers suggest..

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
","The opponents of the proposition that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned put forward several arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God and dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbor. They also argue that celibacy is a strong religious belief and a privilege of the religious who have taken the vow of celibacy. Moreover, celibacy makes priests be perceived as holy. They further argue that priests choose to be celibate. Lastly, they argue that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, and removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.

","The debate topic is whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned. Supporters of this notion present several arguments to support their stance. First, they argue that celibacy is outdated, as evidenced by the belief of Lakeland that clerical celibacy should become optional and that change is inevitable. Second, they argue that celibacy is too pressuring and difficult, which has led to the suppression of urges and warped behaviour. Elizabeth Abbott, the author of A History of Celibacy, argues that celibacy has failed for thousands of years, bringing out horrible things. Third, supporters claim that celibacy is unhealthy and unnatural, as all living organisms are meant to reproduce, and the sexual act is critical for the survival of the species. Fourth, celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour, as seen in the wake of the clergy sexual abuse scandals, with critics arguing that priestly celibacy was a contributing factor. Finally, celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests, as evidenced by Gerard's complaint that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. Overall, supporters of abandoning the vow of celibacy present several compelling arguments to support their position."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
","The opponents of the proposition that we should abandon marriage have put forward five claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that marriage benefits children. Evidence shows that children who are raised in intact married families tend to have better outcomes in terms of education, health, and behavior. They are less likely to suffer abuse or engage in delinquent behavior. Secondly, opponents claim that marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons. Evidence shows that children who are raised in healthy marriages experience lasting benefits and are less likely to suffer from mental and behavioral disorders, criminal activity, and substance abuse. Thirdly, opponents argue that marriage makes people happy. Evidence shows that people who are happy with their lives are more likely to get married. Fourthly, they claim that marriage makes the couple closer. Evidence shows that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting. Finally, opponents claim that marriage provides important financial benefits, such as higher standard deductions and the ability to combine income. Overall, they believe that abandoning marriage would result in the loss of these important benefits."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
","The debate topic is about whether we should abandon marriage or not. The positive supporters argue that we should abandon marriage due to several reasons. First, marriage preserves norms that are harmful to women. Evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men, and the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women. Second, marriages are unstable, with around 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s getting divorced within 25 years. Third, marriages tie up people with unfair obligations, particularly women, who were historically and legally subordinate to their husbands. Finally, most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship. Monogamy fosters emotional intimacy, which supports two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. Therefore, the positive supporters believe that abandoning marriage would be a better option."

- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..
","The opponents argue that school uniforms should not be abandoned as they provide several benefits. Firstly, claim_1 states that children can still express themselves using other means as fashion is not considered free speech.

- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","The topic of the debate is whether we should abandon the use of school uniforms. The positive supporters of this argument have presented several claims to support their stance. The first claim is that school uniforms harm learning and creativity. This is supported by the statement of a senior, Alyse Madsen, who stated that strict dress codes infringe on a student's self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.

The second claim is that school uniforms are harming students' self-expression. This is supported by the evidence provided by Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, who states that wearing uniforms allows for a lot of comparison and that students often feel that they don't look their best if they have a different body type.

The third claim is that school uniforms are expensive. The Children's Society conducted research in 2020, which showed that the average spent on school uniforms per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable.

The fourth claim is that school uniforms are often uncomfortable and sexist. A recent GLSEN study found that 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender, and nearly 32 percent of transgender students have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex.

The fifth and final claim is that school uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality. Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. 

Overall, the evidence presented by the positive supporters of the argument to abandon school uniforms suggests that uniforms harm learning and creativity, self-expression, are expensive, uncomfortable/sexist, and increase conformity, or harm individuality."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","The opponents of abolishing capital punishment put forward three main claims. Firstly, they argue that the death penalty helps the victim and their family in finding closure, deterring other criminals and expressing society's moral outrage for the heinous crimes committed. They point to the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, a white supremacist who belonged to the Aryan People's Revolution, as an example of someone who deserved the ultimate punishment. Secondly, they claim that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, although the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights believes that it is contrary to customary international law to impose it on juveniles. Thirdly, they assert that capital punishment prevents crimes by serving as a deterrent, and cite a study by Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd which concludes that each execution results in eighteen fewer murders on average."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
","The debate topic is 'We should abolish capital punishment,' and its positive supporters present three main claims. First, state-sanctioned killing is fundamentally wrong. This claim is supported by evidence showing that the death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner, resulting in the execution of innocent people and racial bias in sentencing. Second, the death penalty harms the disenfranchised by diverting resources from other cases and costing taxpayers significantly more money. Third, the death penalty is irreversible, and its deterrent effect is debatable. Evidence indicates that fear of the death penalty may cause some to hesitate, but it is not enough to justify keeping it in force. Therefore, the supporters of abolishing capital punishment argue that it is an outdated and unjust practice that should be abolished."

Firstly, they claim that gun control is ineffective. They provide evidence from a Lancet study in 2016 which shows that most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and in some cases, such laws are associated with higher gun death rates. Secondly, opponents argue that gun ownership is a right and an essential component of personal freedom.

    - Evidence 1: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","The opponents of adopting an austerity regime argue that it should not be implemented due to several reasons. Firstly, it cuts access to essential services, as the unprotected areas such as social security, prisons, local government, and adult education are facing an annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Secondly, austerity extends recessions, as shown by the slow recovery in several European countries due to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates. Thirdly, austerity is unfair to citizens, causing rising inequality and poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements. Fourthly, austerity results in lower growth, as demonstrated by the OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. Lastly, austerity results in lower job creation, as austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation, according to Alessandro Turrini. Therefore, the opponents argue that adopting an austerity regime should be avoided due to the negative impacts it has on essential services, recessions, citizens, growth, and job creation."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
","The debate is about whether adopting an austerity regime is a good idea or not. The positive supporters argue that adopting an austerity regime is important for several reasons. Firstly, austerity improves economic measures as research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina showed that spending cuts were often associated with economic expansions. Secondly, austerity is important in the long term as cutting government consumption may raise the default premium in the short run but is necessary to maintain stability. Thirdly, austerity is important to increase stability as it allows for a growth in external demand to compensate for a contraction in internal demand. Fourthly, austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts, which is the plan of Chancellor George Osborne. Lastly, austerity regimes are essential in economically troubled times. A good example of successful austerity is the response of President Warren G. Harding who reduced federal budget and tax rates, which led to a drop in the debt by more than 30%. Overall, adopting an austerity regime is a necessary measure to ensure economic stability and reduce deficits in the long term."

","The debate topic is whether we should adopt atheism. Opponents of this view argue that adopting atheism is problematic for several reasons. Firstly, they claim that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. To support this claim, they provide evidence from the Albanian Constitution of 1976 and the penal code of 1977, which imposed prison sentences for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature. Secondly, opponents argue that atheism lacks morality. They cite Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, who argues that while atheists can behave morally, belief is necessary for an individual to give a rational and coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life. Lastly, opponents assert that people should be free to choose for themselves whether or not to adopt atheism. They provide evidence from the European Convention on Human Rights, which states that freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
","The debate topic is whether we should adopt atheism, and its supporters provide four main claims to support their stance. The first claim is that adopting atheism is beneficial to the person who adopts it since atheists do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion. The second claim is that atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists, and Atheist Michael Scriven insists that atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence.

We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
","The opponents of adopting libertarianism present several claims and evidence to support their arguments. First, they argue that libertarianism harms economic growth by ignoring market failures and that non-intervention in the economy leads to monopolies, stifled innovation, and economic instability. Second, they claim that libertarianism harms minorities and those who are worse off, as a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises requires endorsing the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Third, they argue that libertarianism is unjust and non-equal as markets can fail to address important social needs and result in unequal outcomes. Fourth, they claim that libertarianism removes essential laws, infrastructure, and government services, leaving no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion. Finally, they assert that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens and has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions."
We should adopt libertarianism,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism increases economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to freely associate with others, a libertarian system can promote greater cooperation, understanding, and social support. For example, sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
","The debate topic is whether we should adopt libertarianism, and the positive supporters argue that it should be adopted because it increases economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfillment, and individual freedom/liberties. The first argument in support of libertarianism is that it increases economic growth, and advocates of libertarianism suggest that reduced taxation leads to financial freedom and economic prosperity. The second argument is that libertarianism increases freedom in the political system by protecting property rights, which is essential for ensuring individual freedom. Thirdly, libertarianism promotes greater cooperation, understanding, and social support, leading to happiness and fulfillment. Lastly, libertarianism increases individual freedom and liberties through the principle of self-ownership. Rothbard's defense of self-ownership principle suggests that it is both axiomatic and universal. Therefore, the positive supporters of libertarianism argue that adopting libertarianism is beneficial for society as it brings economic growth, political freedom, happiness, and individual liberties."
We should ban human cloning,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Cloning can also be used to advance medical research in a number of different areas. For example, cloning can be used to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments for those diseases. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is free of genetic diseases that are present in one of the parents. A study by the New England Journal of Medicine found that cloning can help to reduce the transmission of genetic diseases..
- claim_3: Cloning promotes health.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of infertility and to develop new therapies to treat infertility. A study by the Fertility and Sterility journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the processes of reproduction..
- claim_4: Cloning promotes science/research.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, cloning can be used to study the genetic makeup of extinct species and to better understand the processes that led to their extinction. A study by the Journal of Evolutionary Biology found that cloning can help to better understand the process of evolution..
","The debate is about whether human cloning should be banned. Opponents argue against the ban of human cloning by stating that cloning can be used for organ replication and to advance medical research in various areas. Cloning can also be used to help people who cannot have a child due to genetic diseases, and it can be used to study the genetic basis of infertility. Additionally, cloning can promote science and research by studying the genetic makeup of extinct species and understanding the processes that led to their extinction. Therefore, banning human cloning could hinder scientific progress and limit medical advancements."

- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2001, when Germany and France proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an international convention to ban reproductive human cloning, the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included Spain, Philippines, the United States, and Costa Rica, noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report published by the Council of Europe in 2008 discussed the potential for abuse of cloning technology and recommended measures to ensure that cloning is used for medical purposes only..
","The debate topic is about banning human cloning. The positive supporters argue that human cloning should be banned based on four main claims. Firstly, cloning is not well understood enough, as it can lead to the dehumanization of children. Secondly, cloning is unethical and goes against religious beliefs. Thirdly, cloning is unnatural and disrupts the familial order. Finally, cloning is unsafe and has the potential for abuse, thus it should only be used for medical purposes. For instance, Germany and France proposed a convention to ban reproductive human cloning in 2001, while the Holy See noted that such a convention would legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning.

    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..
","The opponents of closing Guantanamo Bay detention camp make three claims. Firstly, they argue that closing the camp would harm national security, with evidence showing that a significant number of former detainees have reengaged in terrorist or insurgent activities after being transferred. Secondly, they claim that the camp is better for prisoners than alternatives, as it provides maximum security, multiple levels of confinement, and medical care. Finally, they argue that the camp is essential to gain intelligence, as key information used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained through enhanced interrogation techniques used on detainees at the camp."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
","The debate topic is whether the Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed. Those in favor of closing the camp argue that the detainees have the right to trial in US courts, as the US Supreme Court has ruled. They also argue that the camp harms the US image and institutions, serving as a symbol of discrimination and injustice, which has tarnished America's international reputation. Moreover, the camp is expensive, costing millions of dollars per prisoner, and personnel at the camp have committed crimes against the prisoners, such as physical abuse and torture. Finally, they argue that unjust treatment and tactics are used in the camp, citing examples of brutal treatment endured by Mr. Slahi and corroborated by investigations. All of these reasons support the conclusion that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed."
We should end affirmative action,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, the APALC submitted a brief supporting the University of Texas in preserving the use of affirmative action in admissions, saying Asian students 'benefited from exposure to a diverse student body.'.
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As historian Roger Wilkins has pointed out, Blacks have a 375-year history on this continent: 245 involving slavery, 100 involving legalized discrimination, and only 30 involving anything else (Wilkins, 1995). Jews and Asians, on the other hand, have immigrated to North America—often as doctors, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs, and so forth. Moreover, European Jews are able to function as part of the White majority. To expect Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians is to deny the historical and social reality that Black people face..

    - Evidence 1: Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals..
","The topic of the debate is whether affirmative action should be ended. Opponents of this idea argue that affirmative action is necessary to boost diversity, as evidenced by a brief submitted by the APALC in support of the University of Texas in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. They also argue that affirmative action is necessary to compensate for past discrimination against Black people, as evidenced by historian Roger Wilkins' research on Black history in North America. Lastly, opponents argue that affirmative action reduces discrimination, citing a 2001 case where Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers to counter past discriminatory policies against women and aboriginals."

    - Evidence 1: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
",The debate topic is whether we should end affirmative action or not. The supporters of this topic believe that affirmative action should be ended.

We should end mandatory retirement,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should end mandatory retirement', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: A mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019 found that mandatory retirement ages can stimulate economic growth, as younger workers are given more opportunities to enter the workforce and contribute to economic activity..
- claim_2: mandatory retirement age benefits those that are about to be retired.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can increase financial security for workers, as they can receive pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a specified age..
","The opponents of ending mandatory retirement argue that there are benefits to having a mandatory retirement age. First, they claim that mandatory retirement creates opportunities for younger workers to enter the workforce and contribute to economic growth. This claim is supported by a 2019 study by the International Monetary Fund which found that mandatory retirement ages can stimulate economic growth. Second, they argue that mandatory retirement benefits those who are about to retire by providing them with increased financial security through pension and retirement benefits at a specified age. This argument is supported by a 2010 report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Therefore, opponents believe that ending mandatory retirement may have negative consequences for both younger workers and those who are approaching retirement."
We should end mandatory retirement,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should end mandatory retirement', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: A mandatory retirement age decreases institutional knowledge.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Commercial airline pilots in the United States have a mandatory retirement age of 65, having increased from age 60 in 2007 [REF]..
- claim_2: A mandatory retirement age harms the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019 found that mandatory retirement ages can limit labor market flexibility, as older workers are forced to retire, reducing the flexibility of the workforce and limiting the ability of employers to respond to changing economic conditions..
- claim_3: A mandatory retirement is not fair/discriminatory.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that mandatory retirement ages can promote intergenerational inequity, as older workers are forced to retire, reducing the diversity of skills and experiences available in the workplace and limiting opportunities for intergenerational collaboration..
- claim_4: A mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The Impact of Mandatory Retirement on Social Connections and Loneliness by Linda George, published in The Gerontologist, found that mandatory retirement can lead to decreased social connections and increased feelings of loneliness, both of which can negatively impact quality of life..
- claim_5: We should let everyone retire when they are ready.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready can reduce the risk of poverty in old age, as older workers can continue to earn an income, reducing their dependence on social security and pension benefits..
","The supporters of ending mandatory retirement argue that it should be abolished due to its harmful effects. Firstly, mandatory retirement decreases institutional knowledge which is evident in the airline industry where pilots are forced to retire at a certain age. Secondly, it harms the economy as it limits labor market flexibility, reducing the workforce's ability to adapt to changing economic conditions. Thirdly, mandatory retirement is discriminatory, promoting intergenerational inequity by reducing the diversity of skills and experiences available in the workplace. Fourthly, it reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, causing decreased social connections and increased feelings of loneliness. Finally, they argue that people should be allowed to retire when they are ready, which can reduce the risk of poverty in old age as they can continue to earn an income. Therefore, the supporters believe that mandatory retirement should be abolished to prevent these negative consequences."

","As opponents of the abolition of nuclear weapons, the claim is made that these weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. The evidence supporting this claim is that deterrence has been a strategy used for almost 70 years to prevent certain actions and has been critical in maintaining peace."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
","The debate topic is about whether we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. The supporters of this stance argue that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands, causing a significant threat. They provide evidence that nuclear materials are not going away and that more states are interested in developing them, which could lead to theft or loss of these materials. They also argue that the use of nuclear weapons could escalate a disastrous military action, citing the Cuban missile crisis as an example. They believe that when tensions escalate, it becomes more likely that unfortunate coincidences could lead to big problems, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would survive a similar flare-up in tensions. Therefore, they conclude that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons to prevent these potential threats."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
","The proponents of urbanization argue against the statement that 'We should fight urbanization' with three main claims. Firstly, they claim that cities offer more opportunities for better jobs and education, as evidenced by the migration trend in Japan during its economic development. Secondly, urbanization benefits the economy by promoting economic growth, technological advancements, occupational and social mobility, and adaptability. Thirdly, urbanization benefits the environment by driving innovation, including the development of green technologies, which will determine the future of the green economy. Thus, they contend that urbanization should not be fought but rather embraced for its numerous benefits."

- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and good-quality touristic services, so the fast process of urbanization, had the consequence of irregular neighbourhoods..
","The debate topic is 'We should fight urbanization', and those who support this notion argue for it based on several claims. Firstly, they claim that restrictions on migration would benefit people in rural areas economically and socially. Evidence to support this includes the protection of natural resources, which eliminates income risk and health effects that facilitate rural to urban migration. Secondly, they argue that urbanization causes crime, and evidence shows that the crime rate rose during the period of industrialization, particularly in towns and cities. Thirdly, they argue that urbanization harms the environment, with surveys showing that urbanization and coastal development contribute to increased degradation of the marine environment. Finally, they claim that urbanization strains the resources of cities, with the fast process of urbanization resulting in irregular neighborhoods. Based on these arguments and evidence, the proponents of fighting urbanization suggest that we need to take action to restrict urbanization."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
- claim_4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..
","The opponents of introducing compulsory voting present several claims. Firstly, they argue that abstaining from voting is a way of reflecting one's preferences and that forcing individuals to vote goes against this. The evidence supporting this claim comes from Herbert Spencer, who noted that regardless of whether a person votes or not, they will be deemed to have consented to the winning candidate's rule. Secondly, the opponents argue that citizens have the right not to vote, and compulsory voting would be a fundamental breach of civil liberties. This claim is supported by the stance of right faction leader Minchin in the Liberal Party, who supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system. Thirdly, the opponents claim that compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, which may skew election results. This claim is supported by the argument that people who are uninformed or do not care about the election outcome may end up voting randomly. Finally, opponents claim that not everyone has the ability to go to vote, and some may vote based on intentional disinformation. The evidence supporting this claim comes from a recent poll that showed most Americans don't know basic facts about the Constitution, and some may be voting based on intentional disinformation."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
","The topic of the debate is whether or not to introduce compulsory voting. Supporters of the proposition argue that it should be introduced for three main reasons. Firstly, it increases representation, as candidates would have to address the needs of all voters if voting were compulsory. This is in contrast to voluntary voting systems, where less educated and poorer people tend not to vote, skewing the political system towards the well-off and educated. Secondly, compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. By ensuring that candidates win a majority of the people's votes, the legitimacy of elected representatives will be increased. Finally, people have an obligation to vote. This is evidenced by the fact that voter turnout in Thailand is not much of a problem as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the constitution."

    - Evidence 1: For example, the Board representative is quoted as having said that we might end up in the next 10 or 20 years with our psychiatric hospitals filled with people who have problems with cannabis, and that a recent study by the British Lung Foundation found smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:

- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
- claim_5: Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Take California for example: first in the nation to legalize the medical use of the drug in 1996, the state would go on to legalize recreational use in 2016. But in just the past year, the state reported several massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza – just over the last three or four months..
","The opponents of legalizing cannabis argue that it harms the body, increases lack of judgment and accidents, is a gateway drug, can get into the hands of underage teenagers, and boosts the black market and criminal activity. They provide evidence to support their claims, such as a recent study by the British Lung Foundation which found that smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes. Researchers also found that the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9% to 21.5% from 2000 to 2018, and that early cannabis smokers were five times more likely to move on to harder drugs.

- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..

    - Evidence 1: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence..
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..
","The topic of the debate is whether prostitution should be legalized. Those who oppose the legalization of prostitution argue that it will lead to several negative consequences. Firstly, legalization will increase the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, as prostitution can act as a reservoir of STDs within the general population, as evidenced by studies in developing countries such as Kenya. Secondly, legalizing prostitution will lead to increased involvement in immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking, as substantiated by research conducted by Maxwell and others, who found a strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes. Thirdly, legalizing prostitution will lead to increased violence against women, as research conducted by Giobbe found similarities in the behavior of pimps and batterers, particularly through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence. Lastly, opponents argue that selling one's body is immoral and violates feminist principles. They argue that prostitution is a form of male dominance over women, which reduces them to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client, and is not a mutual and equal sex act."

    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..
","The debate centers around the legalization of prostitution, and its positive supporters argue that it should be legalized for several reasons. Firstly, legalizing prostitution would boost the economy, as it has been historically shown to be a functional part of the economy, with well-run prostitution providing revenue. Secondly, it would increase benefits for sex workers such as health care and unionization, as seen in the example of the Ministry of Justice considering legalizing prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income. Thirdly, legalizing prostitution would allow for regulation of the profession, making it safer and more secure for sex workers. Fourthly, it would make the profession safer for women, as interventions to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases can be launched. Finally, supporters of legalizing prostitution argue that it is a valid choice over one's own body, as sex work can be viewed as a profession or a way of making money, and is not inherently bad unless it is done against one's will."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
","The opponents of legalizing sex selection argue that it can lead to gender imbalance as seen today with around 140 million missing women in the world due to son preference and gender-biased sex selection.

    - Evidence 1: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
","The debate topic is whether sex selection should be legalized. Those who support the legalization of sex selection provide several arguments. Firstly, they argue that selecting the sex of the child is within the freedom of the parents. It allows them to plan for their family, ensuring an adequate number of children that they can raise and provide good education and proper nutrition for. Secondly, sex selection allows for better family planning, especially in countries like China where couples are only allowed to have one or two children, and gender selection gives parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father's family name. Thirdly, sex selection makes the family happier and more complete as parents may have a preference for a baby of a certain gender. Fourthly, sex selection prevents diseases in the child by potentially allowing the selection of embryos without genetic disorders, matching a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, and decreasing cancer predisposition. Lastly, sex selection can prevent abortions and infanticide, which is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females.

- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
","The debate revolves around the topic of prohibiting flag burning. Opponents of this idea argue that flag burning is an effective tool of expression, protest, and critique. They support their argument by citing the case of Miller's attorney, who argued that burning a draft card is a form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible. This means that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment, and flag burning falls under this category. 

Furthermore, opponents also argue that flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression. They cite the fact that the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable. While flag desecration may be offensive to some, the expression of an idea must be protected by the government. 

In summary, opponents of the idea to prohibit flag burning argue that it is a form of expression protected by the First Amendment, and the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because it is offensive to some."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions.

- claim_2: It is preferable to spend the money elsewhere.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Postal subsidies from our nation’s early founding (cited as a precedent by Downie/Schudson and McChesney/Nichols) are irrelevant. We had one communication medium then, newspapers. In today’s world of multiple forms of print, broadcast and digital communication, federal subsidies would decide winners and losers, protecting inefficient companies and creating huge obstacles for entrepreneurs..
- claim_3: Journalism is like every other business and if it is not sustainable it should fail.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The federal government can’t afford to bail out newspapers. Have you been paying attention? The feds already bailed out undeserving banks and automobile manufacturers and are trying to figure out how to fix our health-care system. The taxpayers can’t afford to bail out undeserving media companies and journalism can’t afford to be dependent on a debt-burdened government..
","The opponents of the proposition that 'we should subsidize journalism' put forth three main arguments. Firstly, they argue that government intervention in journalism carries the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. This is because if the government funds journalism, they will regulate it, which could impinge upon the freedom of the press. Evidence cited in support of this includes the fact that freedom of the press has to include the freedom for the press to fail. 

Secondly, they contend that it is preferable to spend money elsewhere. They argue that postal subsidies from the past, which have been cited as a precedent for this proposal, are irrelevant as they were created in a time when there was only one medium of communication, newspapers. In contrast, today's media landscape consists of multiple forms of print, broadcast, and digital communication, and federal subsidies would be a hindrance to entrepreneurs and protect inefficient companies, resulting in winners and losers being chosen.

Lastly, they argue that journalism is like every other business and if it is not sustainable, it should fail. The federal government cannot afford to bail out newspapers and the taxpayers cannot afford to bail out undeserving media companies. Evidence cited to support this includes the fact that the federal government has already bailed out undeserving banks and automobile manufacturers and is grappling with fixing the healthcare system, leaving no room to rescue the journalism industry."

","The debate topic is whether or not we should subsidize journalism. Those in favor of subsidizing journalism have put forth several claims to support their stance. 

Firstly, they argue that a subsidy is crucial for the financial viability of journalism. This is especially important in times of crisis, such as during the pandemic, where advertising revenues have decreased significantly. 

Secondly, supporters of subsidizing journalism argue that journalism is important for spreading information and promoting accountability. They cite a report that states that mainstream media is essential to topical social media conversations in the UK. 

Thirdly, it is argued that subsidies will increase the quality of journalism. By providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against powerful incumbents. This will introduce voters to different ideas and highlight conflicting opinions, which will facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news. 

Lastly, supporters argue that subsidies increase objectivity in reporting. Peace journalism is cited as an example of how presenting anomalous local perspectives that contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism can help expose violent groups' attempts to promote their violence. 

In summary, those in favor of subsidizing journalism argue that it is crucial for the financial viability of journalism, important for spreading information and promoting accountability, increases the quality of journalism, and increases objectivity in reporting."

Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..
","The opponents argue that we should not subsidize space exploration because it can be carried out by the private sector. Evidence suggests that in recent years, NASA has partnered with private, for-profit rocket companies like Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX, which hope to expand space exploration at a rapid rate. They also claim that space exploration is expensive and can cost billions of dollars. Furthermore, it is ineffective and responsible for large amounts of pollution. Lastly, there are other issues that need funding, and the $19.3 billion annual budget for space exploration could be used to pay for education, healthcare, or to fund other important programs."

    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..

This suggests that subsidies for vocational education can influence student choice and lead to an influx in those fields..
- claim_4: vocational education is not a good career choice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience..
","The opponents of the idea of subsidizing vocational education have made several claims. Firstly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes. They cite a report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019, which found that many vocational education programs may not provide the skills and knowledge that workers need to succeed in the 21st century, and therefore may have limited benefits for the economy.

Secondly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education is expensive, and can be limited by the ability to scale, as many programs may not have the resources or infrastructure to serve large numbers of students. They cite a study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020, which supports this claim.

Thirdly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions. They point to a study that analyzed the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany and found that the subsidies led to an increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs, suggesting that subsidies for vocational education can influence student choice and lead to an influx in those fields.

Finally, opponents of vocational education claim that vocational education is not a good career choice as many programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience. The evidence cited in support of this claim is the same report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019."
We should subsidize vocational education,1.0,chatgpt,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize vocational education', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:

- claim_2: vocational education better fits many students.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that vocational education programs often offer customized learning experiences tailored to the individual needs and interests of students, which can better fit the learning styles of many students compared to traditional academic programs..
- claim_3: vocational education is a good career choice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that individuals with vocational education often have shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education..
- claim_4: vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that vocational education programs can promote workforce diversity by providing training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by increasing the representation of diverse individuals in the workforce..
","The debate topic is whether we should subsidize vocational education or not. The positive supporters of the statement argue that we should subsidize vocational education. They have presented four claims to support their stance. Firstly, subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources. A study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education can increase economic mobility, particularly for individuals who may not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education or who face barriers to employment. Secondly, vocational education better fits many students. According to a report by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019, vocational education programs often offer customized learning experiences tailored to the individual needs and interests of students, which can better fit the learning styles of many students compared to traditional academic programs. Thirdly, vocational education is a good career choice. A report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that individuals with vocational education often have a shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education. Finally, vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society.

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 2: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
    - Evidence 2: In 2002, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide. This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
    - Evidence 2: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
","The debate is about whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offense or not. Opponents of this view argue that assisted suicide provides dignity to the person who wants to commit it. They state that it reduces suffering and that people should have the freedom to choose to end their life. Furthermore, the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide. Evidence supporting these claims includes the fact that the concept of dignity suits the intuitions that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death. In addition, studies from parts of the world that have legalized assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally. The opponents also argue that physician-assisted suicide knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Furthermore, they argue that in some cases not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide. Overall, opponents of the view that assisted suicide should be a criminal offense believe that it is a fundamental right for terminally ill patients to choose when and how they end their lives."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text..
    - Evidence 2: The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient..
- claim_2: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: In 1997, in the cases of Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it..
- claim_3: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
    - Evidence 2: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
","The debate topic is whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offence. Supporters of the criminalization of assisted suicide make three main claims. Firstly, they argue that assisted suicide violates the role of doctors. This is supported by evidence from the organization which argues that making doctors the agents of a patient's death outweighs any advantages of assisted suicide. Additionally, the State of New York has enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide. Secondly, they claim that people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others. Evidence for this claim comes from the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it. Thirdly, they argue that people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help. This is supported by the slippery slope argument which claims that accepting certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable. Additionally, studies in the Netherlands fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to nonvoluntary euthanasia of vulnerable groups such as children, the demented, the mentally ill, and the elderly."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The agency provides Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
    - Evidence 2: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
    - Evidence 2: Unschoolers cite studies which report that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers, and some believe this is a result of the wide range of people with which they have the opportunity to communicate..
","The opponents of the ban on homeschooling argue that it should not be banned because it is the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional, religious, ill, and disabled students. Homeschooling can also be personalized to the child's pace and needs, which allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people. Furthermore, mainstream schools have a lot of violence and bullying, which homeschooling can protect children from. Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children because they want to have a deeper understanding of their children's education progress, give their children the liberty to explore their own family's culture, and take direct responsibility for their children's education. Finally, the home is a good learning environment that can provide real opportunities for children to structure their own days, enjoy a broader socialization, and become more mature than their schooled peers."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 2: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 2: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 2: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
","The debate revolves around whether homeschooling should be banned or not. Supporters of the ban argue that homeschooling cannot be standardized, as there is a lack of regulation in some areas, which can lead to poor-quality education. Mainstream schools are considered essential to develop social skills, as homeschooling deprives children of work experience opportunities, sports leagues, and recognition and reward. The National Education Association and the European Court of Human Rights oppose homeschooling, citing the potential for a one-sided point of view and the need for regulation. Moreover, parents are not qualified as teachers, and it requires a significant amount of time and energy to ensure that children's educational needs are met."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
    - Evidence 2: The CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, and a “small possibility” exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disorder in which the person’s immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system, in about one or two per million people vaccinated..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'.
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as in the European Convention on Human Rights..
","The opponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations argue that they are dangerous and can have negative side effects. For example, the rotavirus vaccine was pulled from the market after it was discovered that it could cause bowel obstruction, and there are reports of pneumonia being caused by the chickenpox vaccine. Additionally, mandatory vaccination is seen as a contradiction of basic rights. The First Amendment of the US Constitution prohibits the government from interfering with the free exercise of religion, which could include not getting vaccinated for religious reasons. Furthermore, mandatory vaccination is seen as an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
    - Evidence 2: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 2: The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that vaccination prevents 3.5–5 million deaths per year, and up to 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination.
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 2: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
    - Evidence 2: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
","The debate topic is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. The supporters of mandatory vaccinations present five claims with evidence to support them. Firstly, they argue that routine child vaccinations are effective in preventing diseases such as pneumococcal and polio. Secondly, they claim that vaccinations save lives by preventing infections and deaths from diseases. Thirdly, mandatory vaccinations are necessary to protect others, as unvaccinated individuals can spread diseases to those who cannot receive vaccinations. Fourthly, mandatory vaccinations prevent the spread of viruses and diseases, as shown by the eradication of smallpox and the effectiveness of pertussis vaccines. Finally, children should not suffer from preventable diseases, and vaccine hesitancy can result in disease outbreaks and deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Based on these claims and evidence, the supporters of mandatory vaccinations believe that it is necessary to make routine child vaccinations mandatory."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
    - Evidence 2: The groups wrote that, 'The FTC’s failure to enforce its order has resulted in the unlawful transfer of [87] million user records … [i]t is unconscionable that the FTC allowed this unprecedented disclosure of Americans’ personal data to occur. The FTC’s failure to act imperils not only privacy but democracy as well.'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
    - Evidence 2: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
    - Evidence 2: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
    - Evidence 2: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
    - Evidence 2: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..
","The opponents of the proposition that social media platforms should be regulated by the government argue that social media regulation is not effective. They cite examples of landmark legislation, such as the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, and G.D.P.R., which have had little impact on data-collection practices by Facebook, Google and others. They also argue that regulation harms privacy and leads to government intervention that can threaten freedom of speech and other democratic rights. Furthermore, they assert that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, and that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government. For instance, political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom have suppressed voting and political participation, polarising voters, lowering trust in institutions, and degrading the quality of democracy."

We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.

- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 2: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.

    - Evidence 1: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 2: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
","The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. Those who support social media regulation have put forth the following claims and evidence: 

Firstly, social media regulation protects younger audiences. Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. 

Secondly, social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news. The European Union reached a deal on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation. 

Thirdly, social media regulation is beneficial to society at large. The proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms. The UK government is leading the way in tackling online harm with the forthcoming legislation, making social platforms safer by design. 

Fourthly, social media regulation can help to deal with negative content. The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. 

Lastly, social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users. The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things. 

In summary, social media regulation is supported by those who believe that it can protect younger audiences, deal with fake news, benefit society at large, help to deal with negative content, and deal with malicious users."

    - Evidence 2: In another study, it was found that white teachers were more likely to give constructive feedback on essays if they believed the student who wrote it was white. Essays perceived to be written by Black or Latino students were given more praise and less guidance on how to improve their writing..
- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
    - Evidence 2: The 2020 presidential election further highlighted these deep-seated divides. Supporters of Biden and Donald Trump believe the differences between them are about more than just politics and policies..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
    - Evidence 2: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..

- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..
    - Evidence 2: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..

    - Evidence 2: A range of scholars from at least the late 19th century to the present have produced arguments that white supremacy exists in U.S. school curriculum, oftentimes to the detriment of non-White students Americans' learning outcomes and the whole of American society..
","The opponents of the claim that 'The USA is a good country to live in' have presented several arguments. Firstly, they argue that the US has unfair health and education policies, citing evidence that black and Hispanic adults face more difficulty affording healthcare costs, and that white teachers give more constructive feedback to white students than to Black or Latino students. Secondly, they argue that the US has a problematic and divisive political system, with increasing divisions between the two parties based on various identities. Thirdly, they argue that the US has a negative culture, characterized by misuse of technology, sexual immorality, video game violence, and little respect for one another. Fourthly, they argue that the US has high taxation and a high cost of living, citing evidence that a struggling family in Manhattan is taxed at a higher rate than a family with the same standard of living in Atlanta. Fifthly, they argue that the US has inequality and poverty, with evidence showing that a disproportionate number of homeless people are male, black, middle-aged, veterans, and disabled. Sixthly, they argue that the US is unsafe, with evidence showing that many people are worried about violent crime and feel less safe than they did five years ago. Lastly, they argue that the US is xenophobic and racist, citing evidence of hate crimes against Asian Americans and arguments that white supremacy exists in US school curriculum.

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 2: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 2: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 2: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
    - Evidence 2: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 2: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
    - Evidence 2: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
","The opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy argue that it allows priests to focus on God and their spiritual life without being distracted by other obligations. They cite evidence from Paul VI and early Christian theologian Origen that supports the concept of celibacy as a strong religious belief and a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ. Additionally, they claim that celibacy makes priests appear more holy to the public and that it is a voluntary choice made by those who take the vows of celibacy, obedience, and poverty. The opponents argue that maintaining religious traditions and experiences is important, and that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts. They support their argument with evidence of the recent sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church and the findings of the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia that “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”."
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)..
    - Evidence 2: George T. Dennis SJ of Catholic University of America says: 'There is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.' Peter Fink SJ agrees, saying that underlying premises used in the book, Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy, 'would not stand up so comfortably to historical scrutiny'. Dennis says this book provides no evidence that celibacy had apostolic origins..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
    - Evidence 2: Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
    - Evidence 2: Ignoring his vow of celibacy, Urbain Grandier is known to have had sexual relationships with a number of women and to have acquired a reputation as a philanderer..
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
    - Evidence 2: In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy..
","The debate topic is whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned or not. The positive supporters argue that celibacy should be abandoned because it is outdated, too pressuring and difficult, unhealthy and unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behavior, and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. The first argument is supported by evidence stating that the vow of celibacy had been changed to one of conjugal fidelity by Pope Paul III in 1540, and there is no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice of priestly celibacy before the fourth century. The second argument is supported by evidence stating that celibacy is challenging because of sexual chemistry, and it can lead to hardship and loneliness. The third argument is supported by evidence stating that celibacy is an unnatural act in nature and can cause depression and conflict. The fourth argument is supported by evidence stating that ignoring the vow of celibacy can lead to sexual abuse and a bad reputation for the clergy. The fifth argument is supported by evidence stating that ending celibacy could address the priest shortage and increase the number of people who want to become priests."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
    - Evidence 2: Moreover, a 2010 CDC study on child well-being and family structure shows that children from homes with married parents did better in every category..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 2: But while cohabitation is on the rise, data from Pew and other sources continue to show that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships. The marriage happiness premium extends to nearly every aspect of a couple's relationship, with one notable exception: their sex lives..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 2: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult. About eight-in-ten married adults (78%) say they feel closer to their spouse than to any other adult in their life; a narrower majority of cohabiters (55%) say the same about their partner..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
    - Evidence 2: One of the most significant advantages of marriage is eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits. First, as a married couple, you're each eligible to collect your own Social Security benefit or up to 50 percent of your spouse's benefit, whichever is greater. This can be a financial plus if one of you is a higher earner..

We should abandon marriage,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
    - Evidence 2: Millions of girls around the world experience female genital mutilation (FGM) as a prerequisite to marriage or as a means to control a woman’s sexuality before marriage. This is an infringement on a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy, and as it is often performed on school-aged girls, also stops them from being able to access education and deprives them of their childhood, as well as causing both short- and long-term health consequences..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 2: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","The supporters of the idea that we should abandon marriage argue that the preservation of norms within marriage is harmful to women. This is evidenced by the fact that women are expected to be submissive to male family members, including their husbands, and face physical violence if they do not comply. Additionally, millions of girls undergo female genital mutilation as a prerequisite to marriage or to control their sexuality. Marriages are also unstable, as divorce rates have increased globally since the 1970s due to changes in expectations within marriages, particularly as more women entered the workforce. Marriages also tie people up with unfair obligations, such as Qatar's laws that require women to have male guardian permission to marry and lose their right to financial support if they are deemed "

  Evidence supporting claim_2:

    - Evidence 2: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 2: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
    - Evidence 2: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
","The opponents of abandoning school uniform argue that it has several benefits. Firstly, children can still express themselves using other means such as buttons or jewelry, according to a former student at Hershey High School and research published by Andrea Dashiell. Secondly, school uniforms reduce bullying, as found by the Department of Education and a study commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award. Thirdly, school uniforms create a sense of equality and unity among students, according to a Texas survey and the belief of 89% of teachers. Fourthly, school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning, as students in uniform are more focused on their academics, according to Natasha Irshad. Finally, school uniforms save costs for families, as one year of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150 compared to an average of $300 per child for back-to-school clothing, according to a NY Post article."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
    - Evidence 2: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 2: Based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
    - Evidence 2: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
    - Evidence 2: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
    - Evidence 2: This idea is supported by testimony from a 17-year-old student forced to wear uniforms. Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
","The debate topic is whether we should abandon the use of school uniform. Those who support abandoning the use of school uniform argue that school uniform harms learning and creativity, harms student self-expression, is expensive, often uncomfortable and sexist, and increases conformity or harms individuality. 

They provide evidence to support each of these claims. For example, studies have shown that school uniforms can have a negative impact on students' creativity and self-expression. Furthermore, they argue that school uniforms are often expensive and can be uncomfortable or even sexist. Finally, they argue that school uniforms increase conformity and harm individuality.

Overall, those who argue that we should abandon the use of school uniform believe that the negative impact of school uniforms outweighs any potential benefits, and that students would be better served by being able to express themselves freely through their clothing choices."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
    - Evidence 2: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
    - Evidence 2: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as deliberate and systematic .. extrajudicial killings, and has condemned them as crimes against humanity..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 2: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","The opponents of abolishing capital punishment argue that it should remain in place for several reasons. Firstly, they claim that the death penalty brings closure and justice to victims' families, as well as expressing the moral outrage of society towards the most heinous crimes. This is supported by the statements of Henry McMaster and Leslie Rutledge, who believe that capital punishment can deter other would-be murderers and prevent further crimes. Secondly, they argue that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, despite the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintaining that it is contrary to customary international law. Finally, they claim that the death penalty prevents crimes, citing studies that show a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates, as well as a deterrent effect. This is supported by the research of David Muhlhausen and Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 2: In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime..
","The supporters of abolishing capital punishment argue that it is fundamentally wrong for the state to sanction killing, and provide evidence to support their claims. They argue that the death penalty is often applied in an unjust and discriminatory manner, with people of color being more likely to be executed than white people, and innocent people are too often sentenced to death. Additionally, the death penalty harms the disenfranchised by diverting resources from other cases and is a waste of taxpayer funds, with no public safety benefit. Finally, the death penalty is irreversible, and there is no evidence to suggest that it serves as a deterrent to serious crime. Therefore, it is time for all nations, including the United States, to abolish capital punishment."
We should abolish intellectual property rights,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish intellectual property rights', Its opponents argue that:

    - Evidence 1: By codifying intellectual property for plant breeders, UPOV aims to encourage the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society..
    - Evidence 2: Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) was a strong supporter of these committees, which aimed to further support the goals of the PRO-IP Act, centered upon protecting American intellectual property and in turn, protect innovation central to the U.S. economy and its job market..
- claim_2: Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Many economists believe that, in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced, because there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organisations to produce them.

    - Evidence 2: These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs..
","The opponents argue against the abolition of intellectual property rights, stating that they incentivize creativity, innovation, investment in new products, and protect against stealing. They provide evidence to support their claims, such as UPOV's encouragement of plant breeders to develop new plant varieties, the PRO-IP Act's protection of American intellectual property to benefit the US economy and job market, and the Business Software Alliance's claim that public opinion supports paying innovators for their technological advances. The opponents also argue that intellectual property rights protect against stealing, as stated by Senator Leahy and evidenced by the NIPRCC's initiative to hinder intellectual property violations on the internet. Finally, they argue that people or businesses own their innovations and should be able to be compensated for their endeavors, with examples such as IPRs being essential to implement worldwide standards and providing a financial incentive for the creation and investment in intellectual property."

    - Evidence 1: By 1852, many in the photographic community felt that Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property were hampering the development of photography in England and had called upon him to relinquish his patent..
    - Evidence 2: Murray Rothbard argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain..
- claim_5: Intellectual property rights waste money.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For getting the protection for the first time, it could be bit expensive particularly if the product is complex and involves methods, designs, and processes..
    - Evidence 2: Boldrin and Levine argue that government does not ordinarily enforce monopolies for producers of other goods. This is because it is widely recognized that monopoly creates many social costs. Intellectual monopoly is no different in this respect..

","The debate is about whether intellectual property rights should be abolished. The supporters of this stance argue that intellectual property hinders the continuous improvement of a service/product, restricts access to important information/products, is unfair, harms creativity/innovation, wastes money, and is ineffective. They provide evidence such as the case of Fox Talbot's patent in photography, the negative impact of intellectual monopolies on health and progress, the compromised process of making laws that benefits multinational corporations, the recognition of the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples, the iniquitous nature of Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights, the weakness of natural rights arguments for intellectual property, the ability of intellectual property laws to hinder innovation, and the high cost of protection. They also argue that intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state. They conclude that intellectual property rights should be abolished to promote free exchange of ideas and prevent social costs."
We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Gun control is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws.  A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
    - Evidence 2: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, 'The right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life'..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment..
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
    - Evidence 2: Journalist John Stossel explained, “Criminals don’t obey the law… Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job… As the saying goes, ‘If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'”.
","The opponents of the proposition 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms' argue that gun control is ineffective because criminals predominantly obtain firearms illegally, and state and federal laws are not a deterrent. Furthermore, they assert that gun ownership is a right established by the Second Amendment and a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life. They also argue that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports-shooting, and promotes self-protection. These claims are supported by evidence such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics report, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, and Gallup survey data."

    - Evidence 1: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and “89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence.”.
","The topic of debate is whether or not we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. Those who support the motion argue that banning guns would save lives, as shown by evidence such as a study published in the American Journal of Public Health that found a long-lasting increased risk of violent death associated with legal purchase of a handgun. Additionally, Harvard professor David Hemenway's research indicates that there are more homicides in developed countries where guns are more available. Supporters of the motion also argue that gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence, supported by evidence such as a 1993 study in The New England Journal of Medicine that found guns kept in the home increased the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance. Furthermore, a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10-unit increase in permissiveness over five years. Guns can also fall into the wrong hands, leading to tragic incidents, as shown by the Sutherland Springs, Texas church massacre, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns. Finally, guns lead to accidental deaths, particularly among children and adolescents due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms. Evidence from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance indicates that states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths, and 89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents' absence."

- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
    - Evidence 2: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
","The opponents of adopting an austerity regime argue that it is not a viable option. Firstly, austerity cuts access to essential services such as local authorities and public health grants, resulting in the destruction of a safety net built over many years, and leaving few public services unscathed. Secondly, austerity extends recessions and worsens the ongoing economic crisis, as experienced in Argentina, Russia, and Turkey. Thirdly, austerity is unfair to the citizens as it is a political choice that results in high levels of child poverty and violates human rights. Fourthly, austerity results in lower growth and undermines public finances and tax revenues. Finally, austerity results in lower job creation, as countries with more regulated labor markets have far lower job creation levels. Therefore, adopting an austerity regime is not recommended."

- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 2: For example, Canada in 1993-96, cut their fiscal deficit but maintained strong economic growth..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 2: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
    - Evidence 2: Countries use austerity measures to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. That's when creditors become concerned that the country will default on its debt. It occurs when the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is greater than 77%..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 2: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
","The debate topic is about adopting an austerity regime, and the positive supporters have presented five claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that austerity improves economic measures and provide evidence from Latvia and Estonia showing that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. Secondly, they argue that austerity is important in the long term, and cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. The EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. Thirdly, they argue that austerity is important to increase stability, and Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s, but austerity measures and pro-market reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment.

We should adopt atheism,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: John Locke in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos..
    - Evidence 2: As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film The Golden Compass, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be watered down from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says denigrates Christianity and promotes atheism for kids, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief..
- claim_2: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..
","The opponents of adopting atheism present two main arguments. Firstly, they claim that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. This is supported by evidence such as John Locke's belief that atheism would undermine social order and lead to chaos, as well as a protest campaign against a film that promotes atheism. Secondly, they argue that people should choose for themselves whether atheism should be adopted. This is supported by evidence such as the belief that choosing to believe in God or not is a personal choice without scientific proof either way, and the European Court of Human Rights finding that people cannot be forced to demonstrate views associated with a particular religion."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: La Mettrie defended a purely pleasure-based view of the proper end of human life, and advocated atheism as the only means of liberating human beings from the various forms of oppression which stand in the way of human progress..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
","The debate is centered around the adoption of atheism. The positive supporters argue that we should adopt atheism because it is beneficial to the person that adopts it. Atheism provides a superior basis for ethics, making atheists more inclined to evaluate the morality of imperatives themselves. Atheism also liberates human beings from various forms of oppression, which stand in the way of human progress. Additionally, we should adopt atheism because we cannot prove that God exists. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence. Belief in what is inherently unobservable is irrational, making the "
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 2: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 2: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
","The opponents of adopting libertarianism present several compelling claims against it. Firstly, they argue that libertarianism harms economic growth, as demonstrated by the failure of Northern Rock, which was connected to Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy. Additionally, poorly constructed government regulation can do more harm than good by increasing inequality, as argued by Steven Teles and Brink Lindsey. Secondly, opponents contend that libertarianism harms minorities and those who are worse off, as a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, which rejects the notion of inalienable rights, according to philosopher Robert Nozick. Thirdly, they claim that libertarianism is unjust/non-equal, as market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes, and markets fail to address important social needs. Fourthly, libertarianism removes essential laws, infrastructure, and government services such as legalizing victimless crimes and advocating for the protection of natural rights. Lastly, opponents argue that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens, as the government plays a crucial role in protecting basic human rights and the environment."

    - Evidence 1: Sustainability advocates Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins posited in their book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
    - Evidence 2: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
","The debate topic is whether we should adopt libertarianism or not. The positive supporters of libertarianism present four main claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that libertarianism increases economic growth. Advocates of reduced taxation argue that this leads to increased financial freedom and economic prosperity. Secondly, they argue that libertarianism increases freedom in the political system. By limiting the role of the government, individuals are better able to make their own decisions, leading to increased freedom and individual prosperity. Thirdly, they argue that libertarianism increases happiness and fulfillment as individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. Finally, they argue that libertarianism increases individual freedom and liberties as people are free to do what they like and opt out of undesirable arrangements. The evidence presented includes sources such as economists, psychologists, and philosophers who support the claims made by libertarians.

    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..

    - Evidence 2: Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at Oregon State University, says, Some traditions and leading figures in conservative Protestantism who were opposed to human cloning for reproductive reasons have come to see that given the ambiguity about their own views about the status of embryonic life, and given the potential for health benefits, they could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning..
- claim_4: Cloning promotes science/research.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 specifically permitted human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells, and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research in the state..
    - Evidence 2: On May 31, 1997, an issue of the popular science magazine New Scientist said that the International RaÃ«lian Movement was starting a company to fund the research and development of human cloning..
","The opponents of banning human cloning argue that it should not be banned because it can be used for various purposes such as organ replication, helping those who cannot have a child, promoting health, and promoting science and research. Regarding organ replication, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation and cloning can be used to create customized organs specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. Cloning can also help couples who are struggling with infertility by creating a child genetically related to one of the parents. Moreover, cloning can be used to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases, which can greatly advance stem cell research. Lastly, some states specifically permitted human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells or legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research, which shows that cloning promotes science and research."

- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 2: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Pope John Paul II: These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself.
    - Evidence 2: The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning in 1997. The opinion states, the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
    - Evidence 2: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..

    - Evidence 2: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
","The debate topic is whether we should ban human cloning or not. The positive supporters argue that we should ban human cloning based on four main claims. Firstly, cloning is not understood enough yet and allowing cloning would lead to converting procreation into manufacture and treating children as projects of our will. Secondly, cloning is unethical and anti-religious since it involves the manipulation and destruction of human embryos which is not morally acceptable. Thirdly, cloning is unnatural and disrupts the familial order as it involves removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship. Finally, cloning is unsafe as it risks transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child and has a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death. Therefore, based on these claims, the supporters of banning human cloning argue that it is necessary to prevent any negative consequences that may arise from this practice."

We should ban private military companies,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban private military companies', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Private military companies are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the United Nations in 2004 found evidence of private military companies using child soldiers in conflict zones..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Congressional Research Service in 2010 found evidence of unlawful killings committed by private military companies, including the killing of civilians..
- claim_2: Private military companies are not professional.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by Amnesty International in 2009 found that private military companies have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, leading to increased risk and decreased professionalism in their operations..
    - Evidence 2: A report by Human Rights Watch in 2006 found that private military companies often operate with limited accountability, making it difficult to hold them responsible for their actions..
- claim_3: Private military companies cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the Journal of Military Ethics in 2009 found that private military companies can face a conflict of interest if they have loyalty to multiple countries, potentially leading to a lack of trust in their actions..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Congressional Research Service in 2012 found that private military companies can prioritize their contractual obligations to their client over their loyalty to the country they are operating in..
- claim_4: Private military companies main interest is profit.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the journal International Affairs in 2010 found that private military companies often operate with limited accountability, making it difficult to hold them responsible for actions taken in pursuit of profit..
    - Evidence 2: A report by Human Rights Watch in 2006 found that private military companies often prioritize profit over other considerations, including ethical and legal considerations..
- claim_5: Private military companies solicit engaging, or prolonging, conflict.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Project on Government Oversight in 2008 found that private military companies have a financial incentive to prolong conflicts, as they profit from their continued involvement..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Congressional Research Service in 2009 found that the lack of accountability surrounding private military companies can lead to actions that prolong and escalate conflicts..
","The debate is centered on the ban of private military companies. The supporters of this notion argue that private military companies are unethical and are likely to violate rights and commit crimes. For instance, a report by the United Nations in 2004 revealed that private military companies use child soldiers in conflict zones, while the Congressional Research Service discovered evidence of unlawful killings of civilians by private military companies in 2010. Additionally, private military companies have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, leading to increased risk and decreased professionalism in their operations. According to a study published in the Journal of Military Ethics in 2009, private military companies can face a conflict of interest if they have loyalty to multiple countries, potentially leading to a lack of trust in their actions. Private military companies' primary interest is profit, and they often prioritize profit over ethical and legal considerations, which is evident in a report by Human Rights Watch in 2006. Furthermore, private military companies have a financial incentive to prolong conflicts, as they profit from their continued involvement, according to a report by the Project on Government Oversight in 2008. Thus, private military companies should be banned since their operations are less professional, they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country, and they have a financial incentive to solicit, engage or prolong conflicts."
We should ban the use of child actors,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban the use of child actors', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Acting may be the child's dream.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Drama Teachers Association of America in 2011 found that some children and young people have a natural talent for acting and may pursue this as a career due to their abilities..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the American Psychological Association in 2010 found that acting can provide a way for children and young people to express their emotions and can contribute to their desire to pursue a career in the performing arts..
- claim_2: Child performers are necessary for roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the National Association of Theatre Owners in 2013 found that casting children in various roles can increase the diversity in casting and provide opportunities for more actors, including children..
    - Evidence 2: In time the practice took on a professional aspect and companies of child actors would play an important role in the development of drama through the Elizabethan era and into the Jacobean and Caroline periods that followed..
- claim_3: Child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision/regulation.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Walsh would appear with the segments' usual roster of child actors to help illustrate scenarios in which children could often be in danger, and the solutions they could seek..
    - Evidence 2: One challenge for the cast and crew was filming around a child actor, meaning that the show had to obey child labor laws..
- claim_4: The parents should decide for their child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the Journal of Family Psychology in 2013 found that parents are able to provide individualized attention and care for their children, and that this is important for the child's development and well-being..
    - Evidence 2: On working as a very young child actor, Lyonne said: I didn't have the best parents..
","The debate topic is whether we should ban the use of child actors. Opponents argue against the ban by presenting four claims. First, acting may be the child's dream, supported by evidence that some children have natural talent for acting and that it can provide a way for them to express their emotions. Second, child performers are necessary for roles, as casting them can increase diversity and provide opportunities for more actors, including children. Third, child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation, exemplified by a TV show segment that obeyed child labor laws. Finally, opponents argue that parents should decide for their child, supported by evidence that parents can provide individualized attention and care for their children, and that not all child actors have the best parents."
We should ban the use of child actors,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban the use of child actors', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Being a performer harms the child's education.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the Journal of Education and Practice in 2013 found that child performers often miss school or receive inadequate education, leading to a lack of basic skills and knowledge..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the American Psychological Association in 2017 found that child performers may experience high levels of stress and pressure, leading to negative outcomes for their physical and mental health..
- claim_2: Child performers are at risk of exploitation.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the Journal of Adolescence in 2012 found that child performers are often subject to labor violations, including wage theft, lack of breaks, and poor working conditions..
    - Evidence 2: A study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014 found that child performers may be at risk of human trafficking due to their vulnerability and the lack of oversight in the industry..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A report by UNICEF in 2016 found that child actors are often exploited and exposed to unhealthy working conditions, leading to the loss of their childhood..
    - Evidence 2: Some people also criticize the parents of child actors for allowing their children to work, believing that more normal activities should be the staple during the childhood years..
- claim_4: Child performers have a lot of pressure.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014 found that child performers may experience mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, due to the pressure and stress associated with their work..
    - Evidence 2: A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics in 2013 found that child performers may experience poor mental health due to high stress levels and a lack of support, leading to negative impacts on their well-being..
- claim_5: Child performers tend to develop problems later in life.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
    - Evidence 2: There are many instances of troubled adult lives due to the stressful environment to which child actors are subjected..
","The debate topic is whether the use of child actors should be banned. Supporters of this ban argue that child actors face several challenges and risks, and should therefore not be allowed to perform. One of their main arguments is that being a performer harms the child's education. Studies have found that child performers often miss school or receive inadequate education, leading to a lack of basic skills and knowledge. Additionally, child performers are at risk of exploitation, as they may be subject to labor violations and may even be at risk of human trafficking. Supporters of the ban also argue that child performers are losing their childhood, as they are often exposed to unhealthy working conditions and are subject to a lot of pressure. This pressure can also lead to mental health issues, which may have negative impacts on their well-being later in life. In fact, there are many instances of troubled adult lives due to the stressful environment to which child actors are subjected. Therefore, supporters of the ban argue that it is necessary to protect the well-being and development of child actors by prohibiting their use in the entertainment industry."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 2: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
","The opponents argue that closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp would harm national security. The evidence shows that approximately 17.5% of former detainees confirmed of reengaging in terrorist activities, and 80 detainees remaining are hardened terrorists, which puts the country's security at risk. The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is also better for prisoners than the alternatives, as it provides humane treatment, exceeds maximum-security prison standards, and offers medical care. Moreover, the camp is an essential location to gain intelligence, as it was designed to be an intelligence center of excellence in the war on terror, and the need to obtain intelligence from high-ranking terrorists remains critical for national security."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 2: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
    - Evidence 2: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
    - Evidence 2: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
","The supporters of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp argue that there are several reasons to do so. Firstly, detainees have the right to trial in US courts, as affirmed by the US Supreme Court's ruling in Boumediene v. Bush. Additionally, the camp harms the reputation of the US as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it is a symbol of discrimination and injustice. The camp is also expensive to maintain, with an estimated annual cost of $540 million. Moreover, personnel at the camp have committed crimes against prisoners, including torture, and unjust tactics are used there, such as stress positions, isolation, and hooding during transportation and questioning. Therefore, the supporters believe that closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp is necessary."
We should end affirmative action,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect..
    - Evidence 2: Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, told CBS News, 'If we as a nation are serious about creating equity and justice, we have to institute programs that have been proven to create more equity in our schools, in our colleges, and our workplaces.' He added, 'Affirmative action programs in education have been demonstrated to increase diversity and increase access specifically for underrepresented groups.'.
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
    - Evidence 2: In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation's economic opportunities [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
    - Evidence 2: The National Organization for Women (NOW) stated the following in its article 'Talking About Affirmative Action,':'Affirmative Action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95% to 97% of the high-level corporate jobs. And that’s with affirmative action programs in place. Imagine how low figures would be without affirmative action.'.
","The opponents of ending affirmative action argue that it should not be ended because it boosts diversity, compensates for the past, and reduces discrimination. They provide evidence to support these claims. Affirmative action has been proven to increase diversity and provide access to underrepresented groups, as demonstrated by a decline in admissions for students of color after affirmative action bans go into effect. Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for past discrimination, as it was designed to correct and prevent discrimination from recurring. It has also been upheld by court cases as a means to reduce discrimination, such as in Johnson v. Transportation Agency. The National Organization for Women also argues that affirmative action levels the playing field for people of color and women in education and business, as white men hold a disproportionate amount of high-level corporate jobs. Therefore, affirmative action should be continued to promote diversity, compensate for the past, and reduce discrimination."
We should end affirmative action,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some opponents believe, among other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive..
    - Evidence 2: Opponents of affirmative action such as George Sher believe that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who are chosen based on the social group to which they belong rather than their qualifications [REF]..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2010 Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107 [REF]..
    - Evidence 2: With privileged African Americans gaining professional upward mobility through affirmative action and equal opportunity sanctions in education and employment, the less-skilled, less-educated African Americans fall behind..
- claim_3: Affirmative action is not just.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..
    - Evidence 2: Affirmative action is peak performative activism, as it focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities..
- claim_4: Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Opponents,[REF] who sometimes say that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination', further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects in addition to failing to achieve its goals..
    - Evidence 2: Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticised as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger..
- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
    - Evidence 2: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
","The topic under discussion is whether affirmative action should be ended or not. The supporters of ending affirmative action have put forward several claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities. Opponents believe that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive. Secondly, affirmative action is ineffective. Arizona passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action in 2010, which indicates that it is not an effective policy. Thirdly, affirmative action is not just. Asian-American students are marked down on "

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging, as older workers can continue to contribute to the workforce, using their skills and experience to benefit society..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the World Health Organization in 2013 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready can promote well-being, as it gives individuals greater control over their lives and allows them to pursue activities that bring them happiness and fulfillment..
","The debate is about whether or not to end mandatory retirement, and the positive supporters argue that we should end it. They make five claims to support their stance. First, they argue that mandatory retirement decreases institutional knowledge, as shown by the lack of mandatory retirement for Air Traffic Controllers in the UK and the success of a businessman who implemented policies against mandatory retirement. Second, they argue that mandatory retirement harms the economy by reducing workforce diversity and labor force participation, as evidenced by studies by the World Economic Forum and the OECD. Third, they argue that mandatory retirement is unfair and discriminatory, as older workers are forced to retire regardless of their ability to continue working and individual circumstances, as shown by the AARP and ILO studies. Fourth, they argue that mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, as supported by evidence from studies by Jonathan Gruber and David Wise and by Richard Johnson, Jonathan Schwabish and Jennifer Topper. Finally, they argue that we should let everyone retire when they are ready to promote active aging, well-being, and individual choice, as shown by reports by the AARP and the World Health Organization."

We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 2: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 2: On 21 September 2022, Mr Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” of Russian citizens to serve in the war in Ukraine. He also accused NATO members of making statements about “the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia”. He threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory: In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff..
","The supporters of the abolition of nuclear weapons argue that there are compelling reasons to eliminate these weapons from the world. Firstly, there is a significant risk that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands, which could lead to catastrophic consequences. This risk is not merely theoretical, as there is evidence that terrorist groups such as ISIS have expressed their desire to acquire nuclear weapons. Secondly, the presence of nuclear weapons provokes or escalates disastrous military actions, as the potential for mass destruction and loss of life is too great to ignore. This is illustrated by the estimated death tolls in the event of a nuclear attack, as well as the recent tensions between Russia and NATO over the use of nuclear weapons in the conflict in Ukraine. Therefore, the supporters argue that it is necessary to take action to abolish nuclear weapons in order to prevent such catastrophic events from occurring."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives..
    - Evidence 2: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
    - Evidence 2: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
","The opponents argue against the stance that 'We should fight urbanization' and present three claims with supporting evidence. Firstly, they argue that cities offer more opportunities, as evidenced by migration to urban areas for better lives and increased urbanization leading to growing economic opportunities. Secondly, they argue that urbanization benefits the economy, as evidenced by government policies encouraging the urbanization of China's rural population and the positive effects of urbanization on economic growth, efficiency, diversity, occupational and social mobility, and adaptability. Thirdly, they argue that urbanization benefits the environment, as evidenced by driving innovation including green technologies and bringing higher productivity due to positive externalities and economies of scale, which reduces the ecological footprint."
We should fight urbanization,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
    - Evidence 2: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: MÄori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid urbanisation and growing population have increased criminal activities in Bopal & Ghuma..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization are associated with a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (see also acid rain) and hydrogen sulfide, which may affect plant metabolism..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 2: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..
","The topic of the debate is whether we should fight urbanization or not. The positive supporters argue that we should fight urbanization based on the following claims and evidence. 

Firstly, they argue that restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically and socially. Evidence 1 shows that Venezuela's rural areas have seen economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment, resulting in a net food importer. Similarly, Evidence 2 suggests that protecting natural resources can prevent rural to urban migration. 

Secondly, they argue that urbanization causes crime. Evidence 1 shows that increased urban migration in New Zealand led to a rise in urban crime, poverty, and health problems. Evidence 2 shows that the rapid urbanization and growing population in India have increased criminal activities. 

Thirdly, they argue that urbanization harms the environment. Evidence 1 suggests that increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies, and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water. Evidence 2 shows that rapid economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization increase energy demand and air pollutant emissions, which can affect plant metabolism. 

Finally, they argue that urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources. Evidence 1 shows that overurbanization leads to inadequate housing, almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease, high mortality, and large urban groups with no access to educational facilities. Evidence 2 suggests that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage it, leading to migrant workers without an affordable place to live in. 

In summary, the supporters of fighting urbanization argue that urbanization has negative effects on the economy, society, environment, and cities' resources."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 2: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
    - Evidence 2: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..
","The opponents of introducing compulsory voting have presented three main claims. Firstly, abstaining from voting is also a way of expressing one's preferences, as it can indicate ambivalence, mild disapproval, lack of information or reluctance to vote against popular sentiment. Secondly, citizens have a right not to vote, and mandatory voting would violate their freedom of speech and civil liberties. Finally, compulsory voting may result in uninformed or random voting, as people who are less informed are more likely to be influenced by negative advertising and slogans, and mandatory voting can increase the vote share of mainstream parties while reducing the diversity of political representation."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
","The topic of the debate is whether compulsory voting should be introduced. The positive supporters of this proposition put forward three main claims. Firstly, that compulsory voting increases representation. This is supported by evidence showing that boosting turnout is a matter of justice and representation and that compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all voters. Secondly, supporters argue that compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. This is evidenced by the idea that it increases political education and that concerns about declining democratic engagement have been raised. Finally, supporters claim that people have an obligation to vote, citing a ruling from the European Court of Human Rights that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms and that compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout. Overall, the supporters of compulsory voting believe that it is necessary to ensure that everyone is represented and that democracy is upheld."
We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke..
    - Evidence 2: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
    - Evidence 2: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 2: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..
","The opponents of legalizing cannabis argue that it should not be legalized because it can harm the body, increase lack-of-judgment/accidents, act as a gateway drug/addictive, and get into the hands of underage teenagers/children. Heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana can change blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Additionally, an increase in THC content can impair psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers. Furthermore, cannabis can cause people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual. The percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis has increased, and cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers and individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Cannabis triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine, which creates good feelings, leading to repeated use and addiction, which is a brain disease. It also alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on the brain, causing the user to use more heroin. Lastly, legal cannabis can be easily accessed by underage teenagers/children, leading to an increase in cannabis use. Therefore, the opponents believe that cannabis should not be legalized."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 2: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
    - Evidence 2: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
","The debate topic is about legalizing cannabis, and its positive supporters have presented five claims. Firstly, they argue that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal, citing evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. Secondly, they believe that legalizing cannabis is financially beneficial, and it could generate billions in annual tax revenues and reduce government spending for prohibition enforcement. Thirdly, they argue that cannabis is safe, healthy, and provides pain relief. Fourthly, if cannabis were legalized, it could be regulated, and cannabis-related crimes could be reduced. Lastly, supporters believe that legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market and criminal activity, and it could decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking, leading to a decrease in drug-related violent crime."
We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
    - Evidence 2: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
    - Evidence 2: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
    - Evidence 2: Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men..
","The opponents of legalizing prostitution put forward three main claims. Firstly, legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, with evidence indicating that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population, and that a significant number of registered and foreign prostitutes have tested HIV positive.

- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 2: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 2: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 2: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 2: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
","The debate topic is whether prostitution should be legalized or not. Those in favor of legalizing prostitution argue that it would bring several benefits. Firstly, legalizing sex work can boost the economy, as was the case with Seattle's founder, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard. Secondly, it could increase the benefits available to sex workers, such as health care, safe sex, unionization, and labor rights, as advocated by the Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour. Thirdly, legalizing sex work can allow it to be regulated, which could enhance safety and human rights, as is the case with the Dutch policy of tolerance towards prostitution. Fourthly, it would make the profession safer for women by reducing harm, protecting them from exploitation and trafficking. Lastly, sex work is a valid choice over one's body, which can provide greater disposable income and access to lifestyle options. Overall, these benefits suggest that legalizing prostitution could be a positive step for society."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
    - Evidence 2: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
    - Evidence 2: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 2: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
","The opponents of legalizing sex selection argue that it can have negative consequences. Firstly, it can lead to gender imbalance, as seen in countries such as India and China where having boys is preferred over having girls. This has led to a decline in the number of girls being born and a significant gender gap. Secondly, sex selection reinforces gender stereotypes and biases, particularly in traditional and rural areas where son preference is strong. Thirdly, legalizing sex selection can result in an increase in abortions and infanticide, as parents can choose to abort a female fetus or even neglect and kill female infants. These negative consequences outweigh any potential benefits of legalizing sex selection."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 2: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 2: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
","The debate topic is 'We should legalize sex selection', and the proponents of the topic have presented five claims to support their stance. 

The first claim is that it is within the freedom of parents to select the sex of the child. They argue that gender selection allows parents to fulfill their wish or desire to have a daughter or son, instilling gender balance in the family. They also state that it could prevent gender-specific diseases from being passed on to the baby.

The second claim is that sex selection allows for better family planning. They state that gender selection gives parents effective control over the number of children they want and helps parents in countries like China, where couples are allowed only one or two children, to have a male child who will carry the father's family name. 

The third claim is that sex selection makes the family happier and complete. They argue that parents or couples may prefer a specific gender for their first-born or want a gender to balance their family, and sex selection gives them an opportunity to fulfill their wishes.

The fourth claim is that sex selection prevents diseases in the child. They state that selecting a female embryo offspring can prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases and can also be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are more prevalent in one sex.

The fifth claim is that sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide. They argue that gender selection provides intended parents with the ability to pick the sex of their children, and some may not even realize they have a preference until they have the option to choose. They also state that female infanticide is a significant issue in some countries where baby girls are killed due to a preference for male babies.

Overall, the proponents of the topic argue that legalizing sex selection will provide parents with more freedom and control over their family planning, make the family happier and complete, prevent diseases, and prevent abortions and infanticide."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 2: Judge White did not go so far as to say that flag-burning is not constitutionally protected; rather, he wrote that without the benefit of the majority's thinking if it were to find flag burning protected by the First Amendment, I would sustain such a conviction..
","The opponents of the topic 'We should prohibit flag burning' argue that flag burning is a form of expression, protest, and critique, which makes it an effective tool. They support their argument with evidence such as the case of Gregory Lee Johnson, who was convicted of flag desecration in Texas but was later ruled in favor by the court. The court stated that flag burning is a form of expression and, therefore, protected under the First Amendment. Additionally, they argue that flag burning is justified under freedom of expression, citing Justice William Brennan's opinion that flag burning is protected speech under the First Amendment. Thus, they believe that prohibiting flag burning would be a violation of the First Amendment."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Warren was of the opinion that laws against flag-burning are constitutional.
    - Evidence 2: By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag..
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
","The topic being debated is whether or not flag burning should be prohibited. Supporters of the proposition argue that flags are important symbols that should be respected, and flag burning is an inflammatory act. They cite evidence that laws against flag-burning are constitutional and that all states had adopted flag desecration laws by 1932, which outlawed placing any kind of marking on the flag, using it in any form of advertising, and publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt upon it. Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that it is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed, and evidence was presented of a protest march that culminated with the burning of the American flag, along with a consistently anti-US line being broadcast on a local radio station. Overall, supporters of the proposition believe that flag burning should be prohibited due to the importance of respecting flags as symbols and the inflammatory nature of the act."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
    - Evidence 2: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 2: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 2: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 2: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
","The opponents of the topic 'We should prohibit women in combat' put forth several compelling arguments. Firstly, there should be equality between men and women, and this has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957. Women have made significant progress in health and labor participation and are now considered an asset in combat. Studies show that women can create unique skills and strategies, and they can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat as men. Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to, and they should be accepted as long as they pass the tests, which are objective, measurable, role-related, and gender-free. It is sexist and stupid to keep women from fighting in combat, and the idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying. As Senator Ernst said, women would be essential in any future conflict, and they could serve in various roles, including the infantry or a cyber unit. Thus, women should not be prohibited from serving in combat roles."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
    - Evidence 2: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
    - Evidence 2: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
    - Evidence 2: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
    - Evidence 2: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
","The debate is centered on whether women should be prohibited from serving in combat roles. The proponents of the idea believe that men are better suited for combat than women. They argue that women lack the physical and mental capabilities required for combat. The first argument presented is that women are generally physically smaller and have less muscle density than men. They argue that even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. The second argument is that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers that are required for combat. They provide evidence that shows only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units.

","The opponents argue that government intervention to subsidize journalism can be problematic. They claim that such intervention has the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. They provide evidence to support this claim, such as political endorsements creating opportunities to construe favoritism in reporting and potentially creating a perceived conflict of interest.

We should subsidize journalism,1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..
    - Evidence 2: Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting..
- claim_2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news..
    - Evidence 2: Further technological development within the world of the Internet points to a trend of increased usage of non-institutionalized, non-governmental, non-administrative and clearly transnational information during reporting and research work..
- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The IFJ launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative in 2008, a global campaign to defend standards and to raise awareness of the importance of quality journalism..
    - Evidence 2: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..
","The supporters of subsidizing journalism argue that it is necessary to make journalism viable as it is becoming increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism. Additionally, they claim that journalism is important for information-spreading and accountability, citing examples of the Associated Press becoming increasingly important and efficient, and the trend of increased usage of non-institutionalized information during reporting and research work. Furthermore, they argue that subsidies will increase the quality of journalism as evident from the Ethical Journalism Initiative launched by the IFJ. The rationale behind this is that by providing subsidies, new entrants and small players can compete against the powerful incumbents, thus facilitating democratic decision-making."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 2: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 2: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 2: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
","The opponents argue that space exploration should not be subsidized because it can be carried out by the private sector, it is expensive, ineffective, and there are more pressing issues to fund. They provide evidence such as the success of commercial space ventures like SpaceX, the high cost of space travel, the lack of scientific usefulness in human space exploration, and the need to prioritize issues like poverty. Additionally, they mention the dangers and potential waste of resources associated with space exploration."

    - Evidence 2: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
    - Evidence 2: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 2: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
    - Evidence 2: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
    - Evidence 2: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..
","The debate is about whether or not we should subsidize space exploration. Those in favor of subsidizing it have presented five arguments. Firstly, space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets, which can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species. Secondly, space exploration improves science/technology by facilitating studies in biomedicine and materials science and by offering benefits to sectors like agriculture. Thirdly, space exploration is financially beneficial and has the potential to generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, with satellite broadband Internet access being the most significant short and medium-term opportunity. Fourthly, space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity as it will help us develop technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions, which we can use as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. Lastly, space exploration unravels information about the universe, making significant contributions to our understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems."
We should subsidize vocational education,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize vocational education', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education can divert money from other important programs, such as early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the National Science Board in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education may not ensure quality, as many programs may not meet standards for curriculum, instruction, and assessment..
- claim_2: subsidizing vocational education is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Center for American Progress in 2018 found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be expensive, as many programs require significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be limited by the ability to scale, as many programs may not have the resources or infrastructure to serve large numbers of students..
- claim_3: subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The study found that a large-scale subsidy program for vocational education in Germany led to a significant increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs. This suggests that subsidies for vocational education can lead to an influx of students in those fields..
    - Evidence 2: The study analyzed the effects of a program in Germany that provided subsidies for vocational training and found that the program increased the demand for skilled workers in the relevant trades. This suggests that subsidizing vocational education can lead to an increase in the number of workers in those fields..
- claim_4: vocational education is not a good career choice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the National Center for Education and the Economy in 2014 found that many vocational education programs offer limited transferability of skills, making it difficult for workers to transition to new careers or industries, even when job opportunities change..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience..
","The opponents argue against subsidizing vocational education by presenting four claims. Firstly, they state that it diverts money from other worthy causes such as early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education. They support this argument by referring to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020. Secondly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education is expensive because it requires significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty, and may not have the resources to serve a large number of students, as found by a report by the Center for American Progress in 2018 and a study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020. Thirdly, they assert that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions, as seen in Germany, where a large-scale subsidy program for vocational education led to a significant increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in academic programs. They also cite a study that analyzed the effects of a program in Germany that provided subsidies for vocational training and found that the program increased the demand for skilled workers in the relevant trades. Lastly, the opponents argue that vocational education is not a good career choice because many vocational education programs offer limited transferability of skills, making it difficult for workers to transition to new careers or industries.

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022 found that there is high demand for skilled workers in industries such as healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing, and vocational education can provide training and education in these fields..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that individuals with vocational education often have shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education..
- claim_4: vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that vocational education programs can address workforce shortages in specific fields and industries, which can benefit the entire market and society by filling in-demand jobs..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that investments in vocational education can enhance social mobility by providing access to training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by increasing the opportunities available to individuals from diverse backgrounds..
","The debate topic is 'We should subsidize vocational education'. Those in favor of this proposition have put forward the following claims: 
Firstly, subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources, as it can improve workforce development, particularly for individuals who face barriers to employment. This is supported by a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019, which found that subsidizing vocational education can also better align with local labor market needs, particularly in regions with high demand for skilled workers.

Secondly, vocational education better fits many students as it provides a more direct path to employment, with programs designed to meet current workforce needs and provide relevant training and education. This is supported by a study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in 2020, which found that vocational education provides hands-on, practical learning that better fits the learning styles and interests of many students, compared to traditional classroom-based education.

Thirdly, vocational education is a good career choice as there is high demand for skilled workers in industries such as healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing, and vocational education can provide training and education in these fields. Additionally, individuals with vocational education often have shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education. These claims are supported by a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022 and a report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020.

Finally, vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society as it can address workforce shortages in specific fields and industries, which can benefit the entire market and society by filling in-demand jobs. Additionally, investments in vocational education can enhance social mobility by providing access to training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by increasing the opportunities available to individuals from diverse backgrounds. These claims are supported by a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 and a report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020. Overall, subsidizing vocational education can have significant benefits for individuals, the labor market, and society as a whole."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
    - Evidence 2: Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 2: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying argue that if a person does not wish to take advantage of a change in the law which would allow for an assisted death then that is down to personal choice..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 2: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
","The opponents of the stance that assisted suicide should be a criminal offense argue that it provides dignity to those who wish to control their death. The group Dignity in Dying asserts that the current laws offer no protection for those who want to end their lives and that many people travel abroad before they are ready to die due to fear of becoming too weak to make the journey. They argue that terminally ill individuals should have the right to medical assistance in ending their lives, subject to prescribed safeguards. They further argue that legalizing assisted suicide reduces the suffering of those who are experiencing unbearable and hopeless pain. People should have the freedom to choose to end their life, and if a person does not want to take advantage of this option, it is their personal choice. Finally, the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide, as it provides an alternative to terminal sedation with the loss of consciousness when no other way can relieve the pain or suffering of a dying patient."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dr. Lynda Young, MD, stated her opposition when she said, 'Physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer.'.
    - Evidence 2: The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient..
- claim_2: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
    - Evidence 2: Any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted of assisting suicide or attempting to do so..
- claim_3: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
    - Evidence 2: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
","The debate topic is whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offence. Supporters of this stance argue that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role as a healer and that people do not have the right to self-harm or harm others. They also argue that people who are ill may not have clear judgment and are in need of help. Evidence supporting these claims includes statements from Dr. Lynda Young, MD, who believes physician-assisted suicide is incompatible with a doctor's role as a healer, and the State of New York's prohibition against physician-assisted suicide. The New Zealand Medical Association also opposes voluntary euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide, while any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted. Finally, studies from the Netherlands fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the non-voluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others. The slippery slope argument is also applied to the euthanasia debate, claiming that the acceptance of certain practices will lead to the acceptance of concepts that are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
    - Evidence 2: Unschoolers cite studies which report that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers, and some believe this is a result of the wide range of people with which they have the opportunity to communicate..
","The debate is on whether homeschooling should be banned. Those who oppose the ban argue that homeschooling is often the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students. Evidence shows that homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, young athletes, and actors who are taught at home. Additionally, homeschooling can be personalized to the child's pace and needs, which mainstream schools often fail to meet, leading to unhappy parents. Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs, alcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality that is prevalent in mainstream schools. They believe that parents should be allowed to choose the education of their children, giving them a deeper understanding of their children's education progress and the liberty to explore their own family's culture. Lastly, unschoolers argue that the home is a good learning environment, citing studies that show home-educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers because of the wide range of people with which they communicate. Therefore, banning homeschooling would deprive parents and children of the benefits that come with homeschooling."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 2: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 2: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..
","The debate topic is whether homeschooling should be banned. Supporters of the ban argue that homeschooling cannot be standardized or regulated, which can lead to potential abuse or neglect. They argue that mainstream schools are essential for the development of social skills and offer experiences, such as work experience opportunities, sports leagues, and recognition and reward, that homeschooled children miss out on. Additionally, mainstream schools are of higher educational quality, as teachers are required to have education degrees and may have more experience working with and teaching children. Finally, supporters argue that parents are not qualified as teachers and taking on the role of a teacher and administrator adds stress and fatigue to the parent's role. Overall, supporters of the ban on homeschooling believe that mainstream schools provide a vital social safety net for children, as well as a higher quality of education and opportunities."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
    - Evidence 2: The CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, and a “small possibility” exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disorder in which the person’s immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system, in about one or two per million people vaccinated..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as in the European Convention on Human Rights..
    - Evidence 2: The First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'.
","The debate topic is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. Opponents of mandatory vaccinations make two main claims. The first claim is that routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous. They point to the example of Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, which was pulled from the market nine months after it was introduced due to its potential link to bowel obstruction. Additionally, they argue that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine and that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome. The second claim is that mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights. Compulsory vaccination is seen as an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Opponents also argue that mandatory vaccination is a violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects the free exercise of religion."

    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
    - Evidence 2: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.

    - Evidence 1: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
    - Evidence 2: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
    - Evidence 2: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
    - Evidence 2: Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..
    - Evidence 2: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..
","The debate topic is about whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory or not. Those who support mandatory vaccinations argue that routine child vaccinations are effective, save lives, necessary to protect others, prevent virus/disease spreading and children should not suffer from preventable diseases. The first argument is that routine child vaccinations are effective, as evidenced by the decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease and polio cases due to vaccination programs. The second argument is that vaccinations save lives, as evidenced by the decrease in childhood deaths from measles and the prevention of millions of illnesses, hospitalizations and early deaths of children. The third argument is that routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others, as evidenced by the outbreaks of pertussis and measles due to low herd immunity. The fourth argument is that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading, as evidenced by the effectiveness of pertussis vaccines and vaccination during pregnancy. The fifth argument is that children should not suffer from preventable diseases, as evidenced by the resurgence of preventable diseases due to vaccine hesitancy and the decrease in infections caused by Hib since the introduction of a vaccine."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Lack of enforcement of the European Union’s data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., has also cast a shadow over the new laws..
    - Evidence 2: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
    - Evidence 2: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
    - Evidence 2: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
    - Evidence 2: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
    - Evidence 2: Around the US 2016 election, Russian entities set up and promoted fake Pages on Facebook to influence public sentiment — essentially using social media as an information weapon..
","The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government, and the opponents argue against it by presenting five claims. The first claim is that social media regulation is not effective, and they support it with evidence that the lack of enforcement of data privacy laws in the European Union and in other legislation shows that Facebook and Google have not faced consequences for their data collection practices. The second claim is that social media regulation harms privacy, and they support it with evidence that people feel they have little control over how their personal information is used. The third claim is that social media regulation harms freedom of speech and other democratic rights, and they support it with evidence of countries passing laws that jeopardise human rights and press freedom. The fourth claim is that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, and they support it with evidence that government intervention can cause market disruptions and inefficiency. The fifth claim is that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government, and they support it with evidence of political advertisements targeting minority communities and fake pages set up by Russian entities during the 2016 US election."

- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.
    - Evidence 2: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
    - Evidence 2: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'This proportionate new framework will ensure we don’t put unnecessary burdens on small businesses but give large digital businesses robust rules of the road to follow so we can seize the brilliance of modern technology to improve our lives.'.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
    - Evidence 2: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.

    - Evidence 2: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..
","The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. The positive supporters argue that regulation is necessary for various reasons. Firstly, social media regulation protects younger audiences from harmful content. This is evidenced by cases such as Molly Russell's death, where her social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Secondly, social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news, which was widespread during the US presidential campaign. Thirdly, social media regulation is beneficial to society at large, as it creates sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, while also recognizing the great things about online, including free expression. Fourthly, social media regulation can help to deal with negative content, such as disinformation or hate speech. Finally, social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users, as evidenced by the unauthorized access of 60 million online social network accounts in 2011, and the Russian operation Internet Research Agency's interference in the US presidential election of 2016. Overall, these supporters argue that social media platforms need to be regulated by the government to ensure the safety and well-being of society at large."

- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In their study of polarization across nations, Thomas Carothers and Andrew O’Donohue argue that polarization runs particularly deep in the U.S. in part because American polarization is 'especially multifaceted.'.
    - Evidence 2: According to Carothers and O’Donohue, a “powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion renders America’s divisions unusually encompassing and profound..
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045). Simply living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, researchers suggest..
    - Evidence 2: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..
    - Evidence 2: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The United States’ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019—the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany—according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..
    - Evidence 2: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
    - Evidence 2: A country where, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 253 mass shootings in the country since the beginning of 2019. That’s more shootings than days. Two of those occurred over the weekend in less than 24 hours, first in El Paso, Texas followed by Dayton, Ohio, leaving 31 dead..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..
    - Evidence 2: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
","The opponents argue that the USA is not a good country to live in because it has several issues. The first issue is the unfair health and education policies. Many children under the age of 18 are without health insurance, and adults in households with low incomes find it difficult to afford healthcare costs. The second issue is the problematic and divisive political system. The polarization in the USA is particularly multifaceted, making it difficult to overcome. The third issue is the negative culture, where there is little respect for others, and people tend to climb the social ladder at the expense of others' dignity. The fourth issue is the high taxation and high costs of living, making it difficult for people to invest and secure their financial future. The fifth issue is the inequality and poverty, where the top 10% of Americans hold nearly 70% of the wealth. Lastly, the USA is considered unsafe due to the high number of mass shootings and the perception of safety among people. Additionally, the USA is considered xenophobic and racist, where racial discrimination continues to exist in the labor market, and middle-class blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites."

There are more than 400 areas which are protected and maintained by the National Park Service, and many other parks in each state..
    - Evidence 2: The landscape varies across the large country from tropical beaches in Florida to peaks in the Rocky Mountains, from rolling prairie lands and barren deserts in the West to dense wilderness areas in the Northeast and Northwest. Interspersed throughout are the Great Lakes, the Grand Canyon, the majestic Yosemite Valley, and the mighty Mississippi River..

Article 1 states: “The peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it.” It also states that: 'Democracy is essential for the social, political, and economic development of the peoples of the Americas.'.
- claim_5: The US has great people/culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The United States is sometimes described as a 'melting pot', according to Golden Beacon USA(opens in new tab), in which different cultures have contributed their own distinct 'flavors' to American culture.

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
    - Evidence 2: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 2: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
","The opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy for priests present multiple arguments to support their stance. First, they argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, and advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart. Second, celibacy is a strong religious belief and has been a privilege for the religious who have taken the vow of celibacy. Third, celibacy makes priests be perceived as holy, and the holy bishops, priests, and deacons of God should observe perfect continence. Fourth, priests choose to be celibate, and during the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Fifth, religious experiences and traditions should be maintained. Finally, removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, and celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church."

- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..
    - Evidence 2: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the wake of the clergy sexual abuse scandals, some critics have charged that priestly celibacy was a contributing factor.
    - Evidence 2: Christoph Sch√∂nborn and Hans K√ºng have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church..
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy..
    - Evidence 2: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
","The debate topic is whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned, and the positive supporters argue in favor of abandoning it. The first argument is that celibacy is outdated, supported by evidence that clerical celibacy should become optional and that change is inevitable. The second argument is that celibacy is too pressuring/difficult, supported by evidence that suppressing sexual urges has led to warped behavior, and celibacy is difficult to maintain without companionship. The third argument is that celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural, supported by evidence that it goes against nature's design for living organisms to reproduce and that it can cause depression and conflict. The fourth argument is that celibacy leads to wrong sexual behavior, as evidenced by the clergy sexual abuse scandals and statements by religious figures that celibacy may contribute to such behavior. The fifth argument is that celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests, supported by evidence that some individuals refuse ordination to avoid taking the vow and that ending celibacy could address the priest shortage."

And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, it’s possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
    - Evidence 2: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 2: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 2: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..
","The opponents argue that we should not abandon marriage. They support their stance with five claims. Firstly, they argue that marriage benefits children as those raised in intact married families are physically and emotionally healthier, less likely to be abused, and have a decreased risk of divorce when they get married. Secondly, they claim that marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons, as it has a positive impact on children and society. Thirdly, they state that marriage makes people happy, as married people appear to be happier than those who are not married. Fourthly, they argue that marriage makes the couple closer as married adults are more satisfied and trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting. Lastly, they claim that marriage provides important financial benefits such as tax deductions for combined income and healthcare."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
    - Evidence 2: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
    - Evidence 2: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 2: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
","The debate topic is whether we should abandon marriage. Those in favor of abandoning marriage argue that marriage preserves norms that are harmful to women, marriages are unstable, marriages tie up people with unfair obligations, and most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship. They provide evidence to support each of these claims, such as the growing body of evidence that shows the effects of marriage are worse for women than for men, the fact that divorce rates have increased globally since the 1970s, and the unfair treatment of wives perpetuated by laws governing marital relations. They also argue that monogamous relationships foster emotional intimacy and reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Overall, supporters of abandoning marriage believe that the institution perpetuates inequality and is no longer necessary for fulfilling intimate relationships."

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
    - Evidence 2: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 2: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
    - Evidence 2: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
","The debate topic is whether we should abandon the use of school uniforms. Opponents of abandoning school uniforms make the following arguments:
Firstly, children can still express themselves using other means. Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered the speech that the Constitution guarantees, and research shows that more than half of eighth-graders feel they can still express themselves even when following a school uniform policy.
Secondly, school uniforms reduce bullying.

We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
    - Evidence 2: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
    - Evidence 2: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:

    - Evidence 2: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
","The debate topic is whether we should abandon the use of school uniform or not. The supporters of abandoning school uniforms put forward several claims to support their stance.

We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
    - Evidence 2: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
    - Evidence 2: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as deliberate and systematic .. extrajudicial killings, and has condemned them as crimes against humanity..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
","The opponents of abolishing capital punishment present several arguments in support of retaining it. First, they argue that the death penalty provides closure for victims' families and expresses society's moral outrage for the most atrocious crimes. They cite specific cases of heinous crimes, such as that of Daniel Lewis Lee, to support this claim. Second, they argue that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, although the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Human Rights Watch oppose the use of the death penalty for juveniles and condemn extrajudicial killings. Third, they claim that the death penalty prevents crimes by deterring potential murderers. They refer to a study by Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd that shows a strong deterrent effect of capital punishment, with each execution resulting in 18 fewer murders on average. Charles Stimson also supports this claim, arguing that the death penalty serves the penological objectives of general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. Overall, opponents of abolishing capital punishment argue that the death penalty is necessary for justice and deterrence."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
    - Evidence 2: In one occasion, Persian daily Neshat published an article which called for abolishing the death penalty, claiming that the capital punishment is no cure for maladies afflicting modern society..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
    - Evidence 2: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
","The debate topic is about abolishing capital punishment and the supporters of this view have presented three main claims to support their argument. The first claim is that state-sanctioned killing is wrong, as evidenced by the unfair and unjust application of the death penalty in the US, where people of color and those without financial means are disproportionately affected. Innocent people are also too often sentenced to death. The second claim is that the death penalty harms the disenfranchised, as it diverts resources from other cases and programs that could better increase public safety, health, and welfare. The third claim is that the death penalty is irreversible, and deterrence plays no part in its application. Studies show that fear of the death penalty may cause some to hesitate, but not enough to keep it in force. Furthermore, the death penalty is not a deterrent, as evidenced by the consistent lower murder rates in states without the death penalty compared to those with it."

","The opponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that these rights incentivize creativity and innovation, as well as investment in developing new products. The evidence supporting these claims includes theories that view intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivizing the creation of new creative works and the positive correlation between strengthening the IP system and subsequent economic growth. Additionally, intellectual property rights protect against stealing, and owners of intellectual property should be compensated for their endeavors.

    - Evidence 1: Tucker did not believe in intellectual property rights in the form of patents, on the grounds that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot rightfully be held as property..
    - Evidence 2: The Electronic Frontier Foundation has pointed out that criminal law is poorly suited for regulation of intellectual property law and that IPRED2 presents a risk to industry and innovation..
","The proponents of abolishing intellectual property rights make the following arguments: 

Firstly, intellectual property rights prevent the continuous improvement of a service/product by creating monopolies that harm health, prevent progress, and benefit concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses. Secondly, intellectual property restricts access to important information and products, making it difficult for users to upload content to sites without fear of criminal liability. Thirdly, intellectual property rights are unfair because they prohibit people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material, infringing upon freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Fourthly, intellectual property rights harm creativity and innovation as they discourage it. Fifthly, intellectual property rights waste money, particularly for the first time, when getting protection for complex products, methods, designs, and processes.

- claim_1: Gun control is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates..
    - Evidence 2: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For today’s gun owners, the right to own guns nearly rivals other rights laid out in the U.S. Constitution in terms of its personal salience. About three-quarters of gun owners (74%) say this right is essential to their own sense of freedom..
    - Evidence 2: The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision. 'Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,' he said..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment..
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
    - Evidence 2: Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer..
","The opponents argue that the right to keep and bear arms should not be abolished. Firstly, they claim that gun control is ineffective, as several studies have shown that most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates and that restrictions on carrying concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders. Secondly, they argue that gun ownership is a right, as many gun owners believe that it is essential to their own sense of freedom and the U.S. Constitution guarantees this right. Thirdly, they argue that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports-shooting, as millions of people use firearms for these purposes, and hunters spend billions of dollars on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment. Lastly, they argue that gun ownership promotes self-protection, as gun owners cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm, and owning a gun makes them feel safer according to a Pew Foundation report."

    - Evidence 1: When Missouri repealed its permit law, gun-related killings increased by 25 percent..
    - Evidence 2: Data even tells us that where gun shops or gun dealers open for business, killings go up..
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: 'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add..
    - Evidence 2: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
- claim_3: Guns can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
    - Evidence 2: 'Guns do fall into the wrong hands,' Commissioner Ramsey said, adding that many guns used by criminals were originally purchased legally..
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A 2001 study found that regardless of age, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns..
    - Evidence 2: A study from 2014 showed that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm..
","The supporters of the motion argue that the right to keep and bear arms should be abolished. Their arguments are based on the following claims:

Firstly, they claim that banning guns would save lives. They provide evidence that shows that gun-related killings increased by 25 percent when Missouri repealed its permit law and that killings also go up where gun dealers open for business.

Secondly, they argue that gun ownership allows for mass-shootings and general gun violence. They provide evidence that shows a correlation between permissiveness of gun laws and mass shootings and that guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide.

Thirdly, they claim that guns can fall into the wrong hands, leading to violence and death. They provide evidence of the Sutherland Springs massacre, where a man with a domestic violence conviction was able to buy guns and kill 26 people. They also add that many guns used by criminals were originally purchased legally.

Lastly, they argue that guns lead to accidental deaths. They provide evidence that people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns and that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: “For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
    - Evidence 2: “Taking care of ‘at risk’ children is a mandatory concern. However, youth centres and outreach services are considered unessential and have been cut to the bone. Yet these are services that help prevent children becoming ‘at risk’ in the first place,” said Gray..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
    - Evidence 2: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
    - Evidence 2: I was 18 [and homeless] and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work. I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing – Tayah, west London..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
    - Evidence 2: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
    - Evidence 2: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
","The proponents of adopting an austerity regime face strong opposition from those who argue that it is not a viable solution. They present several claims with supporting evidence to substantiate their arguments. Firstly, austerity measures lead to cuts in essential services, with unprotected areas facing an average annual cut of 0.4%. Secondly, austerity policies extend recessions, as seen in several European countries, and can ultimately create a bigger fiscal hole. Thirdly, austerity is unfair to citizens, as it increases inequality and poverty levels. Fourthly, austerity results in lower growth and a fall in living standards for many countries. Finally, austerity leads to lower job creation, with more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. The impact is felt more by women who face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment, and austerity measures further reinforce these barriers. Overall, the evidence presented shows that the adoption of an austerity regime is not a viable solution."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
    - Evidence 2: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
    - Evidence 2: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
    - Evidence 2: The budget deficit was 11% of GDP in 2009-10. It is now about 5.5% and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of UK predicts a surplus by the end of the decade..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
","The debate topic is whether or not we should adopt an austerity regime. Supporters of austerity argue that it has several benefits. Firstly, austerity can improve economic measures as shown by research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina, who demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity’. Secondly, austerity is important in the long term, as some economists argue that cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy. Thirdly, austerity can increase stability by compressing domestic demand and expanding exports, which was demonstrated by the German model of adjustment in Ireland. Fourthly, austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts as seen in the UK's plan to achieve a budget surplus and declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade. Lastly, austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times, as seen in the successful model of austerity in the US between 1920 and 1921 and several European countries that turned to austerity during the global economic downturn in 2008."

- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..
    - Evidence 2: The report also criticized the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship; they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'..
- claim_2: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
","The debate topic is whether we should adopt atheism, and opponents argue against it with two main claims. Firstly, they argue that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion, citing evidence such as Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 and the criticism of atheism in the Russian dictatorship. Secondly, opponents argue that people should choose for themselves whether atheism should be adopted, and provide evidence such as the freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs and the idea that choosing God or no God is a matter of personal choice with no scientific proof either way."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
    - Evidence 2: I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 2: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 2: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
    - Evidence 2: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
","The debate topic is whether we should adopt atheism. The positive supporters of this stance argue that there are several reasons to support atheism. Firstly, atheists are free from religious confusions and do not have to fight their own religious concepts. This provides them with the advantage of not having to worry about their privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever they are doing and thinking. Secondly, atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists. Atheist Michael Scriven insists that atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence.

We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
    - Evidence 2: Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
    - Evidence 2: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
","The opponents of adopting libertarianism argue that it has several negative consequences. Firstly, they claim that libertarianism harms economic growth by ignoring market failures and justifying government intervention in the economy. Secondly, they argue that libertarianism harms minorities and those who are worse off by prioritizing the negative liberties of the rich over the basic needs of the poor. Thirdly, they argue that libertarianism is unjust and non-equal by failing to address market failures and resulting in unequal outcomes. Fourthly, they argue that libertarianism removes essential laws, infrastructure, and government services, particularly with regards to environmental protection. Lastly, they argue that the government is essential to protect the rights of citizens, particularly with regards to the protection of human rights and the environment."

    - Evidence 2: James Shikwati (born 1970) is a Kenyan libertarian economist and Director of the Inter Region Economic Network who promotes freedom of trade as the driving solution to poverty in Africa..
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to freely associate with others, a libertarian system can promote greater cooperation, understanding, and social support. For example, sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters..
","The topic of the debate is whether we should adopt libertarianism. The supporters of libertarianism argue that it has numerous benefits, such as increasing economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfilment, and individual freedom/liberties. The first argument is that libertarianism increases economic growth, as reduced taxation leads to financial freedom and prosperity. James Shikwati, a libertarian economist, promotes freedom of trade as the solution to poverty in Africa. The second argument is that libertarianism increases freedom in the political system by protecting property rights, which are fundamental to individual freedom and a just society. Libertarians believe that emphasizing individual freedom and property rights allows individuals to pursue their goals and interests. The third argument is that libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment by promoting social networks and community involvement, which are important factors in well-being and happiness. Libertarianism also allows individuals to pursue their own interests and goals, leading to happiness. The fourth argument is that libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties. Libertarians support maximum liberty in personal and economic matters. Self-ownership is the only alternative to owning another group of people or having no ownership over oneself. Libertarianism supports the self-ownership principle as it is axiomatic and universal. Therefore, adopting libertarianism can have numerous benefits in various aspects of society."

    - Evidence 2: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. By creating human cells and tissues that are specific to an individual, researchers can better understand the effects of new treatments and drugs on human health. For example, a study by the National Institutes of Health found that human tissue cloning can help to reduce the need for animal testing..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is free of genetic diseases that are present in one of the parents. A study by the New England Journal of Medicine found that cloning can help to reduce the transmission of genetic diseases..
    - Evidence 2: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility.
- claim_3: Cloning promotes health.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of infertility and to develop new therapies to treat infertility. A study by the Fertility and Sterility journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the processes of reproduction..
    - Evidence 2: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of aging and to develop new therapies to slow or reverse the aging process. A study by the Aging Cell journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the process of aging..
- claim_4: Cloning promotes science/research.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, cloning can be used to study the genetic makeup of extinct species and to better understand the processes that led to their extinction. A study by the Journal of Evolutionary Biology found that cloning can help to better understand the process of evolution..
    - Evidence 2: For example, cloning can be used to produce genetically modified organisms that can be used for a range of applications, such as producing new medicines and improving agricultural production. A study by the Nature Biotechnology journal found that cloning can help to advance biotechnology..
","The opponents of banning human cloning argue that cloning has various benefits that can improve medical research, reduce animal testing, and even help couples struggling with infertility. Cloning can also be used to create a child who is free of genetic diseases that are present in one of the parents or genetically related to one of the parents. Furthermore, cloning can help scientists study the genetic basis of infertility, aging, and evolution, which can lead to the development of new therapies and understandings. Lastly, cloning can be used to produce genetically modified organisms for various applications. Therefore, the opponents of banning human cloning argue that it should not be banned due to the potential benefits it offers."
We should ban human cloning,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2001, when Germany and France proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an international convention to ban reproductive human cloning, the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included Spain, Philippines, the United States, and Costa Rica, noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning..
    - Evidence 2: Hwang himself criticised the process, stating that it did not bring science any closer to human cloning and the complexities, coupled with the low success rate (one in 123), did not make it ethical to clone family pets..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
    - Evidence 2: The Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and saw the alleged clone baby as an aberration..
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report published by the Council of Europe in 2008 discussed the potential for abuse of cloning technology and recommended measures to ensure that cloning is used for medical purposes only..
    - Evidence 2: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
","The debate topic is whether or not human cloning should be banned. The positive supporters argue that cloning should be banned for four main reasons. Firstly, cloning is not yet understood enough, and societies that tolerate cloning risk becoming desensitized to the ethical implications of such a practice. Additionally, the creation of clones, human-animal hybrids, or bioroids could result in the manufacturing and enslavement of unnatural beings. Secondly, cloning is deemed unethical and anti-religious by many. The Vatican and other religious organizations have spoken out against cloning, and some argue that it disrupts the natural familial order. Thirdly, cloning is considered unnatural, as it separates procreation from the traditional family unit. Finally, cloning is unsafe and can lead to many health problems and genetic abnormalities in the cloned individual. Reports have recommended measures to ensure cloning is used for medical purposes only, and studies have shown a low success rate for cloning animals. Based on these arguments, it is believed that human cloning should be banned."

    - Evidence 1: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
    - Evidence 2: In 1997, he published a pseudo-autobiographical novel called The Mao Game about a fifteen-year-old child star attempting to cope with heroin addiction, memories of past sexual abuse, and the impending death of his grandmother, who has been diagnosed with cancer..
","The debate topic is whether or not we should ban the use of child actors. The supporters of this motion argue that child performers are harmed by their work, at risk of exploitation, losing their childhood, have a lot of pressure, and tend to develop problems later in life.

We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 2: High-Value Enemy Combatant Defined.--In this section, the term  ``high-value enemy combatant'' means an enemy combatant who--(1) is a senior member of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group; (2) has knowledge of an imminent terrorist threat against the United States or its territories, the Armed Forces of the United States, the people or organizations of the United States, or an ally of the United States;  (3) has, or has had, direct involvement in planning or preparing a terrorist action against the United States or an ally of the United States or in assisting the leadership of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group in  planning or preparing such a terrorist action; or (4) if released from detention, would constitute a clear and continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the United States..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..

We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 2: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 2: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher..
    - Evidence 2: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 2: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
    - Evidence 2: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld later approved interrogation techniques in Guantánamo that included sleep deprivation, stress positions, nudity, sensory deprivation and threatening detainees with dogs..
","The debate topic is whether or not Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed. The positive supporters argue that the camp should be closed for several reasons. Firstly, detainees have the right to a trial in US courts, which has been established by the US supreme court. Secondly, the camp harms the US image and reputation and serves as a recruiting tool for terrorists. Thirdly, the camp is a symbol of discrimination and injustice. Fourthly, it is expensive to operate, with estimates of around $2.7 million per prisoner in 2013. Fifthly, personnel at the camp have committed crimes against prisoners, including physical abuse and torture. Lastly, unjust treatment and tactics are used in the camp, including sleep deprivation, stress positions, and sexual assault. Overall, the positive supporters believe that closing the camp is necessary to uphold human rights and justice, improve the US image, and save costs."

    - Evidence 1: As historian Roger Wilkins has pointed out, Blacks have a 375-year history on this continent: 245 involving slavery, 100 involving legalized discrimination, and only 30 involving anything else (Wilkins, 1995). Jews and Asians, on the other hand, have immigrated to North America—often as doctors, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs, and so forth. Moreover, European Jews are able to function as part of the White majority. To expect Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians is to deny the historical and social reality that Black people face..

    - Evidence 2: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
","The opponents of ending affirmative action make three main claims. Firstly, affirmative action boosts diversity as Asian students benefit from exposure to a diverse student body. Secondly, affirmative action is necessary to compensate for past discrimination and persecution faced by black people, while other groups such as Jews and Asians have had a different historical experience. Lastly, affirmative action reduces discrimination by correcting past policies and addressing existing discrimination, as demonstrated by the case of Johnson v. Transportation Agency."

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
    - Evidence 2: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university..
","The topic of the debate is whether affirmative action should be ended. The positive supporters argue that affirmative action should be ended because it diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. The first argument is that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, as Asian-American students are marked down on "
We should end mandatory retirement,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should end mandatory retirement', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: A mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019 found that mandatory retirement ages can stimulate economic growth, as younger workers are given more opportunities to enter the workforce and contribute to economic activity..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the International Labour Organization in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people, as older workers are encouraged to leave the workforce and make room for younger workers..
","As opponents of ending mandatory retirement, we argue that having a mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers. According to a study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019, mandatory retirement ages can stimulate economic growth. This is because younger workers are given more opportunities to enter the workforce and contribute to economic activity. Additionally, a report by the International Labour Organization in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people, as older workers are encouraged to leave the workforce and make room for younger workers. Therefore, we believe that ending mandatory retirement may lead to decreased opportunities for younger workers and could harm overall economic growth."

    - Evidence 1: Commercial airline pilots in the United States have a mandatory retirement age of 65, having increased from age 60 in 2007 [REF]..
    - Evidence 2: As a successful businessman, Greene implemented innovative employment policies, barring mandatory retirement age, actively recruiting the differently abled, and providing profit sharing at his own manufacturing facility ..
- claim_2: A mandatory retirement age harms the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the International Monetary Fund in 2019 found that mandatory retirement ages can limit labor market flexibility, as older workers are forced to retire, reducing the flexibility of the workforce and limiting the ability of employers to respond to changing economic conditions..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can lead to an inefficient use of human capital, as older workers with valuable skills and experience are forced to retire..
- claim_3: A mandatory retirement is not fair/discriminatory.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that mandatory retirement ages can promote intergenerational inequity, as older workers are forced to retire, reducing the diversity of skills and experiences available in the workplace and limiting opportunities for intergenerational collaboration..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Harvard Business Review in 2017 found that mandatory retirement ages can decrease older workers' sense of purpose, as they are forced to retire, regardless of their desire to continue contributing to the workforce..
- claim_4: A mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The Impact of Mandatory Retirement on Social Connections and Loneliness by Linda George, published in The Gerontologist, found that mandatory retirement can lead to decreased social connections and increased feelings of loneliness, both of which can negatively impact quality of life..
    - Evidence 2: The Impact of Mandatory Retirement on Psychological Well-Being by John Mi all and Catherine Weinberger, published in the Journal of Gerontology, found that mandatory retirement leads to decreased psychological well-being..
- claim_5: We should let everyone retire when they are ready.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready can reduce the risk of poverty in old age, as older workers can continue to earn an income, reducing their dependence on social security and pension benefits..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging, as older workers can continue to contribute to the workforce, using their skills and experience to benefit society..
","The debate topic is about whether we should end mandatory retirement. Supporters of ending mandatory retirement argue that it decreases institutional knowledge and harms the economy. Studies by the International Monetary Fund and the International Labour Organization found that mandatory retirement ages can limit labor market flexibility and lead to inefficient use of human capital. Additionally, mandatory retirement is not fair and can decrease the quality of life for those forced to retire. Instead, they argue that everyone should be able to retire when they are ready, as it can reduce the risk of poverty in old age and support active aging. Furthermore, studies have shown that allowing older workers to continue working can benefit society by using their skills and experience. A case study was cited in support of the argument, where a businessman implemented innovative employment policies by barring mandatory retirement age, actively recruiting differently-abled workers, and providing profit sharing."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..
","As the proponents of the abolition of nuclear weapons, we reject the idea that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. While opponents may argue that deterrence has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years, we would like to remind them of the numerous close calls and incidents that have brought us to the brink of nuclear war. One such example is the Cuban Missile Crisis, where the world was on the verge of a nuclear war due to the possession of nuclear weapons by both the US and the Soviet Union. This highlights the inherent danger and instability of a world where nuclear weapons exist.

Furthermore, opponents may argue that the invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as the country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. However, we would like to remind them of the devastating effects that even a single nuclear weapon could have on a nation, as seen in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The possession of nuclear weapons only increases the chances of such destruction, as well as the risk of accidental use, intentional use, or theft by non-state actors.

In conclusion, we strongly believe that the abolition of nuclear weapons is crucial for the survival of humanity. We cannot afford to continue living in a world where the threat of nuclear war hangs over our heads. We must work towards a world where nuclear weapons are eliminated, and diplomacy and cooperation are prioritized to ensure lasting peace."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
    - Evidence 2: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
    - Evidence 2: David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack. Additionally, the fact that it happened so recently highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago..
","The supporters argue that we should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons. They have put forth two claims to support their stance. Firstly, they assert that nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands, and this is a cause of concern. The evidence provided in support of this claim includes the theft or loss of nuclear materials that are not going away, and more states are interested in developing them. The second claim put forth is that nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action. The evidence provided in support of this claim suggests that when tensions escalate, unfortunate coincidences can conspire to create significant problems, and we were very lucky to get through the Cuban Missile Crisis. Additionally, the fact that we lost contact with 50 missiles highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
    - Evidence 2: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
    - Evidence 2: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
","The opponents argue that we should not fight urbanization because cities offer more opportunities, benefits the economy, and benefits the environment. They provide evidence to support each claim. For instance, they argue that during Japan's economic development, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Moreover, urbanization leads to economic growth due to scale, technological developments, and diversity of both products and occupations. The opponents also argue that urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies and brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Thus, they conclude that urbanization should not be fought."
We should fight urbanization,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..
    - Evidence 2: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: What is certain is that the crime rate certainly rose during the period of industrialisation, particularly in towns and cities..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid urbanisation and growing population have increased criminal activities in Bopal & Ghuma..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Surveys showed that urbanization and coastal development, especially from tourism and agricultural sectors, contributed to increased degradation of the marine environment in the area..
    - Evidence 2: A specific concern is urbanization, which affects water quality by increasing its load of metals and organic contaminants..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and good-quality touristic services, so the fast process of urbanization, had the consequence of irregular neighbourhoods..
    - Evidence 2: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..

We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
    - Evidence 2: Citizens have the right to choose whether they want to vote. Compulsion is part of a slippery slope to totalitarianism..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
","The opponents of introducing compulsory voting present three main arguments against the idea. Firstly, abstaining from voting is also a way of reflecting one's preferences. Herbert Spencer argued that abstaining from voting means that one does not consent to the rule of the winning candidate. Abstaining can also be used to indicate ambivalence or mild disapproval of a measure. Secondly, citizens have a right not to vote, and compulsory voting is a breach of civil liberties. Compulsion can lead to a slippery slope towards totalitarianism. Thirdly, compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner, which can have a detrimental effect on the civic engagement and skew election results. It can also encourage politicians to use sensational and misleading advertising to appeal to less informed voters."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 2: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 2: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..
","The debate topic is whether we should introduce compulsory voting. The positive supporters of this stance provide three main arguments to support their position. Firstly, they argue that compulsory voting increases representation. Countries like the United States have experienced lower turnout from poorer and less educated people, leading to a skewed political system. Compulsory voting would ensure that candidates address the needs of all voters. Secondly, they suggest that compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. This is because it increases the legitimacy of elected representatives and the political education of the people. Lastly, they claim that people have an obligation to vote. Voter turnout in countries where voting is compulsory, like Thailand, is not much of a problem. People who can vote but don't are taking their right to vote for granted, as it is one of the most important rights we have. Therefore, the positive supporters of compulsory voting argue that it is necessary to increase representation, political engagement, and fulfill our civic duty to vote."
We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the Board representative is quoted as having said that we might end up in the next 10 or 20 years with our psychiatric hospitals filled with people who have problems with cannabis, and that a recent study by the British Lung Foundation found smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes..
    - Evidence 2: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
    - Evidence 2: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs..
    - Evidence 2: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 2: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..
","The opponents of legalizing cannabis put forward four claims to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that cannabis harms the body, as studies have shown that smoking cannabis can cause damage to the airways and impaired psychomotor skills. Secondly, opponents claim that cannabis increases lack of judgement and accidents, with research showing a rise in fatal car crashes involving cannabis consumption. Thirdly, opponents claim that cannabis is a gateway drug that can lead to addiction, with studies suggesting that early cannabis smokers are more likely to move on to harder drugs. Lastly, opponents argue that legalizing cannabis can lead to it getting into the hands of underage teenagers and children, citing Alaska's experience where legalization led to higher usage rates among teens."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
    - Evidence 2: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
    - Evidence 2: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
    - Evidence 2: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
","The debate topic is whether cannabis should be legalized, and the supporters of its legalization present several arguments. First, they argue that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs, yet they remain legal. They provide evidence that many illicit drugs pose fewer health risks than certain legal drugs, and the risks from cannabis use are overstated. Legalizing marijuana for adults on the same terms as alcohol would reduce crime and possibly reduce alcohol consumption. Second, they argue that legalizing cannabis is financially beneficial. They provide evidence that legalizing cannabis could save money in law enforcement costs and generate tax revenue. Third, they argue that cannabis is safe and can have medical benefits. They point out that the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis is inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine. Fourth, they argue that if cannabis were legalized, it could be regulated, which would allow for selective social control and reduce its popularity among young people. Fifth, they argue that legalizing cannabis would reduce black-market and criminal activity. They cite a study that found drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and argue that treating drug use as a health issue rather than criminalizing people could reduce crime and improve health."
We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
    - Evidence 2: Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
    - Evidence 2: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..

    - Evidence 1: Research conducted by Giobbe (1993) found similarities in the behaviour of pimps and batterers, in particular, through their use of enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse, attitudes of ownership, and extreme physical violence..
    - Evidence 2: A survey of female sex workers in Leeds, England, and Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland, revealed that 30% had been slapped, punched or kicked by a client while working, 13% had been beaten, 11% had been raped and 22% had experienced an attempted rape..
","The opponents argue against the legalization of prostitution by presenting three claims and providing evidence to support their arguments. Firstly, they argue that legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases, citing studies that state that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population. Secondly, they argue that legalizing sex work will increase immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking, as evidenced by substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes. Additionally, they provide a report that concludes that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing. Finally, opponents argue that legalizing sex work will increase violence against women, citing research conducted by Giobbe that found similarities in the behavior of pimps and batterers, and a survey of female sex workers in Leeds, England, and Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland, revealed that a significant percentage had experienced violence."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
    - Evidence 2: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 2: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 2: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..
    - Evidence 2: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
","The debate topic is whether prostitution should be legalized, and its positive supporters have presented five arguments to support their stance. The first argument is that legalizing sex work boosts the economy, citing historical examples and the benefits of taxable income. The second argument is that legalizing sex work increases benefits for sex workers, including health care and safe sex measures. The third argument is that legalizing sex work allows for regulation of the profession, leading to safer and revenue-generating brothels. The fourth argument is that legalizing sex work makes the profession safer for women, with examples of successful prevention interventions and decriminalization in New Zealand. Finally, the fifth argument is that sex work is a valid choice over one's body, with sex workers viewing it as a profession and a way of making money. These arguments are supported by a range of evidence, including historical examples, public health research, and surveys of sex workers."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
    - Evidence 2: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
    - Evidence 2: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
    - Evidence 2: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
","The opponents of legalizing sex selection present three main claims. Firstly, sex selection can lead to gender imbalance as evidenced by the 140 million missing women globally and the rise in sex selection in certain areas, leading to a damaging effect on societies. Secondly, sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases as it allows parents to choose the gender of their child and act like "
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 2: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 2: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
","The debate topic is about legalizing sex selection and the positive supporters have presented several arguments. Firstly, they argue that it is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child. The advantage of selecting the gender of the baby in advance is that parents are able to plan for their family, ensuring that they have an adequate number of children to raise and can provide them with good education and proper nutrition. Additionally, it can also prevent gender-specific diseases from being passed onto the baby. Secondly, sex selection allows for better family planning as it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. Moreover, this technology gives parents the opportunity to have a child of the gender they desire and helps them complete their family. Thirdly, sex selection makes the family more happy/complete, and is especially helpful for parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth. Fourthly, sex selection prevents diseases in the child. Lastly, it is argued that sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide as it gives intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer. Overall, the positive supporters of legalizing sex selection argue that it is a desirable scenario and offers many benefits."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
    - Evidence 2: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
    - Evidence 2: Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment..
","The opponents of prohibiting flag burning argue that it is an effective tool of expression, protest, and critique. They provide evidence that burning the flag is considered symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment. For example, in the case of Gregory Lee Johnson, the court ruled in favor of him because burning the flag was a form of expression and his protest was sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment. Additionally, opponents argue that flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression, and the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea offensive or disagreeable. Justice William Brennan supports this argument in his majority opinion, stating that burning the flag is considered an expressive activity protected by the First Amendment. While flag desecration may be offensive to many, it is an essential form of free speech that should not be prohibited."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
    - Evidence 2: In Austria flag desecration is illegal under Â§248 Strafgesetzbuch..
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
","The topic for the debate is 'We should prohibit flag burning'. Those who support the prohibition of flag burning have put forth two main claims to support their stance. The first claim is that flags are important symbols that should be respected. They argue that just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Evidence supporting this claim includes the fact that in Austria, flag desecration is illegal under Â§248 Strafgesetzbuch. The second claim is that flag burning is an inflammatory act. Supporters of this claim state that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed. They point out that according to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
    - Evidence 2: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
    - Evidence 2: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 2: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 2: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
    - Evidence 2: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
","The topic of the debate is whether or not women should be prohibited from serving in combat. The opponents argue against this stance with several claims. First, they argue for gender equality, as women have shown to have important contributions to society and benefit from equal rights. Second, they argue that women are an asset in combat, as physical strength is becoming less important and women have proven to have unique skills and strategies. Third, they claim that women can overcome physical differences and be just as capable in combat as men. Fourth, they argue that women should have the choice to serve in combat if they pass the necessary tests. Finally, they provide evidence to support the idea that women can perform equally to men in combat roles, and that there are new fitness standards that ensure gender neutrality in the selection process."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 2: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
    - Evidence 2: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
    - Evidence 2: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
    - Evidence 2: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
    - Evidence 2: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
","The debate topic is whether women should be prohibited in combat, and the positive supporters of this stance put forth five claims to support their argument. 

Firstly, they claim that men are better suited for combat than women due to physical differences that can hinder women in combat. They provide evidence from a Marine Corps study that found all-male units to be faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. They also argue that the military is lowering fitness standards to accommodate female soldiers, which is detrimental to the institution as a whole.

Secondly, they argue that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers in combat. They cite evidence that the US Army is considering reversing gender-neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. They also mention that nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short in the Army Combat Fitness Test, which raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women.

Thirdly, they claim that women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. They provide evidence that mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have grave consequences, and that fraternization between male and female soldiers can undermine unit cohesion, morale, teamwork, and operational effectiveness.

Fourthly, they argue that women should serve in safer roles. They mention that in the Israeli Defense Forces, fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions, and that women are concentrated in combat support. They also argue that women have a naturally nurturing disposition and that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless.

Finally, they claim that women soldiers' capture is a big concern. They argue that women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men, making them less consistent and dependable in tough situations. They provide evidence that every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped, including a female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg.

Overall, the positive supporters of prohibiting women in combat present a range of arguments and evidence to support their stance, citing physical differences, fitness standards, distraction, safety, and capture concerns as reasons why women should not serve in combat roles."
We should subsidize journalism,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Government intervention has the risk of inserting bias/harming objectivity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It’s just wrong. If government funds, government will regulate. Freedom of the press has to include freedom for the press to fail..
    - Evidence 2: Political endorsements create more opportunities to construe favoritism in reporting, and can create a perceived conflict of interest..
","The opponents of the proposition that we should subsidize journalism argue that government intervention in this matter carries a significant risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. This is supported by the argument that if the government funds journalism, they will inevitably seek to regulate it, which could undermine the freedom of the press. In addition, political endorsements could create the appearance of favoritism in reporting, which can create a perceived conflict of interest and further erode the public's trust in journalism. Overall, opponents believe that government subsidy of journalism would be a harmful interference that could ultimately damage the credibility and integrity of the press."
We should subsidize journalism,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: When news media lost a sizable percentage of their advertising revenues in the pandemic, state subsidies became more important than ever in securing the financial viability of media markets..
    - Evidence 2: Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting..
- claim_2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In the words of a 2011 report from the Oxford School for the Study of Journalism and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, Mainstream media is the lifeblood of topical social media conversations in the UK..
    - Evidence 2: MacLean argues that education in journalism helps empower members of the public to understand how media work..
- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..
    - Evidence 2: The IPD journalism program helps strengthen journalists' economic literacy and equips them to report and write about the major economic issues confronting developing economies..
","The debate topic is whether we should subsidize journalism, and the positive supporters argue that it is important to do so. The first claim is that a subsidy is important to make journalism viable, which is supported by evidence such as the loss of advertising revenues during the pandemic, leading to the need for state subsidies. Additionally, WikiLeaks is seen as filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism, and support for WikiLeaks is motivated by declining funding and resources for investigative reporting. 

The second claim is that journalism is important to information-spreading and accountability, supported by evidence such as mainstream media being the lifeblood of topical social media conversations in the UK, and education in journalism helping to empower members of the public to understand how media works. 

The third claim is that subsidies will increase the quality of journalism, which is supported by evidence such as the European Union providing subsidies to encourage new entrants and small players to compete against powerful incumbents, leading to a media-plural Europe that facilitates democratic decision-making. Furthermore, the IPD journalism program helps strengthen journalists' economic literacy and equips them to report and write about the major economic issues confronting developing economies."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 2: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
    - Evidence 2: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
    - Evidence 2: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..
    - Evidence 2: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
","The opponents argue that space exploration should not be subsidized because it can be carried out by the private sector, it is expensive, ineffective, and there are more important issues to fund. They provide evidence that private companies such as Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX have partnered with government agencies like NASA to expand space exploration rapidly. Moreover, space exploration is costly, difficult, harsh, perilous, and risky, costing billions of dollars annually. The opponents argue that space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution, and missions to other planets and interstellar space do not contribute to life on Earth. Finally, there are a number of ways to spend the annual budget of $19.3 billion, such as funding education, healthcare, or addressing global warming, crime rates, or finding a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the opponents argue that space exploration should not be subsidized, and the money and effort could be better used to solve more important problems."
We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
    - Evidence 2: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
    - Evidence 2: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
    - Evidence 2: Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites – which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path – to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: space exploration, investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches of the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity..
    - Evidence 2: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..
","The debate topic is whether we should subsidize space exploration. Those in favor argue that space exploration can help colonize resources on other planets, improve science and technology, and is financially beneficial. They also argue that it is necessary for the survival of humanity and unravels information about the universe. Evidence to support these claims includes the potential to drive down the cost of data through satellite broadband, the need for technology capable of recycling resources for current and future space exploration missions, and the contributions of space investigations to understanding the universe."
We should subsidize vocational education,-1.0,chatgpt,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize vocational education', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 found that subsidizing vocational education may have limited benefits for the economy, as many programs may not provide the skills and knowledge that workers need to succeed in the 21st century..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the National Science Board in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education may not ensure quality, as many programs may not meet standards for curriculum, instruction, and assessment..
- claim_2: subsidizing vocational education is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be limited by the ability to scale, as many programs may not have the resources or infrastructure to serve large numbers of students..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the National Skills Coalition in 2019 found that subsidizing vocational education can reduce funding for other important programs, such as financial aid, student support services, and research and development..
- claim_3: subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The study analyzed the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany and found that the subsidies led to an increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs. This suggests that subsidies for vocational education can influence student choice and lead to an influx in those fields..
    - Evidence 2: The study found that subsidies for vocational education in Germany led to a significant increase in employment in the relevant fields. This suggests that subsidizing vocational education can lead to an influx of workers in those professions..
- claim_4: vocational education is not a good career choice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Education Trust in 2016 found that many vocational education programs do not provide adequate support for non-college bound students, including counseling, mentoring, and other resources that can help them succeed in the workforce..
","The opponents of subsidizing vocational education have several arguments against this proposal. Firstly, they argue that this will divert money from more worthy causes. Evidence suggests that many vocational education programs may not provide the necessary skills and knowledge for workers to succeed in the 21st century. Secondly, opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education is expensive and may reduce funding for other important programs. Studies show that scaling vocational education programs can be limited, and subsidies can lead to a reduction in financial aid, student support services, and research and development. Thirdly, opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions. Evidence suggests that subsidies can influence student choice and lead to an increase in enrollment and employment in relevant fields. Finally, opponents argue that vocational education is not a good career choice, as it often does not provide opportunities for advancement or adequate support for non-college bound students."

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
    - Evidence 2: In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person's 'mental state is .. of paramount importance.'.
    - Evidence 3: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 4: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: .   They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 5: A qualitative study using narrative interviews was conducted throughout the UK. Results shows that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most people. Those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a right. Some had multiple reasons, including pain and anticipated pain, fear of indignity, loss of control and cognitive impairment. Those who did not want to be a burden also had other reasons for wanting euthanasia. Suicide was contemplated by a few, who would have preferred a change in the law to allow them to end their lives with medical help and in the company of family or friends..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient..
    - Evidence 2: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 3: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
    - Evidence 2: In 2002, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide. This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances..
    - Evidence 3: The use of Advanced Decisions can help significantly but they also believe that if a right to an Assisted Death is available then the very knowledge of this fact can alleviate many of the worries an individual might have..
    - Evidence 4: Those who witness others die are 'particularly convinced' that the law should be changed to allow assisted death..
    - Evidence 5: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A September 2010 Irish Times poll showed that a majority, 57% of adults, believed that doctor-assisted suicide should be legal for terminally ill patients who request it..
    - Evidence 2: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
    - Evidence 3: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 4: Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned..
    - Evidence 5: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
","The debate centers on whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offense or not. Opponents of the criminalization of assisted suicide present several arguments to support their position. Firstly, they argue that assisted suicide gives dignity to the person who wants to commit it. They cite evidence that the concept of dignity suits the intuitions that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death. Secondly, opponents argue that assisted suicide reduces suffering. They provide examples of countries where assisted suicide is legal and report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally. Thirdly, opponents argue that people should have the freedom to choose to end their life. They cite examples of countries such as the Netherlands where euthanasia, including physician-assisted suicide, is legal. Lastly, opponents argue that the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide. They provide evidence that a majority of adults believe that doctor-assisted suicide should be legal for terminally ill patients who request it. Overall, opponents of the criminalization of assisted suicide present a strong case based on the principles of dignity, reduced suffering, freedom, and benefit to the terminally ill."

    - Evidence 1: As of 2014 assisted suicide remains illegal in Ireland..
    - Evidence 2: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
    - Evidence 3: In 1997, in the cases of Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it..
    - Evidence 4: In 1994, a suit was filed in New York claiming that the anti-assisted suicide statute was a violation of equal protection and liberty guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. This claim was rejected by the District Court on the basis that there is no right to assisted suicide given by the U.S. Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
    - Evidence 2: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..

","The debate topic is whether assisted suicide should be a criminal offense. The supporters of this stance have presented five claims with supporting evidence. Firstly, they argue that assisted suicide can be solicited for personal benefit, as it is only allowed for those in a state of constant and unbearable suffering. Secondly, they argue that people can still get better and therefore assisted suicide should not be allowed. Thirdly, they claim that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role as a healer and is too dangerous to make doctors agents of a patient's death. Fourthly, they argue that people do not have the right to self-harm/harm others, citing cases and statutes where assisted suicide remains illegal.

Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The agency provides Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
    - Evidence 2: Gallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001..
    - Evidence 3: The agency provides Lebanon School District, charter schools, the district's home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 3: “Differentiation is what homeschooling is all about,” Sherry Bushnell told me. She and herhusband founded the National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, an internationalorganization that supports parents who educate special-needs children at home. They homeschool their sonJordan, a 13-year-old boy with Down's syndrome, along with his nine siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
    - Evidence 5: The efficiency of homeschooling – and the fact that you don’t have to follow the national curriculum or the typical timings of a school day – leaves you with time to spend broadening your child’s learning. You can make time for play, projects, real experiments, and the arts. Real-life skill building – including cooking, cleaning, volunteering, and learning to budget – could form a part of your school day. You could also choose to learn in different places, like museums, parks, and science centres..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.

Franklin commented that public schools are a 'sinking ship' and he believed that private and home schooling are a better alternative for Georgia..
    - Evidence 2: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 3: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.

","The opponents of banning homeschooling argue that it is often the best option for catering to the needs of exceptional, religious, ill, and disabled students. Homeschooling can be personalized to the child's pace and needs, allowing for a deeper understanding of their education progress and liberty to explore their own family's culture. Additionally, mainstream schools have a lot of violence and bullying, and parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children. The home is also a good learning environment, where students can have a more active learning experience and enjoy a broader socialization than in a typical classroom. Therefore, homeschooling should not be banned."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Unschooling contrasts with other forms of home education in that the student's education is not directed by a teacher and curriculum..
    - Evidence 2: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 3: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 4: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although we acknowledged in the advantages section that homeschooled children do still develop socially, they naturally lose some interaction by spending more time at home. They may be out of touch with their peers, have fewer friends, and have less experience interacting with people from different backgrounds. Their view of the world could be very narrow and biased. In the worst cases, they could be brought up to be intolerant and misinformed, with little knowledge of general societal values. This could disadvantage them in the future..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 3: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse..
    - Evidence 2: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 3: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 4: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..

","The debate topic is 'Homeschooling should be banned'. Those who support the ban argue for four claims. Firstly, they argue that homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized, as evidenced by the lack of regulation in some states leading to shoddy homeschooling and potential abuse. Secondly, mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills and provide experiences such as work opportunities, sports leagues, and recognition that homeschooling cannot offer. Thirdly, mainstream schools are of higher educational quality, as the state's regulation ensures it. Fourthly, parents are not qualified as teachers and may shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse, give students a one-sided point of view, and require the parent to take on additional roles as teacher and administrator, leading to stress and fatigue. Overall, supporters of the ban on homeschooling believe that it is not a viable option for providing a quality education and may lead to potential harm to children."

- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Two to three million deaths are prevented each year worldwide by vaccination, and an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if all recommended vaccines were used..
    - Evidence 2: In the twentieth century, there were 16,316 deaths from polio and 29,004 deaths from smallpox yearly in the United States; in 2012 there were no reported cases of polio or smallpox..
    - Evidence 3: Diphtheria killed 21,053 people yearly, measles killed 530,217 people yearly, mumps killed 162,344 people yearly, rubella killed 47,745 people yearly, and Hib killed 20,000 people yearly in the twentieth century United States; by 2012 each of these diseases were decreased by 99% because of vaccinations..
    - Evidence 4: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
    - Evidence 5: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that vaccination prevents 3.5–5 million deaths per year, and up to 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination.
    - Evidence 2: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 3: According to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization, vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, which equates to roughly 285 children saved every hour..
    - Evidence 4: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..
    - Evidence 5: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 3: Those seeking to enforce compulsory vaccination argued that the public good overrode personal freedom, a view supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905, a landmark ruling which set a precedent for cases dealing with personal freedom and the public good..
    - Evidence 4: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
    - Evidence 5: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 3: As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant..
    - Evidence 4: Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries..
    - Evidence 5: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
    - Evidence 2: According to the World Health Organization (WHO): 'After observation of study populations for periods of up to 20 years in Japan and 10 years in the United States, more than 90% of immunocompetent persons who were vaccinated as children were still protected from varicella.'.
    - Evidence 3: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
    - Evidence 4: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..
    - Evidence 5: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..
","The topic of debate is whether routine child vaccinations should be mandatory. Those in support of mandatory vaccinations put forth the following arguments:

Firstly, routine child vaccinations are effective in preventing diseases. The evidence suggests that vaccinations have prevented millions of deaths each year worldwide, and diseases such as polio, smallpox, and diphtheria have been eliminated in the United States due to vaccinations. Additionally, vaccines have decreased the incidence of diseases like pneumococcal disease and measles by significant percentages.

Secondly, child vaccination saves lives. Vaccinations are estimated to prevent 3.5-5 million deaths per year worldwide and could save thousands of lives if all children in the US were fully vaccinated. Studies have shown that childhood immunization has prevented millions of illnesses, hospitalizations, and early deaths.

Thirdly, routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others. When the rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of diseases like measles typically no longer occur. Failure to vaccinate can lead to outbreaks that affect both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Additionally, compulsory vaccination can be seen as necessary for the public good, as shown by a landmark ruling of the US Supreme Court in 1905.

Fourthly, mandatory routine child vaccinations can prevent virus/disease spreading. Vaccination during pregnancy and among caregivers can reduce the risk of passing infections to infants, and vaccines like pertussis are effective in preventing illness. When vaccination rates are high, the incidence of outbreaks and deaths due to vaccine-preventable diseases decreases.

Lastly, children should not suffer from preventable diseases. Diseases like measles and Haemophilus influenzae can cause serious illness and even death, and vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality. Vaccine hesitancy has led to disease outbreaks and contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases worldwide.

Overall, the evidence suggests that mandatory routine child vaccinations are necessary to prevent diseases, save lives, and protect the public good."

    - Evidence 3: Another California legislation, Senate Bill No. 1001, was signed into law last September and will go into effect in July. It purports to address the role of bots in fake news and advertising. But the law’s definition of “bot” is too broad, and the method it uses is a poor match for the goal it seeks to accomplish..
    - Evidence 4: Legislation has a noticeable gap failing to hold the platform companies accountable for their management in data privacy, and calls to arms by legislators typically come after an identified breach yet quickly lose momentum..
    - Evidence 5: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..

It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.'.
    - Evidence 2: On October 18, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was scheduled to begin using personal information collected using social media platforms to screen immigrants arriving in the U.S. The department made this new measure known in a posting to the Federal Register in September 2017, noting that '...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results...' would be included in an applicant's immigration file. This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates..

It is not desirable because any process developed to address the problem cannot be made immune to political co-optation. '.
    - Evidence 3: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..

","The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. Opponents argue against this proposition with the following claims and supporting evidence. 

Firstly, opponents argue that social media regulation is not effective. They cite examples of failed regulation such as the FTC's failure to enforce its order to protect user privacy resulting in the transfer of user data, and TikTok's violation of children's privacy laws despite paying a fine. 

Secondly, opponents argue that social media regulation harms privacy, citing examples such as the use of social media monitoring software by the government to track individuals and the DHS collecting personal information from social media to screen immigrants arriving in the US. They also argue that intervening with or removing content can lead to censorship and violate freedom of expression and privacy rights. 

Thirdly, opponents argue that social media regulation harms freedom of speech and other democratic rights, warning that regulations could threaten freedom of expression and citing examples of regulations that have jeopardized human rights. They argue that intervening with or removing content can easily lead to censorship and limit freedom of expression. 

Opponents also argue that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, citing examples of excess bureaucracy and inefficiency created by government intervention in public goods and merit goods. They argue that government intervention in the market system can cause disruptions and extend recessions or depressions.

    - Evidence 3: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 4: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
    - Evidence 5: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Along those lines, Senator Amy Klobuchar has proposed legislation to have the National Science Foundation identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material..
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
    - Evidence 3: Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'We will not allow child sexual abuse, terrorist material and other harmful content to fester on online platforms. Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.'.
    - Evidence 4: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 5: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The dramatic story of the consulting agency Cambridge Analytica is a case in point. The firm exploited the private information of over 50 million Facebook users to influence the 2016 American presidential election..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 3: Another rising concern, exacerbated by Cambridge Analytica’s breach of Facebook data, centers on how bad actors access private data from social media platforms and elsewhere and use it to manipulate opinions for the benefit of a few..
    - Evidence 4: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..
    - Evidence 5: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
","The debate topic is about whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government. Supporters argue that social media regulation is necessary to protect younger audiences and prevent the spread of fake news, negative content, and malicious users. Social media platforms have been found to violate the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and cause poor mental health among youth. The spread of disinformation and fake news has resulted in a lack of trust in news organizations and manipulated opinions. Pending legislation seeks to make social media platforms more transparent and outlaw manipulative techniques. Social media regulation can also help to deal with negative content and malicious users who exploit private information. Overall, social media regulation is required to protect the public and restore trust in the tech industry."

    - Evidence 3: Over the summer, 76% of Republicans (including independents who lean to the party) felt the U.S. had done a good job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, compared with just 29% of those who do not identify with the Republican Party..
    - Evidence 4: Moreover, 77% of Americans said the country was now more divided than before the outbreak, as compared with a median of 47% in the 13 other nations surveyed..

- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
    - Evidence 2: As he accepted the Republican nomination for president, Donald Trump stated that “America is one of the highest-taxed countries in the world,” while promoting his tax cut proposal..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers estimate, for example, that 80 percent of families saw the share of budgets dedicated to spending on needs such as housing and health care increase by more than 7 percentage points between 1984 and 2014, potentially crowding out spending on other categories like leisure, longer-term investments in education, and saving for retirement..
    - Evidence 4: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
    - Evidence 5: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..

    - Evidence 4: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
    - Evidence 5: The United States’ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019—the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany—according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..

    - Evidence 5: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
","Opponents argue that the USA is not a good country to live in due to various reasons. They claim that the US has unfair health and education policies, citing studies that show white supremacy in the school curriculum and difficulty in affording healthcare costs. Additionally, they argue that the US has a problematic and divisive political system, with increasing disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on several issues. They also point out that the US has a negative culture, where hustle culture glorifies overworking and people prioritize their social status over the dignity of others. The opponents also claim that the US has high taxation and costs of living, with families living below the poverty line taxed at a higher rate than those making more money. Furthermore, the US is unequal, with high levels of poverty and wealth concentration among the top 10% of households. Opponents argue that the US is also unsafe, with high rates of gun deaths and concerns over violent crime. Lastly, opponents claim that the US is xenophobic and racist, with racial slurs and jokes directed towards Asian Americans and daily racialized trauma experienced by middle-class Blacks in predominantly white environments."

",The proponents of the topic 
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A leading participant in the Council, Eusebius of Caesarea, wrote: It is fitting that those in the priesthood and occupied in the service of God, should abstain after ordination from the intercourse of marriage..
    - Evidence 2: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
    - Evidence 3: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 4: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
    - Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gray held a series of councils in his diocese from 1241 to 1255 which endeavoured to enforce clerical celibacy, keep benefices from being inherited, and improve the education and morals of the clergy..
    - Evidence 2: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
    - Evidence 3: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 4: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption..
    - Evidence 5: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 3: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..

- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
    - Evidence 3: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..

    - Evidence 1: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
    - Evidence 2: Among the early Church statements on the topic of sexual continence and celibacy are the Directa and Cum in unum decretals of Pope Siricius (c. 385), which asserted that clerical sexual abstinence was an apostolic practice that must be followed by ministers of the church.
    - Evidence 3: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..

","The opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy argue that it allows priests to focus on God and their spiritual life, citing evidence such as the writings of Eusebius of Caesarea and Pope Paul VI. They also argue that celibacy is a strong religious belief with a long history in the Church, as evidenced by canon law and early Christian theologians like Origen. Furthermore, they assert that celibacy makes priests appear holy and that it is a choice that they willingly make, as supported by Paul's writings. They also argue that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained and that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, as evidenced by reports linking celibacy to instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church."
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)..
    - Evidence 2: George T. Dennis SJ of Catholic University of America says: 'There is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.' Peter Fink SJ agrees, saying that underlying premises used in the book, Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy, 'would not stand up so comfortably to historical scrutiny'. Dennis says this book provides no evidence that celibacy had apostolic origins..
    - Evidence 3: In 1874 Old Catholics removed the requirement of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: From its beginnings, the idea of clerical celibacy has been contested in canon courts, in theology, and in religious practices..
    - Evidence 5: Perhaps the most striking example is that in most Eastern Catholic Churches, ordination of married men to the priesthood is routine (although no priest may marry after ordination, and only celibate priests may become bishops)..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent..
    - Evidence 2: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
    - Evidence 3: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Protestant apologists further argue that clerical celibacy violates the Biblical teaching in the First Epistle to Timothy:. The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
    - Evidence 3: Men are driven by testosterone to want sex, says John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University. Women are driven to a lesser degree by a mixture of testosterone and oestrogen, he explains. ’I'd regard celibacy as a totally abnormal state.’ Around 80-90% of men masturbate and it's likely that priests do too, he says. There is data to suggest that men who ejaculate more are less prone to prostate cancer, he says. You could argue that it's not so healthy to be celibate..
    - Evidence 4: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Many Carpatho-Rusyns, including Varzaly, believed clerical celibacy to be so inherently unnatural as to lead inevitably to promiscuity and sexual abuse..
    - Evidence 2: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
    - Evidence 3: Ignoring his vow of celibacy, Urbain Grandier is known to have had sexual relationships with a number of women and to have acquired a reputation as a philanderer..

","The debate topic is whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned. The supporters of abandoning celibacy present several arguments. Firstly, they argue that celibacy is outdated, as evidenced by the fact that the requirement of clerical celibacy has been removed in some instances in history. Secondly, celibacy is too pressuring and difficult, as priests and nuns who are forced to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behavior have been known to suffer. Thirdly, celibacy is unhealthy and unnatural, as it violates Biblical teachings and goes against the natural drive to reproduce. Fourthly, celibacy can lead to wrong sexual behavior, as seen in the sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church. Finally, celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests, as some may not want to take the vow of celibacy. Overall, the supporters of abandoning celibacy argue that it is an outdated and problematic practice."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, a 2010 CDC study on child well-being and family structure shows that children from homes with married parents did better in every category..
    - Evidence 2: Research by the Institute for American Values shows that children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused, less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviors, have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager, and are less likely to be raised in poverty..
    - Evidence 3: Children raised in intact married families tend to earn higher grades than those in non-intact families.1) For example, kindergarten children from married families have higher reading scores than those from cohabiting families.2) Parents in always-intact married families are also more likely to help their children do their homework than are parents in stepfamilies or single-parent families,3) and fathers in always-intact married families are more involved in their children’s homework than are stepfathers.4) Compared with children in stable married families, students experiencing parental divorce have lower academic expectations and test scores.5).
    - Evidence 4: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 5: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization..
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church..
    - Evidence 3: Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually..
    - Evidence 4: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 5: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Evidence published by John Helliwell (and Shawn Grover) in the Journal of Happiness Studies finds that marriage makes people happier and that they continue to be more satisfied years into the marriage..
    - Evidence 2: Married people overall do better on virtually every indicator of health and well-being, says Robin Simon, a sociology professor and researcher at Wake Forest University. Even when they get sick, married people are more likely to recover..
    - Evidence 3: But while cohabitation is on the rise, data from Pew and other sources continue to show that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships. The marriage happiness premium extends to nearly every aspect of a couple's relationship, with one notable exception: their sex lives..
    - Evidence 4: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 5: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult. About eight-in-ten married adults (78%) say they feel closer to their spouse than to any other adult in their life; a narrower majority of cohabiters (55%) say the same about their partner..
    - Evidence 2: Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly..
    - Evidence 3: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult.
    - Evidence 4: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 5: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: One of the most significant advantages of marriage is eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits. First, as a married couple, you're each eligible to collect your own Social Security benefit or up to 50 percent of your spouse's benefit, whichever is greater. This can be a financial plus if one of you is a higher earner..
    - Evidence 2: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
    - Evidence 3: One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage..
    - Evidence 4: One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill..
    - Evidence 5: There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married..
",The opponents of the topic 
We should abandon marriage,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to CNN, dowry-related woman abuse in the country is often caused by dissatisfaction over the amount of dowry received, as it has become more of a condition of marriage, rather than a gift. Women are known to commit suicide, driven by the pressure of not being able to keep up with dowry payments, or they face violence within their marriage, or are murdered for the same reason..
    - Evidence 2: Millions of girls around the world experience female genital mutilation (FGM) as a prerequisite to marriage or as a means to control a woman’s sexuality before marriage. This is an infringement on a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy, and as it is often performed on school-aged girls, also stops them from being able to access education and deprives them of their childhood, as well as causing both short- and long-term health consequences..
    - Evidence 3: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
    - Evidence 4: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
    - Evidence 5: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Alison, for instance, found that her husband would go out with his friends at the weekend while she stayed at home, preparing lessons and doing the housework. Then there are factors that have the capacity to bring everything to a head. Money is one. “He’d say, ‘Well, you chose to have a low-paid job,’” Alison says. By then they’d had a (planned and wanted) baby, and children are another acknowledged marriage stressor. They bring high strain (in terms of finances, fatigue and housework) and often highlight different standards of care. “It wasn’t an easy time,” Alison says. “It reinforced just how different we were. Before, when we argued, I just thought, ‘Well, we’ll make up a few hours later.’ But when you’ve got a child, you don’t want to be falling out all the time..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 3: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
    - Evidence 4: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..

    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 3: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
    - Evidence 4: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 5: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","The proponents of abandoning marriage argue that it preserves harmful norms for women, ties people up with unfair obligations, and marriages are generally unstable. They claim that women are expected to be submissive to male family members and obey their husbands, which can result in violence or even death for not meeting these expectations. They also argue that marriages are unstable due to financial strain, having children, and changing societal expectations. Moreover, they believe that laws governing marital relations and wedding vows perpetuate women's subservience. Finally, they assert that monogamous relationships achieve most of the advantages of marriage, such as fostering emotional intimacy and reducing the risk of contracting STDs. Overall, they argue that abandoning marriage is necessary for creating more equitable and fulfilling relationships."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
    - Evidence 3: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..

- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to the long study and governments statistics gathered children are at higher risk if they “are perceived as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, wearing glasses or different clothing, being new to a school, or being unable to afford what kids consider 'cool.'.
    - Evidence 2: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 3: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
    - Evidence 4: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: B.R. international Public School shows that alongside featuring unity, uniforms likewise promote equality. Envision the circumstance without school uniforms. Students would show up in garments of their decision. Regardless of the amount we attempt, this will ingrain inequality- kids from rich foundations would wear their marked garments and adornments, while other students would build up a feeling of inadequacy..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 3: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
    - Evidence 4: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
    - Evidence 2: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
    - Evidence 3: In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result..
    - Evidence 4: One study showed that 70% of principals believed that mandated school uniforms reduced disciplinary problems at their schools..
    - Evidence 5: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
    - Evidence 3: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The opponents of the proposition argue that school uniforms should not be abandoned. They support their argument with five claims. First, they claim that children can still express themselves using other means, such as buttons or jewelry, as uniforms do not silence voices. Second, they argue that school uniforms reduce bullying, as uniforms make it harder for bullies to identify their targets. Third, they believe that school uniforms create a sense of equality and unity, as they promote unity and equality and boost school pride and spirit. Fourth, school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning, as students in uniforms are more focused in their academics, which also helps to minimize disciplinary problems. Finally, they argue that school uniforms save costs, as the cost of a year's worth of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is less than the cost of non-school outfits. The opponents provide evidence to support their claims, such as research findings, surveys, and statistics."

- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The people who make up the rules for uniform requirement have false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same. That sounds more like a post-apocalyptic society in which we are all forced to think the same and have no choices in our lives from the day we are born, similar to novels such as Anthem and Fahrenheit 451..
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..

So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
    - Evidence 2: In a study of consumer costs of uniforms and whether money is actually saved, researchers found that uniforms do not replace kid's clothing, and parents actually ended up spending more money on clothes when uniforms are required..
    - Evidence 3: 95 percent of parents think school uniforms cost too much. About 16 percent said they’ve had to cut back on food and other essentials to pay for uniforms, and 13 percent said its pushed them into debt..
    - Evidence 4: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, many types of clothes popular among female students (especially during hot weather) are considered to be “sexually suggestive” (“School dress codes,” 2017, para. 7). According to the proponents of such rules for teenage girls, short skirts and similar clothes contribute to sexual crime in schools (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 2: Dr Johanna Reidy from Otago’s Department of Public Health says girls are forced to wear uniforms that stop them from being active during breaks or cycling to school..
    - Evidence 3: A researcher from the University of Otago says a radical redesign of uniforms is needed.  Students are often made to wear school uniforms that leave them too hot in summer, too cold in winter and are physically restrictive for girls..
    - Evidence 4: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
    - Evidence 5: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: This idea is supported by testimony from a 17-year-old student forced to wear uniforms. Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
    - Evidence 2: According to Grace Chen of the Public School Review, forced conformity may leave students ill prepared to enter the adult world where appearance matters even if uniforms are not required..
    - Evidence 3: 'School uniforms only reinforce the notion that authority and obedience matter most, which does not factor into dressing appropriately for a job in an adult career field' contends Scott Key of Fresno State University..
    - Evidence 4: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
    - Evidence 5: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","The debate topic is on whether schools should abandon the use of school uniforms. Supporters of the stance that school uniforms should be abandoned put forward several arguments to support their position. Firstly, they argue that school uniforms harm learning and creativity. They argue that uniforms send the message that conformity is more important than creativity, and students are not allowed to express themselves. Secondly, they argue that school uniforms harm students' self-expression, which goes against the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Studies have also shown that students from schools without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools that forced students to wear uniforms. Thirdly, supporters of this stance argue that school uniforms are expensive, with the average cost of a school uniform being £340, and 95 percent of parents thinking that school uniforms cost too much. Fourthly, school uniforms are often uncomfortable and sexist, especially for female students, and they contribute to building a culture that is hostile to girls. Lastly, supporters argue that school uniforms increase conformity and harm individuality, which does not prepare students for adulthood. Overall, supporters of the stance that school uniforms should be abandoned believe that uniforms are detrimental to students' development and freedom of expression."

    - Evidence 1: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
    - Evidence 2: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..

    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
    - Evidence 3: Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals..
    - Evidence 4: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 5: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","The opponents of abolishing capital punishment argue that it helps the victims and their families find closure and justice, as well as serving as a deterrent for potential murderers. They believe that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes. The evidence presented includes statements from Henry McMaster, the Governor of South Carolina, and Leslie Rutledge, the Attorney General of Arkansas, emphasizing the importance of the death penalty in providing closure and deterring crime. Additionally, Charles Stimson, the Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, argues that the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. Furthermore, studies from researchers such as Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd demonstrate that capital punishment deters murder rates and provides a significant benefit to society."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Amnesty International, the death penalty is the ultimate, irreversible denial of human rights..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
    - Evidence 3: In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of people with mental retardation in Atkins v. Virginia, ruling that the practice constitutes cruel and unusual punishment..
    - Evidence 4: Execution is the ultimate, irrevocable punishment: the risk of executing an innocent person can never be eliminated. And such mistakes cannot be unmade. Since 1976, 143 US death row prisoners have been exonerated completely for their crimes..
    - Evidence 5: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In one occasion, Persian daily Neshat published an article which called for abolishing the death penalty, claiming that the capital punishment is no cure for maladies afflicting modern society..
    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
    - Evidence 3: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime..
    - Evidence 2: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 3: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
    - Evidence 4: Nick Petersen, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Miami, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: Social science research does not support the contention that the death penalty deters crime. In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that “available studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.” A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion. Citing a number of problems with deterrence research, the council reported that “claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgments about capital punishment..
    - Evidence 5: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
","The proponents of abolishing capital punishment make several arguments. First, they argue that state-sanctioned killing is fundamentally wrong, as it violates human rights and can never be undone. This is supported by evidence that the death penalty is often applied unfairly and arbitrarily, with people of color and those with lower incomes more likely to be sentenced to death. Additionally, mistakes can be made, with innocent people being sentenced to death. Second, they argue that the death penalty harms the disenfranchised, as it diverts resources away from other programs that could better increase public safety, health, and welfare. Moreover, it has no public safety benefit and is not a deterrent to crime, as evidenced by the fact that murder rates are often higher in states that have the death penalty. Finally, they argue that the death penalty is irreversible, as there is no way to undo the harm it causes. Overall, the proponents of abolishing capital punishment believe that it is a cruel, ineffective, and ultimately unjust practice that should be abolished."

Firstly, they claim that intellectual property rights incentivize creativity and innovation, citing evidence such as the WIPO treaty, which emphasizes the protection of intellectual property rights as crucial for economic growth. Secondly, they claim that intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products, with economists arguing that without such protections, there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organizations to produce intangible assets. Thirdly, they argue that intellectual property rights protect against stealing, with IPR treating intellectual property as a real property subject to analogous protections. Lastly, they claim that people or businesses own their innovations and should be compensated for their endeavors, with intellectual property rights providing a financial incentive for the creation and investment in intellectual property.

A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, a study was released that examined the effect of comprehensive background checks on the state. The study examined nearly two decades (1981-2000) of data and found that background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California..
    - Evidence 3: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
    - Evidence 4: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, 'The right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life'..
    - Evidence 2: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court struck down a New York law requiring parties interested in purchasing a handgun for the use of self-defense outside of the home to obtain a license because the law issued licenses on a “may-issue” rather than a “shall issue” basis. This “may issue” licensing method allowed state authorities to deny interested parties public use licenses for firearms if the interested party was unable to show “proper cause” as to why they have a heightened need for self-protection over the general population..
    - Evidence 4: In a 5-4 vote Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of individual Americans to keep and bear arms. The court said gun ownership is an individual right, not connected with military service, and that it can be regulated in some ways..
    - Evidence 5: The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. John McCain, released a statement applauding the decision. 'Today's ruling makes clear that other municipalities like Chicago that have banned handguns have infringed on the constitutional rights of Americans,' he said..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report, 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7% owned guns for target or sport shooting..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment..
    - Evidence 3: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Journalist John Stossel explained, “Criminals don’t obey the law… Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job… As the saying goes, ‘If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'”.
    - Evidence 2: Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, “the Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that ‘well-regulated’ militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to ‘insure domestic Tranquility’ and ‘provide for the common defence.'.
    - Evidence 3: Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama’s: 'every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.'.
    - Evidence 4: A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun..
    - Evidence 5: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
","The opponents of abolishing the right to keep and bear arms make the following arguments: 
Firstly, gun control is ineffective as criminals tend to obtain their firearms through illegal channels, and state and federal laws do not deter them. Additionally, studies have shown that most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates. 
Secondly, gun ownership is a right that stems from the natural right to self-defense and the Second Amendment of the US Constitution. The Supreme Court has also repeatedly affirmed the individual's right to possess firearms for self-defense. 
Thirdly, gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports shooting, as millions of Americans engage in these activities and spend billions on hunting and shooting equipment. 
Lastly, gun ownership promotes self-protection as it deters criminals from committing crimes and helps to insure domestic tranquility and provide for common defense. These arguments are backed by studies, surveys, and legal precedents."

- claim_1: Banning guns would save lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide (67.7% of all homicides) and by suicide (51.8% of all suicides)..
    - Evidence 2: A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that firearms were the second leading cause of deaths for children, responsible for 15% of child deaths compared to 20% in motor vehicle crashes..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death”.
    - Evidence 4: Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote 'We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.'.
    - Evidence 5: When US gun ownership goes down, overall suicide rates drop; meanwhile, each 10 percentage-point increase in gun ownership is linked to a 26.9% increase in the youth suicide rate..
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, 'The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation.'.
    - Evidence 2: A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand.”.
    - Evidence 3: An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, “gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns.”.
    - Evidence 4: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
    - Evidence 5: 'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add..
- claim_3: Guns can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that 'Almost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction.'.
    - Evidence 2: Between 2005 and 2010, 1.4 million guns were stolen from US homes during property crimes (including burglary and car theft), a yearly average of 232,400..
    - Evidence 3: Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, “with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft..
    - Evidence 4: According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who “used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence” obtained the gun from a family member or friend..
    - Evidence 5: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and “89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence.”.
    - Evidence 2: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2021, unintentional shooting deaths accounted for over 4% (2,007) of total gun related deaths (44,912) in the United States..
    - Evidence 4: A study from 2014 showed that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm..
    - Evidence 5: A 2001 study found that regardless of age, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns..
","The debate topic is 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', and the supporters of this stance have put forward four claims. Firstly, they argue that banning guns would save lives, citing several pieces of evidence to support this claim. For example, guns are the leading cause of death by homicide and suicide, and a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that firearms were the second leading cause of deaths for children. Additionally, legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death, and where guns are more available, there are more homicides. 

Secondly, the supporters argue that gun ownership allows for mass shootings and general gun violence. They present evidence such as the fact that the average gun owner is not trained in law enforcement or handling life-threatening situations, and increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation. Additionally, gun-inflicted deaths often ensue from impromptu arguments and fights, and guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance. 

Thirdly, the supporters argue that guns can fall into the wrong hands, and present evidence such as almost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction, and that 37.4% of state prison inmates who “used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence” obtained the gun from a family member or friend. They also cite the example of the Sutherland Springs church massacre where the perpetrator's domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns. 

Finally, the supporters argue that guns lead to accidental deaths, citing evidence such as states with the highest concentration of guns having nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths, and that most unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence.

We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Years of brutal cuts to public health services, following NHS reform legislation passed in 2012 which moved public health from the NHS to local authorities whose budgets were hit the hardest, had taken their toll..
    - Evidence 2: Nationally, local authority budgets were cut by nearly a third from 2010 to 2018, according to the UK National Audit Office and the public health grant fell by £700m in real terms between 2014/15 and 2019/20, as revealed by a Health Foundation report. Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed..
    - Evidence 3: As Sir Michael’s landmark report in February, 10 years on from the Marmot review of 2010, said: ‘From rising child poverty and the closure of children’s centres, to declines in education funding, an increase in precarious work and zero hours contracts, to a housing affordability crisis and a rise in homelessness, to people with insufficient money to lead a healthy life and resorting to food banks in large numbers, to ignored communities with poor conditions and little reason for hope… Austerity will cast a long shadow over the lives of the children born and growing up under its effects.’.
    - Evidence 4: The UK’s largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has documented a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. In that decade this food bank network went from distributing just under 26,000 parcels a year to handing out more than 1.33 million of them..
    - Evidence 5: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
    - Evidence 3: For instance, interest rates on Greek debt fell following its first bailout. However, the gains were limited to the government having decreased interest rate expenses. Although the private sector was unable to benefit, the major beneficiaries of lower rates are large corporations. Consumers benefited only marginally from lower rates, but the lack of sustainable economic growth kept borrowing at depressed levels despite the lower rates..
    - Evidence 4: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
    - Evidence 5: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In an excoriating 24-page report, which will be presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva next year, the eminent human rights lawyer Philip Alston said that in the UK 'poverty is a political choice'..
    - Evidence 2: Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,.
    - Evidence 3: Austerity Britain was in breach of four UN human rights agreements relating to women, children, disabled people and economic and social rights. “If you got a group of misogynists in a room and said how can we make this system work for men and not for women they would not have come up with too many ideas that are not already in place,” Philip Alston said..
    - Evidence 4: Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government should listen to the people being pushed into poverty by its policies. Universal credit is failing miserably, leaving families in debt, [in] rent arrears and at risk of becoming homeless. Three million children are growing up in poverty despite living in a working household..
    - Evidence 5: Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots – Denise Hunter, 57, at the West End food bank in Newcastle-on-Tyne.
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
    - Evidence 3: Because the evidence shows that austerity strangled the green shoots of economic recovery that were sprouting when the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition took office..
    - Evidence 4: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
    - Evidence 5: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers..
    - Evidence 2: Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%..
    - Evidence 3: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
    - Evidence 4: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
    - Evidence 5: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","The opponents of adopting an austerity regime argue that it would be detrimental for society. The first claim is that austerity cuts access to essential services, with evidence showing that local authority budgets were cut by almost a third from 2010 to 2018, resulting in closures of public services like Sure Start centers and libraries. Austerity has also led to rising child poverty and an increase in food bank usage. The second claim is that austerity extends recessions, with evidence showing that it has contractionary effects and exacerbates economic recessions, leading to high-level government officials resigning in countries like Argentina, Russia, and Turkey. The third claim is that austerity is unfair to citizens, with evidence showing that it breaches four UN human rights agreements relating to women, children, disabled people, and economic and social rights, leading to high levels of child poverty, despite the UK being the world's fifth-largest economy. The fourth claim is that austerity results in lower growth, with evidence showing that it strangles economic recovery and undermines improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, resulting in lower pay growth and living standards. The fifth and final claim is that austerity results in lower job creation, with evidence showing that cutting government spending leads to large-scale unemployment, particularly affecting vulnerable groups like women and those living in countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, Canada in 1993-96, cut their fiscal deficit but maintained strong economic growth..
    - Evidence 2: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 3: If budget deficits are not cut, it can lead to higher bond yields (e.g. in case of Greece, Spain and Ireland)..
    - Evidence 4: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
    - Evidence 5: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: If policymakers and the electorate show sufficient resolve, carrying through with austerity will eventually be rewarded by better financing conditions. Austerity pays off in the long run..
    - Evidence 4: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Astute monetary policy and falls in international commodity prices are given by a recent World Bank overview, as reasons for this relatively steady growth in the services and industrial sectors, enjoyed by Morocco and reflected in the country’s GDP..
    - Evidence 2: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 3: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
    - Evidence 4: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Countries use austerity measures to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. That's when creditors become concerned that the country will default on its debt. It occurs when the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is greater than 77%..
    - Evidence 2: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
    - Evidence 3: The Greek debt crisis led to a crisis in the eurozone. Many European banks had invested in Greek businesses and sovereign debt. Other countries, like Ireland, Portugal, and Italy, had also overspent. They took advantage of low-interest rates as eurozone members. The 2008 financial crisis hit these countries hard. As a result, they needed bailouts to keep from defaulting on their sovereign debt..
    - Evidence 4: Almost a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis, national debt in advanced economies remains near its highest level since World War II, averaging 104 percent of GDP. In Japan, the ratio is 240 percent and in Greece almost 185 percent. In Italy and Portugal, debt exceeds 120 percent of GDP. Without measures either to cut spending or increase revenue, the situation will only get worse..
    - Evidence 5: The most commonly proposed austerity measures in the IMF loans include wage bill cuts and freezes (31 countries), increases to or the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) (14 countries), and general public expenditure cuts (55 countries)..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Despite its negative reputation concerning its commitment to reforms and its implementation record, Greece has put forth an immense effort over the last three years and indeed has taken impressive steps toward achieving fiscal sustainability, with occasionally remarkable results. In the three years since the beginning of the crisis, it implemented a fiscal tightening of some 20% of GDP (around €50bn, while it has committed to measures cumulatively totalling €65bn by 2015) and reduced its budget deficit by an impressive nine percentage points, despite having lost a fifth of its GDP since 2009..
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.

    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The supporters of adopting an austerity regime argue that it has several benefits. Firstly, austerity can lead to improvements in economic measures as shown by Canada's fiscal deficit reduction while maintaining strong economic growth and Latvia's rebound in economic growth. Secondly, austerity is important in the long term as it gives investors greater confidence about the economy's long-term performance, reduces budget deficits, and encourages the private sector to invest. Thirdly, austerity is important to increase stability as seen in Morocco's steady growth, low inflation rates, and fall in unemployment due to austerity measures and pro-market reforms. Fourthly, austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts, as exceeding a debt-to-GDP ratio of 77% slows economic growth. Finally, austerity regimes are essential in economically troubled times as seen in the US between 1920 and 1921, the UK, Greece, and Spain during the global economic downturn of 2008. Overall, the benefits of austerity outweigh the negative consequences in the long term."

    - Evidence 2: As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film The Golden Compass, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be watered down from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says denigrates Christianity and promotes atheism for kids, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief..
    - Evidence 3: The report also criticized the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship; they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'..
    - Evidence 4: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..

    - Evidence 1: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..
    - Evidence 3: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..

","The opponents of adopting atheism argue that it violates freedom of religion and discriminates against religious people. They cite examples such as John Locke, who believed that denying God's existence would lead to social chaos, and the Albanian Constitution, which supported atheistic propaganda and imposed prison sentences for religious propaganda. They also argue that atheism lacks morality, as belief is necessary for individuals to give a coherent account of why they are obligated to lead a morally responsible life. However, they acknowledge that people should have the freedom to choose their beliefs, as demonstrated by the European Court of Human Rights' ruling that individuals cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behavior associated with a particular religion. Ultimately, the decision to adopt atheism or not is a matter of personal choice."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: La Mettrie defended a purely pleasure-based view of the proper end of human life, and advocated atheism as the only means of liberating human beings from the various forms of oppression which stand in the way of human progress..
    - Evidence 3: Being an atheists often comes with contradictory ideologies that the society thrusts upon people but on the inside, atheists are free of conflicting ideas. They do not need to debate almost every time some stranger comments or offends any religion for they not believe in religion. They do not ever get into heated debates about which religion is better than the other..
    - Evidence 4: They believe in scientific explanations and do not dwell on mythologies that are most of the time impossible to believe in unless you are a blind follower. Their reasons and concepts are clear and they are happy about whatever they believe to be true. Satisfaction at heart is the most important thing people seek and atheism brings it in the most literary and non-mythical way..
    - Evidence 5: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A few years ago, in a conversation with fellow atheist Peter Boghossian, Richard Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
    - Evidence 3: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 4: Theodore Drange (2006)  has developed an argument that if God were the sort of being that wanted humans to come to believe that he exists, then he could bring it about that far more of them would believe than currently do.  God would be able, he would want humans to believe, there is nothing that he would want more, and God would not be irrational.  So God would bring it about that people would believe.  In general, he could have brought it about that the evidence that people have is far more convincing than what they have.  He could have miraculously appeared to everyone in a fashion that was far more compelling than the miracles stories that we have.  It is not the case that all, nearly all, or even a majority of people believe, so there must not be a God of that sort..
    - Evidence 5: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
    - Evidence 3: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
    - Evidence 4: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
    - Evidence 3: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
    - Evidence 4: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The supporters of atheism argue that we should adopt atheism because it is beneficial to the person that adopts it. They claim that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, allowing for the evaluation of morality without being constrained by religious imperatives. They also argue that being an atheist leads to fewer conflicting ideas and more satisfaction at heart. Additionally, they argue that atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists. They provide several pieces of evidence, including the argument that belief in God is inherently irrational because it is not observable and that there is no evidence for God's existence. Furthermore, they argue that religions are immoral, with some religions teaching people to do horrible things. Finally, they claim that science can adequately explain the Universe, which can lead to intellectual fulfillment for atheists."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Carson coined the pejorative term vulgar libertarianism, a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality..
    - Evidence 2: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 3: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
    - Evidence 4: The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others..
    - Evidence 5: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
    - Evidence 3: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good..
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
    - Evidence 3: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For Gustav Landauer, propaganda of the deed meant the creation of libertarian social forms and communities that would inspire others to transform society..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.

    - Evidence 2: So why not prohibit alcohol .. I submit that there is only one why not, and this should be no news to libertarians who presumably believe in inalienable individual rights: namely, that no one has the right to coerce anyone not himself directly engaged in an overt act of aggression against rights..
    - Evidence 3: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
    - Evidence 4: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters..
","The debate topic is whether we should adopt libertarianism or not. Supporters of the adoption of libertarianism argue that it has several benefits.

We should ban human cloning,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
    - Evidence 3: Cloning can also be used to improve the quality of life for people with certain medical conditions. For example, cloning can be used to create replacement tissues for people with conditions like Parkinson's disease, which can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. A study by the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that transplantation of human stem cells can help to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease..
    - Evidence 4: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. By creating human cells and tissues that are specific to an individual, researchers can better understand the effects of new treatments and drugs on human health. For example, a study by the National Institutes of Health found that human tissue cloning can help to reduce the need for animal testing..
    - Evidence 5: Cloning can also be used to advance medical research in a number of different areas.

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at Oregon State University, says, Some traditions and leading figures in conservative Protestantism who were opposed to human cloning for reproductive reasons have come to see that given the ambiguity about their own views about the status of embryonic life, and given the potential for health benefits, they could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning..
    - Evidence 2: For example, scientists could clone specific organs and use them to replace damaged or diseased organs in individuals. A study by the Lancet medical journal found that cloning could provide a source of organs for those in need of transplants..
    - Evidence 3: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic makeup of individuals with a particular disease and to develop therapies that target the underlying cause of the disease. A study by the Nature Genetics journal found that cloning could be used to develop gene therapies for a range of diseases..
    - Evidence 4: For example, scientists could use cloning to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases. A study by the Nature journal found that cloning could greatly advance stem cell research..

We should ban human cloning,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
    - Evidence 3: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning in 1997. The opinion states, the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited..
    - Evidence 2: The basis for this justification is that reproductive human cloning necessarily infringes notions of human dignity..
    - Evidence 3: Through the act of creating another human being, Christians have also posed the question as to whether this would be too much like playing God. Not only this, but some Christian ethicists argue that human cloning would create substantial issues of identity and individuality.This could be seen through the confusion of the child resulting from cloning as to who his parents are, what connection he has to his genetic duplicate, etc..
    - Evidence 4: The Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and its Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Being appear to ban SCNT of human beings. Of the Council's 45 member states, the Convention has been signed by 31 and ratified by 18. The Additional Protocol has been signed by 29 member nations and ratified by 14..
    - Evidence 5: Pope John Paul II: These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself.
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Much of the concern related to human cloning stems from a fear of overstepping the bounds of the natural order..
    - Evidence 2: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
    - Evidence 3: The Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and saw the alleged clone baby as an aberration..
    - Evidence 4: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child..
    - Evidence 2: Scientists with experience in animal cloning have encountered low rates of success per implantation, where cloned fetuses are often malformed and dead before birth..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
    - Evidence 4: A study published in the journal Nature Biotechnology in 2005 found that cloning can result in genetic mutations that may cause long-term health problems and reduced lifespan..
    - Evidence 5: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2008 reported that cloning may result in unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences for the health of the cloned organism..
","The debate topic is whether human cloning should be banned. The positive supporters of this stance present four claims as follows: 

First, cloning is not understood enough yet, and its potential for creating ethical and societal problems is a concern. This is supported by evidence 1, which argues that repugnance towards cloning is a form of deep wisdom that modern ethical discourse fails to provide, and evidence 2, which suggests that cloning could lead to the creation of monsters and other dislocations. 

Second, cloning is unethical and anti-religious, and goes against notions of human dignity. Evidence 1 states that cloning is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited, while evidence 2 argues that reproductive human cloning infringes on human dignity. Evidence 3 also presents the concerns of Christian ethicists who argue that cloning creates issues of identity and individuality, and the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and its Additional Protocol to the Convention appear to ban cloning human beings. 

Third, cloning is unnatural and goes against the natural order. This is supported by evidence 1, which states that much of the concern stems from a fear of overstepping natural bounds, and evidence 2, which presents the perspective of a Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist who believes that humans should only be created by acts of love between two people. 

Fourth, cloning is unsafe and can result in health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death. Evidence 2, 3, 4, and 5 all present studies that report low success rates for cloning animals, health problems for cloned organisms, and unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences. 

Overall, the supporters of banning human cloning present a range of ethical, societal, religious, and safety concerns that suggest that cloning should be prohibited until further research and understanding can mitigate these concerns."

","Private military companies (PMCs) have been under scrutiny for their operations and practices, leading to a growing belief that they should be banned. Supporters of this stance have put forth several arguments to support their claims. Firstly, PMCs are less ethical and more likely to commit crimes, as evidenced by several reports from Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the United Nations. Additionally, PMCs are not considered professional due to their lack of accountability and transparency, poor training of personnel, and unclear chain of command. Furthermore, there is a lack of trust in the loyalty of PMCs to the hiring country due to a conflict of interest between the interests of the client and the country. The main interest of PMCs is profit, as seen in their prioritization of profit over ethical and legal considerations and the unregulated nature of the industry. Finally, PMCs can solicit, engage, or prolong conflicts due to their financial incentive to do so and encourage militarization of conflicts. In conclusion, supporters argue that PMCs should be banned to prevent unethical practices, lack of accountability, and financial motivations for conflict."

That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..

- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..

- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
    - Evidence 3: “The president has been really explicit ... that Gitmo is a very, very important tool,” Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said on Fox News this morning. It's also important to understand that Guantanamo Bay is an incredibly important intelligence asset..
    - Evidence 4: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..
    - Evidence 5: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..
","The opponents of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp argue that it would harm national security. They present evidence that the remaining detainees are hardened terrorists, and transferring them to another country could risk national security. Furthermore, approximately 17.5 percent of former detainees transferred to other countries have reengaged in terrorist activities. The camp is also necessary for detaining high-value enemy combatants who pose a continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the United States. 

They also argue that the camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives. The facility provides humane treatment, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world. It is also a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security, and medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world.

Lastly, the opponents argue that the camp is essential to gain intelligence. The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. Transferring terrorists from the camp would hinder the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts operations. It is also the single greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror. Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility. Therefore, the opponents of closing the camp argue that it is crucial to national security, humane treatment, and intelligence gathering."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241..
    - Evidence 3: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
    - Evidence 4: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
    - Evidence 2: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 3: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
    - Evidence 4: Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad..
    - Evidence 5: The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
    - Evidence 3: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
    - Evidence 2: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
    - Evidence 3: The cost of running Guantanamo Bay's prison and court system jumped by nearly $90 million from 2013 to 2018, even as the number of prisoners there has decreased. That is according to a new analysis from Carol Rosenberg at The New York Times..
    - Evidence 4: Simply by transferring the 84 detainees already cleared to leave Guantanamo, the United States could save nearly $2 billion over the next 10 years..
    - Evidence 5: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
    - Evidence 2: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
    - Evidence 3: The CSRT applies a broad definition of enemy combatant that inevitably ensnares innocent people;  applies a presumption of guilt;  has no juries; disables prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence;  prohibits prisoners from having lawyers;   and relies on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely..
    - Evidence 4: A government report describes the facility as having been “modified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,” with doors that had been “sealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.” Inside, the walls were “covered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.” There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound..
    - Evidence 5: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
","The debate topic is whether or not Guantanamo Bay detention camp should be closed. The positive supporters have presented six claims as their arguments. Firstly, they argue that detainees have the right to trial in US courts, as evidenced by the Supreme Court ruling in Boumediene v. Bush. Secondly, they contend that Guantanamo Bay harms the US image, reputation, and institutions, and is a recruitment tool for terrorists. Thirdly, they argue that the detention camp is a symbol of discrimination and injustice, both domestically and internationally. Fourthly, they maintain that the detention camp is expensive, with a current cost of over $6 billion to operate. Fifthly, they claim that personnel at the detention camp commit crimes against the prisoners, including torture and arbitrary detention. Finally, they argue that the tactics used at Guantanamo Bay are unjust and include physical abuse, isolation, and deprivation of sensory stimuli, among others."
We should end affirmative action,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Scott Plous, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Wesleyan University, wrote in his article “Ten Myths About Affirmative Action,” posted on his website: 'Several studies have documented important gains in racial and gender equality as a direct result of affirmative action.'.
    - Evidence 2: Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, told CBS News, 'If we as a nation are serious about creating equity and justice, we have to institute programs that have been proven to create more equity in our schools, in our colleges, and our workplaces.' He added, 'Affirmative action programs in education have been demonstrated to increase diversity and increase access specifically for underrepresented groups.'.
    - Evidence 3: For example, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect..
    - Evidence 4: Nearly 70 major US companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, General Electric Co., and JetBlue Airways Corp. warned in a brief to the court that without affirmative action they’ll lose access to “a pipeline of highly qualified future workers and business leaders” — and will struggle to meet diversity hiring goals they’ve set..
    - Evidence 5: By the end of his tenure, UC was admitting more minority students than it was in 1997, the year before the ban on affirmative action took effect..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Barack Obama, JD, 44th President of the United States, provided the following statement on affirmative action to the NAACP “2008 Voter Action Center,”: 'I support affirmative action. When there is strong evidence of prolonged and systemic discrimination by organizations, affirmative action may be the only meaningful remedy available.'.
    - Evidence 2: Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
    - Evidence 3: These programs have brought or accompanied significant gains for women and minorities. In the past 25 years, black participation in the work force has increased 50 percent and the percentage of blacks holding managerial positions has jumped fivefold. In 1970, women comprised only 5 percent of lawyers compared to 20 percent today. Twenty-five years ago, the student population at University of California, Berkeley, was 80 percent white compared to 45 percent today..
    - Evidence 4: In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation's economic opportunities [REF]..
    - Evidence 5: The justification for affirmative action is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture,[REF] and to address existing discrimination [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Organization for Women (NOW) stated the following in its article 'Talking About Affirmative Action,':'Affirmative Action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95% to 97% of the high-level corporate jobs. And that’s with affirmative action programs in place. Imagine how low figures would be without affirmative action.'.
    - Evidence 2: Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve a range of goals: bridging inequalities in employment and pay; increasing access to education; enriching state, institutional, and professional leadership with the full spectrum of society; redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances, in particular addressing the apparent social imbalance left in the wake of slavery and slave laws..
    - Evidence 3: The government claimed that this was an affirmative action scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education..
    - Evidence 4: Affirmative action - provide positive preferential treatment in allotment of jobs and access to higher education, as a means to accelerate the integration of the SCs and STs with mainstream society..
    - Evidence 5: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
","The opponents of ending affirmative action argue that it should be continued due to the following reasons:
Firstly, affirmative action programs have been proven to increase diversity and improve access for underrepresented groups. Several studies have documented important gains in racial and gender equality as a direct result of affirmative action. For instance, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in the likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect. Furthermore, almost 70 major US companies warned that without affirmative action, they’ll lose access to “a pipeline of highly qualified future workers and business leaders” and will struggle to meet diversity hiring goals they’ve set. Therefore, ending affirmative action would hamper the progress made towards a more diverse and equal society.
Secondly, affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past. These programs have brought significant gains for women and minorities, with black participation in the workforce increasing by 50 percent in the past 25 years and the percentage of blacks holding managerial positions jumping fivefold. Affirmative action helps to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future. It is a meaningful remedy when there is strong evidence of prolonged and systemic discrimination by organizations. Therefore, ending affirmative action would be a step back in the progress made towards combating discrimination and promoting equal opportunities.
Lastly, affirmative action reduces discrimination. Affirmative action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95% to 97% of the high-level corporate jobs, and that’s with affirmative action programs in place. Therefore, without affirmative action, the figures would be even lower. Affirmative action provides positive preferential treatment in the allotment of jobs and access to higher education, as a means to accelerate the integration of the socially and economically disadvantaged groups with mainstream society. Hence, ending affirmative action would increase discrimination against already marginalized groups and hamper efforts to achieve a more diverse and equal society."

    - Evidence 2: Li came to the decision to file a civil rights complaint against Princeton after reading studies by Princeton researchers which claimed that ending affirmative action in university admissions would lead to 80% of placements currently offered to black and Latino students instead being given to Asian Americans [REF]..
    - Evidence 3: Some opponents believe, among other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive..
    - Evidence 4: Opponents also contend that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of all those who belong to groups it is intended to help, therefore making affirmative action counterproductive [REF]..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Affirmative action is not just.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Affirmative action is a shallow solution to a much deeper issue in the American education system. We are failing a larger demographic of students who deserve the same educational opportunities as everyone else..
    - Evidence 2: While this system may seem helpful at diversifying campuses on the surface, it is simply putting a Band-Aid on systematic issues..
    - Evidence 3: Affirmative action is peak performative activism, as it focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities..
    - Evidence 4: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..

    - Evidence 3: Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticised as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger..
    - Evidence 4: Hardin's last book The Ostrich Factor: Our Population Myopia (1999), a warning about the threat of overpopulation to the Earth's sustainable economic future, called for coercive constraints on 'unqualified reproductive rights' and argued that affirmative action is a form of racism..
    - Evidence 5: Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..
- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
    - Evidence 2: Williams believes programs such as affirmative action and minimum wage laws set up to aide minorities have, in fact, been harmful to them and stifled their ability to advance in society..
    - Evidence 3: Some opponents[REF] further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects and that it fails to achieve its goals..
    - Evidence 4: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university..
    - Evidence 5: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
","The supporters of ending affirmative action make several arguments. First, they argue that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities. Opponents believe that it devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it is supposed to help, and some argue that it is ineffective and not just. Affirmative action is also claimed to perpetuate prejudice and reduce quality, as race-based affirmative action programs sweep systemic problems under the carpet. For instance, Clint Bolick claims that it perpetuates fraud upon the very groups it is designed to help, while Williams argues that it is harmful to minorities and stifles their ability to advance in society. Therefore, the proponents of ending affirmative action believe that it is not a solution to a deeper issue in the American education system and that it should be eliminated."

    - Evidence 5: The Impact of Mandatory Retirement on Social Connections and Loneliness by Linda George, published in The Gerontologist, found that mandatory retirement can lead to decreased social connections and increased feelings of loneliness, both of which can negatively impact quality of life..
- claim_5: We should let everyone retire when they are ready.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A study by the World Health Organization in 2013 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready can promote well-being, as it gives individuals greater control over their lives and allows them to pursue activities that bring them happiness and fulfillment..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Harvard Business Review in 2017 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports individual choice, as it allows individuals to make decisions about their own lives, rather than having those decisions made for them by mandatory retirement ages..
    - Evidence 3: A study by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2012 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready can maintain older workers' skills and experience, promoting intergenerational collaboration and reducing the skills gap in the workplace..
    - Evidence 4: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging, as older workers can continue to contribute to the workforce, using their skills and experience to benefit society..
    - Evidence 5: A study by the World Economic Forum in 2016 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready can reduce the risk of poverty in old age, as older workers can continue to earn an income, reducing their dependence on social security and pension benefits..
","The supporters of ending mandatory retirement argue that it is beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, mandatory retirement decreases institutional knowledge. Secondly, mandatory retirement harms the economy as it reduces labor force participation, decreases productivity, and leads to an inefficient use of human capital. Thirdly, mandatory retirement is not fair and can result in age discrimination. Fourthly, mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, as it can lead to decreased physical and cognitive function, economic well-being, psychological well-being, social connections, and feelings of loneliness. Finally, the supporters argue that everyone should be allowed to retire when they are ready as it promotes well-being, individual choice, intergenerational collaboration, active aging, and reduces the risk of poverty in old age."

    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack.

- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, said Deepti Choubey, senior director of nuclear and bio-security at the Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington. These are the materials that a terrorist would use to make a kind of bomb that you would use for nuclear terrorism attacks and they are currently spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world..
    - Evidence 2: Bart Dal, adviser for nuclear security and safeguards at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said terrorism had increased since September 2011 – meaning the whole nuclear world has to improve security. “Imagine what the effect would be if they [terrorists] succeeded,” he said. “The consequences are so large that we have to take this into account. If you expose a nuclear weapon in one city or more, that would change our lives forever.”.
    - Evidence 3: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 4: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
    - Evidence 5: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On 21 September 2022, Mr Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” of Russian citizens to serve in the war in Ukraine. He also accused NATO members of making statements about “the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia”. He threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory: In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff..
    - Evidence 2: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 3: More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and other NATO countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a single nuclear warning shot, according to a terrifying simulation..
    - Evidence 4: Max Tegmark: Soviet Sub Captain Decides to Fire Nuclear Torpedo During Cuban Missile Crisis To me, this is both harrowing and educational: it shows how great risk can come from the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings that couldn’t start a nuclear war on their own, but can provide the perfect storm when combined. The fact that it remained secret for decades also suggests that there may be recent scary incidents that we haven’t yet heard of..
    - Evidence 5: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
","The proponents of the abolition of nuclear weapons have presented two main claims to support their stance. Firstly, nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands, as evidenced by the large amount of weapons-usable nuclear material that is spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries worldwide. This poses a significant risk of nuclear terrorism, which has increased since September 2011, and could result in catastrophic consequences that would change our lives forever. Additionally, there is a risk of accidents, errors, or the possibility of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the wrong hands to avoid such disastrous outcomes.

Secondly, the proponents argue that nuclear weapons provoke or escalate disastrous military action, as evidenced by past events. For example, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings almost led to a nuclear war. Similarly, recent events, such as the war in Ukraine, have seen the threat of the use of nuclear weapons being made. In such scenarios, even a single nuclear warning shot could result in more than 91 million people being killed or injured within three hours. Therefore, the use of nuclear weapons must be avoided, and their abolition should be pursued to prevent such catastrophic outcomes."

    - Evidence 4: For example, they argue that industrialization supports greater efficiency of agriculture through technology, an advantage for the productivity of rural farmers as well as urban consumers..
    - Evidence 5: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Biodiversity will play an increasingly important role within the urban landscape..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
    - Evidence 3: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..

    - Evidence 1: As internal migration by farmers looking for better-paying jobs in urban hubs causes a significant rural-urban inequality gap (the owners of firms would be profiting, while laborers from those industries would see their incomes rise at a much slower rate and agricultural workers would possibly see their incomes decrease), rural populations decrease as urban populations increase..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization are associated with a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (see also acid rain) and hydrogen sulfide, which may affect plant metabolism..
    - Evidence 3: Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural activities largely contribute sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers..
    - Evidence 4: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
    - Evidence 5: A specific concern is urbanization, which affects water quality by increasing its load of metals and organic contaminants..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The fast urbanization of Tagum from the late '80s to 1990 which was attributed to the mushrooming of business establishments and other commercial activities, increasing population and services and other factors, has caused various problems and needs, like roads, drainage, the increasing numbers of squatters, upscaling trend of traffic congestion in major streets, garbage and sanitation, land use and others..

    - Evidence 4: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 5: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..
","The debate topic is 'We should fight urbanization'. The positive supporters argue that urbanization has negative consequences, including economic decline, increased crime, harm to the environment, and resource strain. They present several claims and evidence to support their argument. Firstly, they claim that restrictions on migration would benefit people in rural areas economically and socially. They provide evidence that shows the decline of agrarian production and governmental neglect leading to economic disinvestment and depopulation in Venezuela, among other examples. Secondly, they argue that urbanization causes crime, and provide evidence that supports this claim, including rising crime rates during the period of industrialization and a rise in urban crime, poverty, and health problems in Māori communities. Thirdly, they assert that urbanization harms the environment, and cite evidence of increased energy demand and emissions of air pollutants, which may affect plant metabolism, and an increase in sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters, among other negative effects.

We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 3: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 3: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..

We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study finds that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement in several ways..
    - Evidence 2: A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda by up to 20 percentage points..
    - Evidence 3: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Since voting at referendums in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory has been allowed in 1977, compulsory voting has also applied there..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
    - Evidence 3: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 3: A counter argument to opponents of compulsory voting is that in these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot..
    - Evidence 4: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 5: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..
","The debate topic is 'We should introduce compulsory voting.' The positive supporters of this argument present three main claims. Firstly, compulsory voting increases representation. Studies have found that it reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement and increases support for leftist policy positions. It also ensures that candidates address the needs of all voters and prevents the political system from being skewed towards the well-off and well-educated. Secondly, compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. This is evident from the higher turnout in places like the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, where compulsory voting is enforced. It also increases the legitimacy of elected representatives and increases the political education of the people. Thirdly, people have an obligation to vote. Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, and mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms. Furthermore, voting is one of our most important rights, and those who don't vote are taking that right for granted. Overall, the positive supporters argue that introducing compulsory voting will increase representation, political engagement, and fulfill people's obligation to vote."
We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:

    - Evidence 2: A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash..
    - Evidence 3: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
    - Evidence 2: Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs..
    - Evidence 3: The Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse..
    - Evidence 4: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
    - Evidence 5: Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs..

That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys.
    - Evidence 2: Despite over $7 billion spent annually towards arresting[REF] and prosecuting nearly 800,000 people across the country for marijuana offenses in 2005 (FBI Uniform Crime Reports), the federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey reports about 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain. That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys..
    - Evidence 3: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 4: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..

- claim_5: Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Take California for example: first in the nation to legalize the medical use of the drug in 1996, the state would go on to legalize recreational use in 2016. But in just the past year, the state reported several massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza – just over the last three or four months..

","The opponents of legalizing cannabis put forward several arguments against it. Firstly, they argue that cannabis harms the body. Dutch research has shown that higher THC content increases the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, especially among younger or inexperienced smokers. Additionally, chronic smoking of marijuana can change blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Secondly, opponents argue that cannabis increases lack of judgement and accidents. Studies have found that acute cannabis use increases the risk of automobile crashes, and deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the US over the past two decades. Thirdly, opponents argue that cannabis is a gateway drug and addictive. Research has found that THC alters the opioid system associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates and can lead to abuse of other illicit drugs. Finally, opponents argue that legalizing cannabis can make it more accessible to underage teenagers and children, which has been proven in the case of Alaska. They also argue that legalizing cannabis will boost black-market and criminal activity, as seen in the recent illegal cannabis busts in California."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: In 2001, the New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group stated that decriminalizing cannabis will result in greater availability of resources to respond to more serious crimes without any increased risks to public safety..
    - Evidence 3: Psychopharmacologist David Nutt argues, though he is against full declassification, that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco, which, if they were invented today would be illegal..
    - Evidence 4: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
    - Evidence 5: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
    - Evidence 3: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..

- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 3: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
    - Evidence 2: Nicholas Green, chairman of the Bar Council, made comments in a report in the profession's magazine, in which he said that drug-related crime costs the UK economy about Â£13bn a year and that there was growing evidence that decriminalisation could free up police resources, reduce crime and recidivism and improve public health..
    - Evidence 3: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
    - Evidence 4: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
    - Evidence 5: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..

","The supporters of legalizing cannabis present several arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that alcohol and tobacco, which are more harmful drugs, remain legal. Evidence shows that these legal drugs have caused over half a million deaths annually, while cannabis has only been the cause of a few deaths. Additionally, legalizing cannabis would reduce crime and save billions of dollars that are currently spent on prohibition enforcement. 

Secondly, legalizing cannabis could benefit the economy by generating tax revenues and reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement. According to a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, a taxed and regulated cannabis market in the UK would save the exchequer £6.7 billion. 

Thirdly, cannabis is relatively safe and has been shown to have medical benefits. There are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans, and the Institute of Medicine has stated that cannabis does have medical benefits. 

Fourthly, if cannabis was legalized, it could be regulated, reducing black-market activity, and criminal behavior. Legalizing cannabis would decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking, which is a significant contributor to drug-related crime costs. 

Fifthly, legalizing cannabis could reduce drug-related violence and improve public health. The drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence, and alternative models for drug control may be necessary. Finally, supporters argue that people should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies, citing the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill."
We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
    - Evidence 2: One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana. The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia..
    - Evidence 3: Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes..
    - Evidence 4: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Additionally it is argued that the legalisation of prostitution would result in an increase in human trafficking and crime..
    - Evidence 2: Bob Herbert also stated that many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps: Despite the fiction that they are independent contractors,most so-called legal prostitutes have pimps - the state-sanctioned pimps who run the brothels and, in many cases, a second pimp who controls all other aspects of their lives (and takes the bulk of their legal earnings)..
    - Evidence 3: The United Nations stated in 2009 that sex trafficking is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking and estimates that about 79% of human trafficking reported is for prostitution.
    - Evidence 4: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
    - Evidence 5: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
    - Evidence 2: Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men..
    - Evidence 3: Columnist Bob Herbert wrote A grotesque exercise in the dehumanization of women is carried out routinely at Sheri's Ranch, a legal brothel about an hour's ride outside of Vegas. There the women have to respond like Pavlov's dog to an electronic bell that might ring at any hour of the day or night. At the sound of the bell, the prostitutes have five minutes to get to an assembly area where they line up, virtually naked, and submit to a humiliating inspection by any prospective customer who has happened to drop by.
    - Evidence 4: The Aboriginal Women's Action Network, an abolitionist organization in Canada, has specifically noted that because the prostitution of Aboriginal women results from and reinforces such extreme hatred of Aboriginal women, no regime of legalisation (which will expand the industry and entrap more women) can be safer for Aboriginal women. Prostitution can only further harm Aboriginal women..
    - Evidence 5: Melissa Farley argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes, saying, Nevada's rape rate is higher than the U.S. average and way higher than the rape rate in California, New York and New Jersey. Why is this? Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them, are disrespected by men, and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women..
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..

We should legalize prostitution,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
    - Evidence 2: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..

    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The report also addressed the suggestion of civil remedy, stating that the person exploited in prostitution may normally be considered the injured party, implying a civil right to damages under the law..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 3: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
    - Evidence 4: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
    - Evidence 5: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent..
    - Evidence 2: The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person. Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry..
    - Evidence 3: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
    - Evidence 4: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear..
    - Evidence 2: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 3: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 4: Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution in toto, there is some evidence that regulation of China's recreational venues has helped to create a legitimate female service worker with the right to refuse to engage in practices repugnant to the valid labour contract, as well as the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace..
    - Evidence 5: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Many people who support legal prostitution argue that prostitution is a consensual sex act between adults and a victimless crime, thus the government should not prohibit this practice..
    - Evidence 2: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
    - Evidence 3: For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word prostitution to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term criminal sexual acts..
    - Evidence 4: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 5: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..
","The debate topic is whether or not prostitution should be legalized. Supporters of legalizing prostitution have presented multiple arguments. First, legalizing prostitution boosts the economy as it is a necessary profession in big cities and can generate taxable income. Second, legalizing prostitution increases benefits for sex workers such as health care, safe sex, and unionization. Third, legalization allows for regulation of the profession and promotes consistent condom use to reduce sexually transmitted diseases. Fourth, legalizing prostitution makes the profession safer for women by reducing violence and promoting harm reduction policies. Lastly, supporters argue that sex work is a valid choice over one's body, which should not be prohibited by the government. Overall, supporters believe that decriminalizing and legalizing prostitution would provide benefits and improve the safety and well-being of sex workers."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Instead of policy expanding women's opportunities for gainful employment policy, from 1979 onward the one-child policy has added upon the son preference causing the largest number of missing women in any country..
    - Evidence 2: Some bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society . Charles Lockwood of Yale says, a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars..
    - Evidence 3: When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences..
    - Evidence 4: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
    - Evidence 5: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
    - Evidence 2: Gender-biased sex selection (GBSS) is a result and an expression of cultural preference for sons..
    - Evidence 3: Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son, while a deeply rooted son preference makes many families want a son..
    - Evidence 4: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
    - Evidence 5: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 3: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
    - Evidence 4: Under the tradition of son preference and the one-child policy, missing females in China are formed through sex-selective abortion, discrimination in care for females, and non-registration of girls at birth..
    - Evidence 5: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
","The opponents argue against legalizing sex selection. Firstly, they claim that sex selection can lead to gender imbalance, which is evident in countries like China and India where son preference has caused a significant decline in the number of girls born. This can lead to social unrest and wars. Secondly, sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases. It is a result of cultural preference for sons, which has persisted in traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy. Thirdly, sex selection will create abortions and infanticide. It allows parents to abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child and can result in neglect of girls and female infanticide, as seen in China under the one-child policy. Although sex-selective abortions were banned in China in 2006, repeat abortions are still common among women with no sons. Legalizing sex selection would perpetuate these issues and is therefore not advisable."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Most families opt for unisex stuffs for babies before they are born. From clothes to toys, the color of the crib to the various necessities and accessories, everything is gender neutral in most cases. With gender selection or knowing baby’s gender can help every family to buy gender specific items. This not only does away with the ambiguity but actually helps the baby to get the best stuff as well. There is also a financial aspect as after the birthing of a baby, the parents always spend money on items that are for a boy or girl respectively. Knowing the gender or choosing gender allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The economic advantage is not oft talked about but it is significant..
    - Evidence 3: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
    - Evidence 4: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 4: There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire..
    - Evidence 5: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 3: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The debate is on whether sex selection should be legalized or not. The positive supporters of the idea argue that legalizing sex selection will provide several benefits. Firstly, it will be within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child. The desire to have a daughter or son is prevalent in most people, and sex selection can fulfill this desire. Additionally, choosing baby's gender can help in instilling some gender balance in the family, allows for smart shopping during the trimesters, and can prevent gender-specific diseases from being passed onto a baby.

Secondly, sex selection allows for better family planning. Parents can choose the number of children they want and the gender of the baby, ensuring they raise just an adequate number of children and can provide them with good education and proper nutrition. Moreover, sex selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father's family name.

Thirdly, sex selection makes the family more happy/complete. Adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex. For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option. It is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire.

Fourthly, sex selection prevents diseases in the child. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases.

Finally, sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide. Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females. Legalizing sex selection will give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer, preventing the need for abortions or infanticide."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In common usage, the phrase 'flag burning' refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest..
    - Evidence 2: In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7-2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:  In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth..
    - Evidence 3: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 5: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Judge White did not go so far as to say that flag-burning is not constitutionally protected; rather, he wrote that without the benefit of the majority's thinking if it were to find flag burning protected by the First Amendment, I would sustain such a conviction..
    - Evidence 2: In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 3: the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
    - Evidence 4: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
","Opponents of prohibiting flag burning argue that it is a form of expression, protest, and critique that is protected under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. They cite several cases, including Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District and Texas v. Johnson, where courts have ruled that symbolic speech, including burning the flag, is a protected form of expression. They argue that the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution means that there is no separate juridical category for the American flag alone. They also contend that freedom of expression justifies flag burning, as the government cannot prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive or disagreeable."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Warren was of the opinion that laws against flag-burning are constitutional.
    - Evidence 2: Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country's own national flag and flags of other countries..
    - Evidence 3: By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag..
    - Evidence 4: For example, Hugo Black did not believe that flag burning was speech; in Street v. New York (1969), he wrote: It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Rehnquist argued that flag burning is no essential part of any exposition of ideas but rather the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 4: According to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The debate topic is whether or not flag burning should be prohibited. The positive supporters argue that flags are important symbols that should be respected, and that flag burning is an inflammatory act. In support of the first claim, they provide evidence such as the fact that some countries have laws against flag burning, and that the United States had state laws against flag desecration by 1932. They also argue that prohibiting flag burning would be consistent with the views of legal scholars such as Warren and Black. In support of the second claim, they argue that flag burning is often done to provoke a reaction rather than to express a particular idea, and that it is therefore an act of aggression rather than free speech. They also point to examples of flag burning being used as a form of anti-American protest. Overall, the supporters of the prohibition of flag burning believe that it is an act that is disrespectful to the flag and to the nation it represents."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls and makes our communities safer and healthier. It is a human right and it is good for the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations. Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy. In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy..
    - Evidence 3: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
    - Evidence 4: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
    - Evidence 5: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: As a health professional and a researcher, Mar Nagel found that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions. They have better social and communication skills than men, possess strong memory, are sophisticated and show precision and fast reaction and response time..
    - Evidence 3: Equal or Better Performance at Military Service Academies: Women have been admitted to the Army, Navy and Air Force Academies since 1978. In this year’s first graduating classes with women, the women’s performance has equaled and often surpassed that of their male counterparts..
    - Evidence 4: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
    - Evidence 5: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address..
    - Evidence 2: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 4: The more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed..
    - Evidence 5: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Nindl, et al. (p. 51, 2016), training programs increased the number of pull-ups that women were capable of, demonstrating that they could overcome their naturally smaller muscle mass. Additionally, their research found that women performed better than men in ultra-endurance, or the ability to physical endure for a given extended period of time. These studies suggest that women excel in some abilities, and that while men are indeed stronger as a physical typicality, there are exceptions and other ways that women can compete..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
    - Evidence 3: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 4: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
    - Evidence 2: In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty..
    - Evidence 3: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 4: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
    - Evidence 5: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: As long as they qualify and meet the standards, women will now be able to contribute to our mission in ways they could not before. They'll be able to drive tanks, give orders, lead infantry soldiers into combat, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said at a news conference Thursday (Dec. 3)..
    - Evidence 2: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
    - Evidence 3: Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
","The opponents of the proposition argue that women should not be prohibited from combat for the following reasons:

Firstly, gender equality is a human right and is good for the economy. Increasing women's participation in the economy is good for the economy, and everyone benefits from gender equality. Secondly, women are an asset in combat. They have unique skills and strategies, and their performance has equaled and often surpassed that of their male counterparts. Thirdly, women can create unique skills/strategies. In some combat positions, only female service members are equipped to address security risks posed by Afghan women on patrols. Fourthly, women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat. Women have always proudly served in the military in different capacities and performed critical jobs. Lastly, women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to, and they should be accepted as long as they pass the tests. Women have already been unofficially serving in the battlefield, excelling, and providing invaluable insight to their command teams. As long as women qualify and meet the standards, they should be allowed to contribute to the mission in ways they could not before."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
    - Evidence 3: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
    - Evidence 4: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
    - Evidence 2: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
    - Evidence 3: While the majority of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves.  In addition, combat units engage in activities designed to suit men’s capabilities. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this..
    - Evidence 4: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
    - Evidence 5: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Having women serving in direct combat will hamper mission effectiveness by hurting unit morale and cohesion..
    - Evidence 2: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
    - Evidence 3: Inconvenient truth is that men and women have been each other’s most consistent distraction since the beginning of time. To pretend that we don’t know what will happen when men and women are thrown together for prolonged periods in emotionally intense situations defies common sense. Being overly academic and insufficiently adult about adult behavior isn’t just irresponsible but imperiling, and belies the deadly seriousness with which we should want combat units to perform..
    - Evidence 4: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
    - Evidence 5: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected..
    - Evidence 3: 1988 – The DoD convenes its Task Force on Women in the Military and adopts the “risk rule,” which excludes women from combat units or missions which risk exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture..
    - Evidence 4: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
    - Evidence 5: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
    - Evidence 2: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..

","The debate topic is whether women should be prohibited in combat. Those in favor of the proposition present five claims. Firstly, they argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women due to physical differences such as less muscle density and bone mass. Secondly, they claim that women cannot overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers and cite lower physical fitness standards and higher injury rates. Thirdly, they suggest that women in combat can distract and harm military function by hurting unit morale and cohesion, fostering fraternization, and inciting jealousy or resentment. Fourthly, they propose that women should serve in safer roles such as clerks and nurses, similar to their non-combat roles during World War II. Finally, they argue that women soldier capture is a big concern due to women's perceived lack of mental resilience and resistance to fatigue, as well as their vulnerability to rape. Overall, the supporters of the proposition believe that women in combat would negatively impact military effectiveness and the safety of female soldiers."

United Kingdom that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom .. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest..
    - Evidence 2: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..
    - Evidence 3: According to a Zogby International survey, 70% of Americans say journalism is important to maintaining community quality of life, and 67% say the traditional media are out of touch with what citizens want from their news..
    - Evidence 4: Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting..

We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,chatgpt,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
    - Evidence 2: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 3: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
    - Evidence 4: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
    - Evidence 2: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 3: Rockets and spaceflight instruments do not assemble themselves. They are designed and built by people, who get paid. They are fabricated from components which have to be manufactured and then purchased. The community engaged in the space industry includes specialist scientists and engineers, designers, graphic artists and IT professionals, as well as a vast support system: HR, catering, cleaning, etc..
    - Evidence 4: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
    - Evidence 5: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
    - Evidence 2: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 3: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
    - Evidence 4: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.

    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
    - Evidence 3: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
    - Evidence 4: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..

- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe..
    - Evidence 3: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
    - Evidence 4: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
    - Evidence 5: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars..
    - Evidence 2: Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence..
    - Evidence 3: An artist’s concept of New Horizons during the spacecraft’s planned encounter with Pluto and its moon Charon. The craft’s miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and space plasma experiments would characterize the global geology and geomorphology of Pluto and Charon, map their surface compositions and temperatures, and examine Pluto’s atmosphere in detail..
    - Evidence 4: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
    - Evidence 5: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more. We're constantly evolving and finding new ways to add value..
    - Evidence 2: Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA’s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations..
    - Evidence 3: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 4: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..

    - Evidence 2: Space Exploration for the Survival of the Human Race.
    - Evidence 3: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
    - Evidence 4: Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites – which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path – to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns..
    - Evidence 5: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..

","The debate topic is whether we should subsidize space exploration. The positive supporters argue that space exploration has multiple benefits, including colonizing resources on other planets, improving science and technology, financial benefits, necessary for the future survival of humanity, and unraveling information about the universe. 

One of the main benefits of space exploration is the potential for colonizing resources on other planets, which can supply clean energy, new homelands, and an expanded ecological niche for humans. It can also provide a new future for our children. 

Space exploration can also improve science and technology by acting as a catalyst for the development of new technologies, and research in basic sciences. In addition, satellite imagery and climate data support sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. 

Furthermore, space exploration is financially beneficial and can create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. The global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. 

Another important aspect of space exploration is that it is necessary for the future survival of humanity, as innovations from space exploration can help us harness a more sustainable world. For instance, technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air, and more can be utilized on Earth as well. 

Lastly, space exploration unravels information about the universe, which is essential to top-level science and the answers to many fundamental scientific questions. The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems. 

Therefore, based on these arguments and evidence, subsidizing space exploration is crucial as it has multiple benefits that can improve human life, our economy, and ensure the future survival of humanity."

","Proponents of subsidizing vocational education argue that it is a worthy cause, but opponents have put forward several claims to the contrary. Firstly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more important programs, such as early childhood education and higher education. This claim is supported by several pieces of evidence, including studies by the Urban Institute and the National Bureau of Economic Research. Secondly, opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education is expensive and can compete with other priorities for funding and resources. This claim is supported by evidence from the Center for American Progress and the National Conference of State Legislatures. Thirdly, opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions, as seen in Germany and Switzerland. Finally, opponents argue that vocational education is not a good career choice, as it often leads to low-wage jobs with limited opportunities for advancement. This claim is supported by evidence from the National Skills Coalition and the American Federation of Teachers."

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying supporters argue that the recent trends towards the use of the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland and press stories regarding botched suicides and do-it-yourself advice would be stopped because individuals would know that when and if they wished to finally request an assisted death in the UK, it would be available as arranged..
    - Evidence 3: A qualitative study using narrative interviews was conducted throughout the UK. Results shows that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most people. Those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a right. Some had multiple reasons, including pain and anticipated pain, fear of indignity, loss of control and cognitive impairment. Those who did not want to be a burden also had other reasons for wanting euthanasia. Suicide was contemplated by a few, who would have preferred a change in the law to allow them to end their lives with medical help and in the company of family or friends..
    - Evidence 4: Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment..
    - Evidence 5: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient..
    - Evidence 2: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 3: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..

    - Evidence 2: Dame Joan Bakewell, the British government's 'Voice of Older People', said that the current British law on assisted suicide was 'a mess' and that Nitschke should have been made more welcome in the UK..
    - Evidence 3: The use of Advanced Decisions can help significantly but they also believe that if a right to an Assisted Death is available then the very knowledge of this fact can alleviate many of the worries an individual might have..
    - Evidence 4: Dignity in Dying argue that if a person does not wish to take advantage of a change in the law which would allow for an assisted death then that is down to personal choice..
    - Evidence 5: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..

    - Evidence 2: Opponents have presented a story of Oregon resident Jeanette Hall, who was diagnosed with cancer and given 6 months to a year to live. She wanted the act of assisted death to be performed..
    - Evidence 3: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 4: Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned..
    - Evidence 5: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
","The opponents of the stance that assisted suicide should be a criminal offence have presented several arguments. Firstly, they argue that assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it. Dignity in Dying, a campaign group, believes that terminally ill, mentally competent adults should be able to opt for an assisted death subject to strict rules and safeguards. They argue that this would prevent people from travelling to Switzerland to end their life prematurely, and it would give dying people control over their death. Secondly, they argue that assisted suicide reduces suffering, as seen in a ruling by a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution. Thirdly, opponents argue that people should have the freedom to choose to end their life, and that the current law on assisted suicide is "

    - Evidence 4: In 1994, a suit was filed in New York claiming that the anti-assisted suicide statute was a violation of equal protection and liberty guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. This claim was rejected by the District Court on the basis that there is no right to assisted suicide given by the U.S. Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
    - Evidence 2: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..

Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:

    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
    - Evidence 5: nan.

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 3: “Differentiation is what homeschooling is all about,” Sherry Bushnell told me. She and herhusband founded the National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, an internationalorganization that supports parents who educate special-needs children at home. They homeschool their sonJordan, a 13-year-old boy with Down's syndrome, along with his nine siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
    - Evidence 5: The efficiency of homeschooling – and the fact that you don’t have to follow the national curriculum or the typical timings of a school day – leaves you with time to spend broadening your child’s learning. You can make time for play, projects, real experiments, and the arts. Real-life skill building – including cooking, cleaning, volunteering, and learning to budget – could form a part of your school day. You could also choose to learn in different places, like museums, parks, and science centres..

    - Evidence 2: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 3: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.

Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Unschooling contrasts with other forms of home education in that the student's education is not directed by a teacher and curriculum..
    - Evidence 2: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 3: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 4: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although we acknowledged in the advantages section that homeschooled children do still develop socially, they naturally lose some interaction by spending more time at home. They may be out of touch with their peers, have fewer friends, and have less experience interacting with people from different backgrounds. Their view of the world could be very narrow and biased. In the worst cases, they could be brought up to be intolerant and misinformed, with little knowledge of general societal values. This could disadvantage them in the future..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 3: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse..
    - Evidence 2: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 3: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 4: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..

","The debate is on whether homeschooling should be banned or not. The positive supporters of the idea of banning homeschooling presented four main arguments. Firstly, they claim that homeschools cannot be regulated or standardized, leading to poor quality education and the potential for abuse. The lack of oversight and regulation may lead to the denial of education to as many as 15-20,000 kids. Secondly, mainstream schools are essential to developing social skills, as schools offer work experience opportunities, sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward, which homeschooled children do not experience. Thirdly, mainstream schools are of higher educational quality since teachers in public schools are required to carry education degrees and have more experience working with and teaching children. Finally, parents are not qualified as teachers, and taking up the role of both parent and teacher could potentially lead to abuse or neglect of the child. Overall, the positive supporters argue that homeschooling should be banned as it is not an effective or safe alternative to mainstream schools."

- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, and a “small possibility” exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disorder in which the person’s immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system, in about one or two per million people vaccinated..
    - Evidence 2: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..

","The opponents of mandatory routine child vaccinations present three main claims. Firstly, they argue that these vaccinations or their side effects can be dangerous, citing examples such as the pneumonia caused by the chickenpox vaccine and the higher instances of bowel obstruction caused by the rotavirus vaccine. Secondly, they claim that mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights, including the right to free exercise of religion and the right to bodily integrity. Thirdly, they argue that routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy, as natural infection may provide more complete immunity than vaccinations. However, the opponents do not provide sufficient evidence to support their third claim, while their first and second claims rely on isolated incidents and fail to acknowledge the overwhelming evidence that vaccinations have been proven safe and effective in preventing the spread of diseases."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Two to three million deaths are prevented each year worldwide by vaccination, and an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if all recommended vaccines were used..
    - Evidence 2: In the twentieth century, there were 16,316 deaths from polio and 29,004 deaths from smallpox yearly in the United States; in 2012 there were no reported cases of polio or smallpox..
    - Evidence 3: Diphtheria killed 21,053 people yearly, measles killed 530,217 people yearly, mumps killed 162,344 people yearly, rubella killed 47,745 people yearly, and Hib killed 20,000 people yearly in the twentieth century United States; by 2012 each of these diseases were decreased by 99% because of vaccinations..
    - Evidence 4: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
    - Evidence 5: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 2: The American Academy of Pediatrics states that “most childhood vaccines are 90%-99% effective in preventing disease.”.
    - Evidence 3: According to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization, vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, which equates to roughly 285 children saved every hour..
    - Evidence 4: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..
    - Evidence 5: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 3: Those seeking to enforce compulsory vaccination argued that the public good overrode personal freedom, a view supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905, a landmark ruling which set a precedent for cases dealing with personal freedom and the public good..
    - Evidence 4: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
    - Evidence 5: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 2: As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant..
    - Evidence 3: In the same manner, children receiving vaccines against pneumococcus reduces pneumococcal disease incidence among younger, unvaccinated siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries..
    - Evidence 5: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization (WHO): 'After observation of study populations for periods of up to 20 years in Japan and 10 years in the United States, more than 90% of immunocompetent persons who were vaccinated as children were still protected from varicella.'.
    - Evidence 2: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
    - Evidence 3: Vaccination campaigns helped eradicate smallpox, which once killed as many as one in seven children in Europe, and have nearly eradicated polio..
    - Evidence 4: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..
    - Evidence 5: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..
","Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory for several reasons. First, vaccinations are highly effective in preventing disease. For example, vaccines have reduced deaths from polio, smallpox, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, and Hib by 99% in the United States. Second, vaccinations save lives, as it is estimated that full vaccination of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections. Third, vaccinations are necessary to protect others, as outbreaks of measles and pertussis can occur if the rate of vaccination decreases below 92%. Fourth, vaccinations prevent the spread of viruses and diseases, as demonstrated by the eradication of smallpox and the effectiveness of pertussis vaccines. Finally, children should not suffer from preventable diseases, and vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable diseases such as measles. Therefore, it is important to make routine child vaccinations mandatory to ensure the health and safety of children and communities."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An Online Harms White Paper (April 2019) argued that existing regulatory and voluntary initiatives had 'not gone far or fast enough” to keep users safe.'.
    - Evidence 2: Another California legislation, Senate Bill No. 1001, was signed into law last September and will go into effect in July. It purports to address the role of bots in fake news and advertising. But the law’s definition of “bot” is too broad, and the method it uses is a poor match for the goal it seeks to accomplish..
    - Evidence 3: Legislation has a noticeable gap failing to hold the platform companies accountable for their management in data privacy, and calls to arms by legislators typically come after an identified breach yet quickly lose momentum..
    - Evidence 4: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
    - Evidence 5: Lack of enforcement of the European Union’s data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., has also cast a shadow over the new laws..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Government use of SMMS or 'Social media monitoring software can be used to geographically track us as we communicate. It can chart out our relationships, networks, and associations. It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.'.
    - Evidence 2: On October 18, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was scheduled to begin using personal information collected using social media platforms to screen immigrants arriving in the U.S. The department made this new measure known in a posting to the Federal Register in September 2017, noting that '...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results...' would be included in an applicant's immigration file. This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates..
    - Evidence 3: Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, and can easily lead to censorship..
    - Evidence 4: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..
    - Evidence 5: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The Open Rights Group and the Index on Censorship warned that the proposals could threaten freedom of expression..
    - Evidence 2: But for every voice pushing for tighter restrictions under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, there’s an equal level of pushback arguing that these regulations violate the First Amendment and protected free speech..
    - Evidence 3: Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, and can easily lead to censorship..
    - Evidence 4: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
    - Evidence 5: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
    - Evidence 2: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..

- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As an example, during the recent upsurge in violence in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in May, Palestinian voices were disproportionately undermined by social media company content moderation practices, and there were limited avenues for challenging take-down decisions..
    - Evidence 2: Herbert Lin - Senior Research Scholar, Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University, said:' Government regulation to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation is neither desirable nor feasible. It is not desirable because any process developed to address the problem cannot be made immune to political co-optation. '.
    - Evidence 3: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..
    - Evidence 4: Around the US 2016 election, Russian entities set up and promoted fake Pages on Facebook to influence public sentiment — essentially using social media as an information weapon..
    - Evidence 5: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
","The opponents of social media regulation argue that it is not effective as existing regulatory and voluntary initiatives have not been successful in keeping users safe. Additionally, legislation fails to hold platform companies accountable for their management of data privacy. Social media regulation also harms privacy as government use of social media monitoring software can track individuals' communication, associations, and movements. Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, leading to censorship. Social media regulation can also harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights. The proposals to regulate social media can threaten freedom of expression and violate the First Amendment and protected free speech.

    - Evidence 2: Also in 2020, EPIC and coalition of child advocacy, consumer, and privacy groups filed a complaint urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and penalize TikTok for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act..
    - Evidence 3: Companies are obligated to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act if they know that children under age 13 use their platforms. The law, known as COPPA, gives parents control over what information online platforms can collect about their kids..
    - Evidence 4: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
    - Evidence 5: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: “Platforms should be transparent about their content moderation decisions, prevent dangerous disinformation from going viral and avoid unsafe products being offered on marketplaces,” said Margrethe Vestager, who has spearheaded much of the bloc’s work to regulate the tech industry as the executive vice president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union..
    - Evidence 2: The European Union reached a deal on Saturday on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation..
    - Evidence 3: A recent Gallup poll found that only 37 percent believe “news organizations generally get the facts straight.” This is down from about half of the country who felt that way in 1998..
    - Evidence 4: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
    - Evidence 5: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If we believe news headlines, social media is responsible for many of the major scourges of modern life. It is coarsening our political discourse, leading to polarization and division. It exposes vulnerable people to extremist ideology, driving them toward violence. Social media is addictive, can damage our body image and sense of self-worth..
    - Evidence 2: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 3: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
    - Evidence 4: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'This proportionate new framework will ensure we don’t put unnecessary burdens on small businesses but give large digital businesses robust rules of the road to follow so we can seize the brilliance of modern technology to improve our lives.'.
    - Evidence 5: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Along those lines, Senator Amy Klobuchar has proposed legislation to have the National Science Foundation identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material..
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
    - Evidence 3: Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'We will not allow child sexual abuse, terrorist material and other harmful content to fester on online platforms. Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.'.
    - Evidence 4: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 5: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:

He suggested that most people see government as the proper authority to suppress speech related to violence..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 3: Another rising concern, exacerbated by Cambridge Analytica’s breach of Facebook data, centers on how bad actors access private data from social media platforms and elsewhere and use it to manipulate opinions for the benefit of a few..
    - Evidence 4: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..
    - Evidence 5: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
","The debate topic is whether social media platforms should be regulated by the government.

    - Evidence 2: Moreover, 77% of Americans said the country was now more divided than before the outbreak, as compared with a median of 47% in the 13 other nations surveyed..
    - Evidence 3: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
    - Evidence 4: According to Carothers and O’Donohue, a “powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion renders America’s divisions unusually encompassing and profound..
    - Evidence 5: In their study of polarization across nations, Thomas Carothers and Andrew O’Donohue argue that polarization runs particularly deep in the U.S. in part because American polarization is 'especially multifaceted.'.

    - Evidence 4: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
    - Evidence 5: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045).

    - Evidence 1: The ownership of wealth among households in the U.S. became somewhat more concentrated since the 1980s. The top 10% of households controlled 68.2 percent of the total wealth in 1983 and 73.1% of the total wealth in 2007..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers recently tested 355,000 White and 77,000 Black Americans and discovered a strong link between a fear of diseases and implicit/explicit racial bias. The tests found that 'among white people who are highly averse to germs, images that evoke thoughts of infectious disease also increase bias against African Americans.'.
    - Evidence 3: From the U.S. Census Bureau, the official poverty rate in 2020 was 11.4 percent, up 1.0 percentage point from 10.5 percent in 2019..
    - Evidence 4: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
    - Evidence 5: The United States’ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019—the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany—according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The US has the highest rate of death by guns in the developed world, and more than double the gun ownership rates than Yemen, a country that has been embroiled in a civil war since 2014..
    - Evidence 2: More Americans have been killed by guns since 1968 than soldiers have died in all of America’s wars combined..
    - Evidence 3: An astounding 1.5 million Americans died by gunfire between 1986 and 2017..
    - Evidence 4: A country where, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 253 mass shootings in the country since the beginning of 2019. That’s more shootings than days. Two of those occurred over the weekend in less than 24 hours, first in El Paso, Texas followed by Dayton, Ohio, leaving 31 dead..
    - Evidence 5: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Since 1892, the United States has deported more immigrants (over 57 million) than any other nation..
    - Evidence 2: Nearly three in ten Asian Americans report experiencing racial slurs or jokes since the start of the pandemic, over 6,600 incidents of hate crime (including physical attacks on Asian elders) have been reported nationwide, and six women were murdered at three Asian-owned spas in Georgia in March 2021..
    - Evidence 3: There is an oversimplification of racism in America, because as sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva notes, there can be systemic racism without racists..
    - Evidence 4: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
    - Evidence 5: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..
","Opponents argue that the USA is not a good country to live in. They present several claims to support their argument. Firstly, the USA has unfair health and education policies. Evidence shows that many adults struggle to afford healthcare costs, with those in lower-income households, Black and Hispanic adults, and uninsured adults being more likely to face difficulty affording healthcare. Additionally, a significant number of children are without health insurance. Secondly, the USA has a problematic political system that is increasingly divisive. Evidence shows that political divisions have intensified over time, with different types of identities becoming 'stacked' on top of people's partisan identities. As a result, the USA is deeply polarized, with divisions running particularly deep due to a powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion. Thirdly, the USA has a negative culture. Evidence suggests that the US has an insane work culture, misuses digital technology, spreads false information, has high sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. The US also has little respect for one another, with most people only concerned about their own social status. Fourthly, the USA has high taxation and a high cost of living. Evidence shows that Americans with lower incomes pay a much higher percentage of their income in taxes than those with higher incomes. Prices of some goods and services have risen substantially, particularly healthcare, childcare, and education, crowding out spending on other categories and leading to financial insecurity for many. Finally, the USA has significant inequality and poverty, with a concentration of wealth among the top 10% of households and rising poverty rates. Evidence also suggests that the USA is unsafe due to its high rate of gun-related deaths and mass shootings. Lastly, the USA is xenophobic and racist, with high levels of deportations and hate crimes towards Asian Americans, as well as systemic racism in the labor market."

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
    - Evidence 2: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 3: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of clerical celibacy answer that God only calls men to the priesthood if they are capable. Those who are not called to the priesthood should seek other paths in life since they will be able to serve God better there..
    - Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 3: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption..
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of celibacy claim that Roman Catholic priests suffering sexual temptations are not likely to turn immediately to a teenage boy simply because Church discipline does not permit clergy to marry..
    - Evidence 5: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 3: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..

- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
    - Evidence 3: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..

    - Evidence 1: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
    - Evidence 2: Among the early Church statements on the topic of sexual continence and celibacy are the Directa and Cum in unum decretals of Pope Siricius (c. 385), which asserted that clerical sexual abstinence was an apostolic practice that must be followed by ministers of the church.
    - Evidence 3: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..

","The opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy argue that celibacy allows priests to focus on God, as evidenced by Paul VI's teachings on the choice of a closer relationship with Christ, the increased spiritual solitude, and the special gift of dedicating oneself to God. Celibacy is also a strong religious belief, as demonstrated by its high esteem from the Church's beginnings, its codification in canon law, and its popularity among religious communities. Additionally, celibacy makes priests appear holy, as shown in the Council of Carthage's decrees on continence and chastity. The opponents argue that priests choose to be celibate as Paul favored celibacy as a gift. Finally, they argue that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, citing many religious in the Church who value celibacy and early Church statements on sexual continence and celibacy. Moreover, abandoning celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, as evidenced by the report by the Catholic church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia and the Archbishop of Vienna's statement."
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its positive supporters argue that:

    - Evidence 2: The forerunner of the CƒåSH was the Jednota (Union of the Catholic Czechoslovak Clergy), which was founded in 1890 to promote modernist reforms in the Roman Catholic Church, such as use of the vernacular in the liturgy and the adoption of voluntary rather than compulsory clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 3: In a radio interview given on March 10, 2009, Egan stated that clerical celibacy in the Latin Rite could be open to discussion [REF]..
    - Evidence 4: Priestly celibacy is a practice rather than required dogma, and many at the time had expected that it might be relaxed together with other practices..
    - Evidence 5: Lakeland believes that Clerical celibacy should become optional and that change is inevitable..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Protestant apologists further argue that clerical celibacy violates the Biblical teaching in the First Epistle to Timothy:. The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
    - Evidence 3: Men are driven by testosterone to want sex, says John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University. Women are driven to a lesser degree by a mixture of testosterone and oestrogen, he explains. ’I'd regard celibacy as a totally abnormal state.’ Around 80-90% of men masturbate and it's likely that priests do too, he says. There is data to suggest that men who ejaculate more are less prone to prostate cancer, he says. You could argue that it's not so healthy to be celibate..

","The debate topic is whether the vow of celibacy should be abandoned or not. The positive supporters argue that celibacy should be abandoned because it is outdated, too pressuring and difficult, unhealthy and unnatural, leads to wrong sexual behavior, and reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. The evidence supporting these claims includes historical evidence of shaky mandatory priestly celibacy, hardship endured by nuns, suppression of urges or hiding of sexual behavior warping people, the violation of Biblical teachings, the conflict between priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy, celibacy being an abnormal state and unnatural act in nature, allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic priests, priestly celibacy being a contributing factor to sex abuse scandals, and the refusal of some to be ordained as priests due to the vow of celibacy. Therefore, the supporters argue that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned in order to modernize the church and increase the number of priests."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: One  of  the  factors  that  influence  adolescent  psychological  well-being  is  the role  of  family and  parents.  In  general,  parental  marriage  contributes  to  the  well-being  of  children  (Ribar, 2015) because  of  the financial  support between  husband and  wife, social  interaction between family members, and  stability  of  the relationship  between  parents who  are  bound  in marriage commitments.  Shek  et  al.  (2014)  found  that  parental  marital  conditions,  family  functioning, relationships  between  children  and  parents,  and  communication  patterns  affect  the  level  of psychological well-being  of  adolescents..
    - Evidence 2: Children raised in intact married families tend to earn higher grades than those in non-intact families.1) For example, kindergarten children from married families have higher reading scores than those from cohabiting families.2) Parents in always-intact married families are also more likely to help their children do their homework than are parents in stepfamilies or single-parent families,3) and fathers in always-intact married families are more involved in their children’s homework than are stepfathers.4) Compared with children in stable married families, students experiencing parental divorce have lower academic expectations and test scores.5).
    - Evidence 3: Plenty of research indicates that healthy marriage positively impacts children and society. And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, it’s possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages..
    - Evidence 4: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 5: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization..
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church..
    - Evidence 3: Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually..
    - Evidence 4: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 5: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Even middle-aged people, who generally tend to be unhappier than people in other stages of life, according to Science Daily, were able to enjoy an elevated level of happiness if they were married. Marriage may help ease the causes of a mid-life dip in life satisfaction and the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived, Helliwell explained..
    - Evidence 2: It’s not marriage that makes you happy, it’s happy marriage that makes you happy, Gilbert said. Married people are happier than unmarried ones, perhaps because the single best predictor of human happiness is the quality of social relationships. Marriage seems to buy you a decade or more of happiness, Gilbert said..
    - Evidence 3: Other recent research, however, has challenged this pessimistic view. Data from a large British panel survey show that marriage increased long-run happiness, suggesting that selection isn’t the whole story. Perhaps marriage doesn’t make Germans happy, but it does seem to make the English happy. Likewise, a paper using panel data from Taiwan has found somewhat more durable positive effects of marriage (though this there was a lot of variety in happiness trajectories, and Christians might get more happiness from marriage than other people)..
    - Evidence 4: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 5: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly..
    - Evidence 2: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult.
    - Evidence 3: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 4: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
    - Evidence 5: Each decision you as a couple can successfully make together brings you closer to each other..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage..
    - Evidence 2: One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill..
    - Evidence 3: There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married..
    - Evidence 4: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 5: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..
","The opponents of abandoning marriage argue that there are several reasons why we should not abandon it. Firstly, marriage benefits children by providing financial support, social interaction, and stability to the family. Research has shown that children raised in intact married families tend to do better academically, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be abused, use drugs or commit delinquent behavior, and have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married. Secondly, marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons. Throughout history, governments have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Marriage is also a spiritual and emotional union that mirrors the one between God and His Church. Thirdly, marriage makes people happy. Research has shown that married people are happier than unmarried ones, and the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived. Fourthly, marriage makes the couple closer by creating a sense of trust and satisfaction in the relationship. Finally, marriage provides important financial benefits such as income splitting, tax-free transfer of money and assets, and tax deductions for health insurance premiums."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Roughly one in three girls in Zimbabwe is married by her eighteenth birthday. Discriminatory social norms that link a girl’s perceived “purity” to her family’s honor are among the factors that push girls into marriage. According to Human Rights Watch, young women and girls who become pregnant, stay out late, are seen in the company of suspected boyfriends, or are otherwise thought to be sexually active can be forced into marriage in order to preserve their familial honor..
    - Evidence 2: Paul Dolan claims that women might be happier if they stay single..
    - Evidence 3: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
    - Evidence 4: Unmarried women tend to be happier, healthier, and live longer didn't come as a surprise..
    - Evidence 5: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Alison, for instance, found that her husband would go out with his friends at the weekend while she stayed at home, preparing lessons and doing the housework. Then there are factors that have the capacity to bring everything to a head. Money is one. “He’d say, ‘Well, you chose to have a low-paid job,’” Alison says. By then they’d had a (planned and wanted) baby, and children are another acknowledged marriage stressor. They bring high strain (in terms of finances, fatigue and housework) and often highlight different standards of care. “It wasn’t an easy time,” Alison says. “It reinforced just how different we were. Before, when we argued, I just thought, ‘Well, we’ll make up a few hours later.’ But when you’ve got a child, you don’t want to be falling out all the time..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 3: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
    - Evidence 4: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..

- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 3: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
    - Evidence 4: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 5: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","The supporters of the idea to abandon marriage argue that there are several reasons to do so. Firstly, marriage preserves harmful norms that discriminate against women. For example, in Zimbabwe, many girls are forced into marriage to preserve their family's honor. Additionally, unmarried women tend to be happier, healthier, and live longer than married women. Secondly, marriages are often unstable and result in divorce due to factors such as different expectations within the marriage and high levels of strain caused by children and finances. Thirdly, marriages tie people up with unfair obligations, such as laws in Qatar that require women to have male guardian permission to marry and permission to work or travel. Finally, most of the advantages of marriage can be achieved through a monogamous relationship, which fosters emotional intimacy and reduces the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, abandoning marriage would lead to greater freedom and equality for individuals, especially women."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
    - Evidence 3: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to the long study and governments statistics gathered children are at higher risk if they “are perceived as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, wearing glasses or different clothing, being new to a school, or being unable to afford what kids consider 'cool.'.
    - Evidence 2: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 3: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
    - Evidence 4: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: B.R. international Public School shows that alongside featuring unity, uniforms likewise promote equality. Envision the circumstance without school uniforms. Students would show up in garments of their decision. Regardless of the amount we attempt, this will ingrain inequality- kids from rich foundations would wear their marked garments and adornments, while other students would build up a feeling of inadequacy..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 3: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
    - Evidence 4: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result..
    - Evidence 3: One study showed that 70% of principals believed that mandated school uniforms reduced disciplinary problems at their schools..
    - Evidence 4: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
    - Evidence 5: by taking their focus away from their attire and their peers’ thoughts, uniforms help students concentrate on their classwork (NASSP Bulletin)..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
    - Evidence 3: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..

- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The people who make up the rules for uniform requirement have false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same. That sounds more like a post-apocalyptic society in which we are all forced to think the same and have no choices in our lives from the day we are born, similar to novels such as Anthem and Fahrenheit 451..
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..

    - Evidence 1: Based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'.
    - Evidence 2: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 3: According to Dr. Alan Hilfer, child psychologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, this may lead to situations in which teenage students start resenting uniforms, undermining the whole purpose of the measure..
    - Evidence 4: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 5: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The article called ‘ School Uniforms,’ stated 'Many parents may have to make financial sacrifices or rely on financial aid to pay the tuition at a private school. In such cases, expensive uniforms can be viewed as a financial burden that disproportionately affects students from low-income households. Some vendors have gained reputations for filling orders slowly and providing poor customer service while charging exorbitant prices.'.
    - Evidence 2: In a study of consumer costs of uniforms and whether money is actually saved, researchers found that uniforms do not replace kid's clothing, and parents actually ended up spending more money on clothes when uniforms are required..
    - Evidence 3: 95 percent of parents think school uniforms cost too much. About 16 percent said they’ve had to cut back on food and other essentials to pay for uniforms, and 13 percent said its pushed them into debt..
    - Evidence 4: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, many types of clothes popular among female students (especially during hot weather) are considered to be “sexually suggestive” (“School dress codes,” 2017, para. 7). According to the proponents of such rules for teenage girls, short skirts and similar clothes contribute to sexual crime in schools (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 2: Dr Johanna Reidy from Otago’s Department of Public Health says girls are forced to wear uniforms that stop them from being active during breaks or cycling to school..
    - Evidence 3: A researcher from the University of Otago says a radical redesign of uniforms is needed.  Students are often made to wear school uniforms that leave them too hot in summer, too cold in winter and are physically restrictive for girls..
    - Evidence 4: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
    - Evidence 5: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..

Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
    - Evidence 2: According to Grace Chen of the Public School Review, forced conformity may leave students ill prepared to enter the adult world where appearance matters even if uniforms are not required..
    - Evidence 3: 'School uniforms only reinforce the notion that authority and obedience matter most, which does not factor into dressing appropriately for a job in an adult career field' contends Scott Key of Fresno State University..
    - Evidence 4: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
    - Evidence 5: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","The debate is centered on the proposition that we should abandon the use of school uniforms. The positive supporters have put forward several arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they argue that school uniform harms learning and creativity. The proponents of this argument cite evidence that suggests that school uniforms are often imposed based on false beliefs that conformity is important and creativity is not. Additionally, strict dress codes infringe on students' self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity. 

Secondly, the supporters argue that school uniform is harming the student's self-expression. The evidence cited to support this argument is that school uniforms undermine the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and expression.

Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..

    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
    - Evidence 3: Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals..
    - Evidence 4: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 5: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","The opponents of abolishing capital punishment argue that it serves a purpose in providing closure and justice for victims' families and loved ones. Supporters of the death penalty also claim that it is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, and it prevents crimes by serving as a deterrent. They argue that it sends a message to potential criminals that they could face the death penalty if they commit heinous crimes. Furthermore, studies have shown that capital punishment has a deterrent effect, saving lives and reducing murder rates. However, no evidence is presented for the third claim that the death penalty prevents crimes."

    - Evidence 3: In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of people with mental retardation in Atkins v. Virginia, ruling that the practice constitutes cruel and unusual punishment..
    - Evidence 4: Execution is the ultimate, irrevocable punishment: the risk of executing an innocent person can never be eliminated. And such mistakes cannot be unmade. Since 1976, 143 US death row prisoners have been exonerated completely for their crimes..
    - Evidence 5: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..

    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
    - Evidence 3: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..

    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 2: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
    - Evidence 3: Nick Petersen, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Miami, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: Social science research does not support the contention that the death penalty deters crime. In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that “available studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.” A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion. Citing a number of problems with deterrence research, the council reported that “claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgments about capital punishment..
    - Evidence 4: John J. Donohue III, JD, PhD, Professor of Law at Stanford University, stated the following in his Aug. 8, 2015 article There’s No Evidence That Death Penalty Is a Deterrent against Crime, available at theconversation.com: There is not the slightest credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the rate of homicide. Whether one compares the similar movements of homicide in Canada and the US when only the latter restored the death penalty, or in American states that have abolished it versus those that retain it, or in Hong Kong and Singapore (the first abolishing the death penalty in the mid-1990s and the second greatly increasing its usage at the same), there is no detectable effect of capital punishment on crime. The best econometric studies reach the same conclusion… Last year roughly 14,000 murders were committed but only 35 executions took place. Since murderers typically expose themselves to far greater immediate risks, the likelihood is incredibly remote that some small chance of execution many years after committing a crime will influence the behaviour of a sociopathic deviant who would otherwise be willing to kill if his only penalty were life imprisonment. Any criminal who actually thought he would be caught would find the prospect of life without parole to be a monumental penalty. Any criminal who didn’t think he would be caught would be untroubled by any sanction..
    - Evidence 5: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
","The supporters of abolishing capital punishment argue that it is fundamentally wrong for the state to sanction killing, as it is an ultimate denial of human rights. There is also a risk of executing an innocent person, and the death penalty is often applied unfairly, with people of color being more likely to be executed. Furthermore, the death penalty harms the disenfranchised and is a waste of taxpayer funds with no public safety benefit. Additionally, the death penalty is irreversible, and studies do not show that it is a deterrent to crime. Therefore, it is time to abolish the death penalty."

    - Evidence 3: The basic public policy rationale for the protection of intellectual property is that IP laws facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovation into the public domain for the common good, by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights to exploit their works and invention for a limited period..
    - Evidence 4: Relying on the concept of the author, copyright is based on the assumption that without an intellectual property rights regime, authors would have no incentive to further create, and that artists cannot produce new works without an economic incentive..

    - Evidence 3: A great number of jobs and industries are dependent on intellectual property and many people could benefit from better control and enforcement of their IP rights..
    - Evidence 4: IP-intensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added (price minus material cost) per employee than non-IP-intensive industries.
    - Evidence 5: These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs..
","The opponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that it is essential to incentivize creativity and innovation, as evidenced by the fact that the protection of IP facilitates and encourages the disclosure of innovation for the common good. Moreover, without a significant period of legal protection, valuable books and artworks would not be created. IP rights also incentivize investment in developing new products, as IP policy is an increasingly important tool for stimulating economic growth, and many types of intangible assets would be under-produced without such protection. IP rights also protect against stealing and provide financial incentives for the creation of investment in intellectual property, generating more value-added per employee than non-IP-intensive industries.

    - Evidence 2: In 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court struck down a New York law requiring parties interested in purchasing a handgun for the use of self-defense outside of the home to obtain a license because the law issued licenses on a “may-issue” rather than a “shall issue” basis. This “may issue” licensing method allowed state authorities to deny interested parties public use licenses for firearms if the interested party was unable to show “proper cause” as to why they have a heightened need for self-protection over the general population..

    - Evidence 2: A Secret Service analysis found that of 24 mass shootings in 2019 at least 10 (42%) involved illegally possessed guns..
    - Evidence 3: According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who “used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence” obtained the gun from a family member or friend..
    - Evidence 4: 'Guns do fall into the wrong hands,' Commissioner Ramsey said, adding that many guns used by criminals were originally purchased legally..
    - Evidence 5: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Marjorie Sanfilippo, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children’s behavior around guns, stated, “We put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves. Because children are naturally curious and impulsive, and because we have shown time and again that we cannot ‘gun-proof’ them with education, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children.”.
    - Evidence 2: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2021, unintentional shooting deaths accounted for over 4% (2,007) of total gun related deaths (44,912) in the United States..
    - Evidence 4: A study from 2014 showed that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm..
    - Evidence 5: A 2001 study found that regardless of age, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns..
","The topic of the debate is whether we should abolish the right to keep and bear arms. Supporters argue that banning guns would save lives, as evidenced by studies showing that states with higher gun ownership levels have higher rates of homicide and assaults with a firearm. They also argue that gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence, and that guns can fall into the wrong hands, leading to theft and illegal possession. Finally, they argue that guns lead to accidental deaths, particularly among children and adolescents, and that victims of unintentional shootings are three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are warning signs that acute budget and service pressures can encourage a retreat to silos or ‘passing the buck’, particularly at the operational level..
    - Evidence 2: The UK’s largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has documented a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. In that decade this food bank network went from distributing just under 26,000 parcels a year to handing out more than 1.33 million of them..
    - Evidence 3: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
    - Evidence 4: “Taking care of ‘at risk’ children is a mandatory concern. However, youth centres and outreach services are considered unessential and have been cut to the bone. Yet these are services that help prevent children becoming ‘at risk’ in the first place,” said Gray..
    - Evidence 5: “For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
    - Evidence 3: For instance, interest rates on Greek debt fell following its first bailout. However, the gains were limited to the government having decreased interest rate expenses. Although the private sector was unable to benefit, the major beneficiaries of lower rates are large corporations. Consumers benefited only marginally from lower rates, but the lack of sustainable economic growth kept borrowing at depressed levels despite the lower rates..
    - Evidence 4: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
    - Evidence 5: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government should listen to the people being pushed into poverty by its policies. Universal credit is failing miserably, leaving families in debt, [in] rent arrears and at risk of becoming homeless. Three million children are growing up in poverty despite living in a working household..
    - Evidence 2: Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots – Denise Hunter, 57, at the West End food bank in Newcastle-on-Tyne.
    - Evidence 3: I got hungry because I was smelling the other food. I had to take my eyes away from it. The most unfair thing is the government knows families are going through hard times but they decide not to do anything about it – John Adebola-Samuel, 12, whose family couldn’t get school meals in Dumfries, Scotland, because of their immigration status.
    - Evidence 4: I was 18 [and homeless] and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work. I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing – Tayah, west London..
    - Evidence 5: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
    - Evidence 3: Because the evidence shows that austerity strangled the green shoots of economic recovery that were sprouting when the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition took office..
    - Evidence 4: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
    - Evidence 5: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers..
    - Evidence 2: Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%..
    - Evidence 3: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
    - Evidence 4: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
    - Evidence 5: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","The opponents of adopting an austerity regime argue that it should not be implemented for several reasons. Firstly, austerity cuts access to essential services, such as welfare for children and families, which has already faced a 44% decrease in public expenditure cuts. Youth centers and outreach services that help prevent children from becoming "

- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 2: If budget deficits are not cut, it can lead to higher bond yields (e.g. in case of Greece, Spain and Ireland)..
    - Evidence 3: After 2009 recession, many European and US economies faced record levels of peace-time deficit. The UK budget deficit was over 10% of GDP, causing a rise in national debt..
    - Evidence 4: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
    - Evidence 5: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: If policymakers and the electorate show sufficient resolve, carrying through with austerity will eventually be rewarded by better financing conditions. Austerity pays off in the long run..
    - Evidence 4: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..

- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Astute monetary policy and falls in international commodity prices are given by a recent World Bank overview, as reasons for this relatively steady growth in the services and industrial sectors, enjoyed by Morocco and reflected in the country’s GDP..
    - Evidence 2: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 3: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
    - Evidence 4: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..

- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Almost a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis, national debt in advanced economies remains near its highest level since World War II, averaging 104 percent of GDP. In Japan, the ratio is 240 percent and in Greece almost 185 percent. In Italy and Portugal, debt exceeds 120 percent of GDP. Without measures either to cut spending or increase revenue, the situation will only get worse..
    - Evidence 2: The most commonly proposed austerity measures in the IMF loans include wage bill cuts and freezes (31 countries), increases to or the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) (14 countries), and general public expenditure cuts (55 countries)..
    - Evidence 3: David Cameron used his speech at the Scottish Conservative conference over the weekend to hit back. He said: 'Our opponents bleat on about austerity but I tell you – if we don’t get a grip of these debts, they will grip us.'.
    - Evidence 4: The budget deficit was 11% of GDP in 2009-10. It is now about 5.5% and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of UK predicts a surplus by the end of the decade..
    - Evidence 5: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Despite its negative reputation concerning its commitment to reforms and its implementation record, Greece has put forth an immense effort over the last three years and indeed has taken impressive steps toward achieving fiscal sustainability, with occasionally remarkable results. In the three years since the beginning of the crisis, it implemented a fiscal tightening of some 20% of GDP (around €50bn, while it has committed to measures cumulatively totalling €65bn by 2015) and reduced its budget deficit by an impressive nine percentage points, despite having lost a fifth of its GDP since 2009..
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.

    - Evidence 2: As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film The Golden Compass, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be watered down from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says denigrates Christianity and promotes atheism for kids, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief..
    - Evidence 3: The report also criticized the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship; they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'..
    - Evidence 4: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..

    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..
    - Evidence 3: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..

","The opponents of adopting atheism present three main claims. Firstly, they argue that atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. This claim is supported by various examples such as John Locke's belief that atheism undermines social order and a boycott of a film by Donohue, who believed that it promotes atheism and denigrates Christianity. Secondly, they argue that atheism lacks morality, and belief in God is necessary for individuals to lead a morally responsible life. This claim is supported by Douglas Wilson's argument that atheists can behave morally but cannot give a coherent account of why they are obligated to do so. Lastly, they argue that people should choose for themselves whether to adopt atheism or not, as it is a personal choice that should not be forced upon individuals. This claim is supported by various pieces of evidence, such as the European Court of Human Rights finding that people cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behavior associated with a particular religion and the freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs, subject to certain limitations prescribed by law."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: Being an atheists often comes with contradictory ideologies that the society thrusts upon people but on the inside, atheists are free of conflicting ideas. They do not need to debate almost every time some stranger comments or offends any religion for they not believe in religion. They do not ever get into heated debates about which religion is better than the other..
    - Evidence 3: They believe in scientific explanations and do not dwell on mythologies that are most of the time impossible to believe in unless you are a blind follower. Their reasons and concepts are clear and they are happy about whatever they believe to be true. Satisfaction at heart is the most important thing people seek and atheism brings it in the most literary and non-mythical way..
    - Evidence 4: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
    - Evidence 5: I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A few years ago, in a conversation with fellow atheist Peter Boghossian, Richard Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
    - Evidence 3: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 4: Theodore Drange (2006)  has developed an argument that if God were the sort of being that wanted humans to come to believe that he exists, then he could bring it about that far more of them would believe than currently do.  God would be able, he would want humans to believe, there is nothing that he would want more, and God would not be irrational.  So God would bring it about that people would believe.  In general, he could have brought it about that the evidence that people have is far more convincing than what they have.  He could have miraculously appeared to everyone in a fashion that was far more compelling than the miracles stories that we have.  It is not the case that all, nearly all, or even a majority of people believe, so there must not be a God of that sort..
    - Evidence 5: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
    - Evidence 3: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
    - Evidence 4: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
    - Evidence 3: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
    - Evidence 4: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The supporters of adopting atheism argue that it is beneficial for individuals, as atheists have a superior basis for ethics and are free from conflicting ideologies and gory details of religious beliefs. Moreover, they believe in scientific explanations and are satisfied with their clear concepts. They should adopt atheism since it cannot be proved that God exists and there is no evidence to justify the belief in God. In addition, religions are immoral and people should not follow them since they are based on lies and set unrealistic expectations, and some religions even teach people to do horrible things. Science can adequately explain the universe, and atheists are more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 2: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
    - Evidence 3: The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others..
    - Evidence 4: Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered..
    - Evidence 5: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
    - Evidence 3: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good..
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 5: nan.

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
    - Evidence 3: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

","The opponents of adopting libertarianism argue that it has negative impacts on economic growth, minorities, justice, and government services. Firstly, they provide evidence that laws and regulations resulting from poor policymaking practices suppress economic growth, resulting in increased inequality. Secondly, they argue that libertarianism allows consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, prioritizes the liberty of the rich over the poor, and requires an endorsement of equality in the distribution of goods and resources. Thirdly, they argue that libertarianism ignores the importance of social cooperation, can lead to unjust outcomes, and can result in unequal outcomes. Fourthly, they claim that libertarianism rejects regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions and environmental degradation, making it difficult to deal with these issues. Finally, they argue that the government is essential in protecting basic human rights, protecting the environment, and providing government services."
We should adopt libertarianism,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism increases economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Sustainability advocates Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins posited in their book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Free-market roads are advocated by libertarians, who consider them more efficient, safer, and more cost-effective than public roads ..
    - Evidence 3: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
    - Evidence 4: James Shikwati (born 1970) is a Kenyan libertarian economist and Director of the Inter Region Economic Network who promotes freedom of trade as the driving solution to poverty in Africa..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians also argue that freedom of speech and expression are crucial for protecting individual freedom. By allowing individuals to freely express their opinions and ideas, a libertarian system can promote greater diversity of thought and promote greater understanding and cooperation. For example, First Amendment scholar Floyd Abrams argues that freedom of speech and expression are fundamental to a just and free society.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist F.A. Hayek argues that property rights are essential for allowing individuals to act freely and pursue their own interests..
    - Evidence 3: By allowing individuals and businesses to freely compete, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Adam Smith argues that competition is essential for promoting economic growth and well-being..
    - Evidence 4: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
    - Evidence 5: By allowing individuals to freely associate with others, a libertarian system can promote greater cooperation, understanding, and social support. For example, sociologist Robert Putnam argues that social networks and community involvement are important factors in promoting well-being and happiness..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: So why not prohibit alcohol .. I submit that there is only one why not, and this should be no news to libertarians who presumably believe in inalienable individual rights: namely, that no one has the right to coerce anyone not himself directly engaged in an overt act of aggression against rights..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians within YAF believed, for example, the military draft was a violation of the individual freedom the organization claimed to embrace..
    - Evidence 3: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
    - Evidence 4: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters..
","The debate is about whether we should adopt libertarianism or not. Those in support of adopting libertarianism argue that it increases economic growth, political freedom, happiness/fulfillment, and individual freedom/liberties. Evidence supporting these claims includes the coalescence of libertarianism and green politics, advocacy for free-market roads and reduced taxation, higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth in countries with lower levels of government intervention, promotion of competition and innovation, guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, freedom of speech and expression, the ability to pursue individual interests and goals, and the rejection of alternatives to self-ownership. Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters, believing that it is the central goal of political systems."
We should ban human cloning,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
    - Evidence 3: Cloning can also be used to improve the quality of life for people with certain medical conditions. For example, cloning can be used to create replacement tissues for people with conditions like Parkinson's disease, which can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. A study by the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that transplantation of human stem cells can help to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease..
    - Evidence 4: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research.

For example, a study by the National Institutes of Health found that human tissue cloning can help to reduce the need for animal testing..
    - Evidence 5: Cloning can also be used to advance medical research in a number of different areas. For example, cloning can be used to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments for those diseases. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents claim that human reproductive cloning also would produce benefits.

A study by the Nature Biotechnology journal found that cloning can help to advance biotechnology..
    - Evidence 5: For example, cloning can be used to study the genetic makeup of extinct species and to better understand the processes that led to their extinction. A study by the Journal of Evolutionary Biology found that cloning can help to better understand the process of evolution..
","The opponents of the ban on human cloning have presented various arguments to support their stance. They argue that cloning has several benefits, such as organ replication, customized organ creation, improvement of quality of life for people with certain medical conditions, reduction of animal testing in medical research, advancement of medical research in different areas, and helping those who cannot have a child due to infertility. They also claim that cloning promotes health, science/research, and can be used to produce genetically modified organisms. Therefore, they believe that banning human cloning would have negative consequences and limit the potential benefits that cloning can offer."
We should ban human cloning,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
    - Evidence 3: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..

A broad coalition of States, including Spain, Italy, the Philippines, the United States, Costa Rica and the Holy See sought to extend the debate to ban all forms of human cloning, noting that, in their view, therapeutic human cloning violates human dignity..
    - Evidence 2: The Ministry of Health enacted the Danish Council Act 1988, which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos..
    - Evidence 3: Article 11 of UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights asserts that the reproductive cloning of human beings is contrary to human dignity..
    - Evidence 4: Hwang himself criticised the process, stating that it did not bring science any closer to human cloning and the complexities, coupled with the low success rate (one in 123), did not make it ethical to clone family pets..
    - Evidence 5: In 2001, when Germany and France proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an international convention to ban reproductive human cloning, the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included Spain, Philippines, the United States, and Costa Rica, noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning..

    - Evidence 5: A report by the Congressional Research Service in 2009 found that the lack of accountability surrounding private military companies can lead to actions that prolong and escalate conflicts..
","The debate topic is about whether private military companies should be banned or not. Those who support the ban argue that private military companies are unethical and violate human rights, not professional, cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country, prioritize profit over other considerations, and can encourage or prolong conflict. To support their claims, they cite several pieces of evidence, including reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Congressional Research Service, and the United Nations. The evidence includes examples of criminal activities, unlawful killings, the use of child soldiers, mistreatment of civilians, and other human rights abuses. The evidence also suggests that private military companies can face a conflict of interest when serving both their clients and broader society, potentially leading to ethical violations and decreased professionalism. Additionally, the evidence suggests that private military companies can prioritize profit over other considerations, including ethical and legal considerations, potentially encouraging or prolonging conflicts. Overall, supporters of the ban argue that private military companies pose a threat to human rights, democracy, and international peace and security, and should be banned to ensure accountability and professionalism in the military sector."

Secondly, child performers achieve success and confidence, as evidenced by Ashwin Chitale winning the best child artist award. Thirdly, child performers are necessary for certain roles, which can increase diversity in casting and provide opportunities for more actors, including children. Fourthly, child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision and regulation, and there are already child labor laws in place to protect them. Finally, parents should decide for their child as they have a deep understanding of their children's needs and abilities, and are best equipped to make decisions on their behalf."

    - Evidence 4: In 1997, he published a pseudo-autobiographical novel called The Mao Game about a fifteen-year-old child star attempting to cope with heroin addiction, memories of past sexual abuse, and the impending death of his grandmother, who has been diagnosed with cancer..
    - Evidence 5: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls.

","The debate is centered around whether or not the use of child actors should be banned. The positive supporters argue that the use of child actors should be banned because it is harmful to their education and development, puts them at risk of exploitation, robs them of their childhood, causes high levels of pressure and stress, and often leads to problems later in life. The evidence presented includes studies, reports, and real-life examples of child actors who have struggled with the negative effects of their work. These negative effects include developmental delays, emotional difficulties, social isolation, burnout, high levels of stress and pressure, physical and emotional abuse, lack of free time and childhood experiences, mental health issues, and difficulties adapting to adult life."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
    - Evidence 2: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 3: High-Value Enemy Combatant Defined.--In this section, the term  ``high-value enemy combatant'' means an enemy combatant who--(1) is a senior member of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group; (2) has knowledge of an imminent terrorist threat against the United States or its territories, the Armed Forces of the United States, the people or organizations of the United States, or an ally of the United States;  (3) has, or has had, direct involvement in planning or preparing a terrorist action against the United States or an ally of the United States or in assisting the leadership of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group in  planning or preparing such a terrorist action; or (4) if released from detention, would constitute a clear and continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the United States..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..

- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
    - Evidence 3: “The president has been really explicit ... that Gitmo is a very, very important tool,” Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said on Fox News this morning. It's also important to understand that Guantanamo Bay is an incredibly important intelligence asset..
    - Evidence 4: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..
    - Evidence 5: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..
","The opponents of closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp argue that it would harm national security. They present evidence that the remaining detainee population consists of hardened and unrepentant terrorists who pose a risk to national security if transferred to another country. They also point out that a significant percentage of former detainees who have been transferred to other countries are confirmed or suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. Additionally, they argue that the facility is state-of-the-art and provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and provides medical care not available to a majority of the population of the world. They also argue that Guantanamo Bay is essential to gain intelligence on Al Qaeda, including how they recruit, train, equip, finance, and conduct operations. The facility is a secure location away from population centers and provides maximum security required to prevent escape. The Guantanamo Bay detention facility is considered by some as the single greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror. Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility."

- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241..
    - Evidence 3: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
    - Evidence 4: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
    - Evidence 2: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 3: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
    - Evidence 4: Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad..
    - Evidence 5: The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
    - Evidence 3: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..

- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
    - Evidence 2: In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher..
    - Evidence 3: Since Congress decided to pursue austerity in 2011, it has chosen to spend at least $1.42 billion on the mission at Guantanamo, although it could have been accomplished for just $29.9 million..
    - Evidence 4: Simply by transferring the 84 detainees already cleared to leave Guantanamo, the United States could save nearly $2 billion over the next 10 years..
    - Evidence 5: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
    - Evidence 2: The CSRT applies a broad definition of enemy combatant that inevitably ensnares innocent people;  applies a presumption of guilt;  has no juries; disables prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence;  prohibits prisoners from having lawyers;   and relies on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely..
    - Evidence 3: A government report describes the facility as having been “modified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,” with doors that had been “sealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.” Inside, the walls were “covered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.” There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound..
    - Evidence 4: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
    - Evidence 5: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld later approved interrogation techniques in Guantánamo that included sleep deprivation, stress positions, nudity, sensory deprivation and threatening detainees with dogs..
","The supporters of closing Guantanamo Bay detention camp have several claims. Firstly, detainees have the right to trial in US courts as ruled by the US Supreme Court in the case of Boumediene v. Bush. Secondly, the camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions and serves as a symbol of discrimination/injustice, as it has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression. Thirdly, it is expensive to maintain, costing the US more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago. Fourthly, personnel at the camp have committed crimes against the prisoners, such as sexual humiliation, waterboarding, and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees. Lastly, unjust treatment/tactics are used at the camp, such as the CSRT applying a broad definition of enemy combatant, which inevitably ensnares innocent people, disabling prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence, and relying on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely."

    - Evidence 1: Elkins' views were influential during the late 1960s when Daniel Patrick Moynihan, supported Affirmative action programs in order to counteract the lingering effects of slavery on black culture..
    - Evidence 2: An opinion column in the Houston Chronicle after a similar sale took place at Texas A&M University held that 'Actions like these reinforce the common misconception that affirmative action policies give academically unqualified minority students a get-into-college-free card, and they ignore historical discrimination that denied nonwhites opportunities to be successful at any price, no matter their talents or intelligence.'.
    - Evidence 3: Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals..
    - Evidence 4: The justification for affirmative action is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture,[REF] and to address existing discrimination [REF]..
    - Evidence 5: As historian Roger Wilkins has pointed out, Blacks have a 375-year history on this continent: 245 involving slavery, 100 involving legalized discrimination, and only 30 involving anything else (Wilkins, 1995). Jews and Asians, on the other hand, have immigrated to North America—often as doctors, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs, and so forth. Moreover, European Jews are able to function as part of the White majority. To expect Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians is to deny the historical and social reality that Black people face..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve a range of goals: bridging inequalities in employment and pay; increasing access to education; enriching state, institutional, and professional leadership with the full spectrum of society; redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances, in particular addressing the apparent social imbalance left in the wake of slavery and slave laws..
    - Evidence 2: The government claimed that this was an affirmative action scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education..
    - Evidence 3: Affirmative action - provide positive preferential treatment in allotment of jobs and access to higher education, as a means to accelerate the integration of the SCs and STs with mainstream society..
    - Evidence 4: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
    - Evidence 5: Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals..
","The opponents of ending affirmative action put forward three main arguments. Firstly, they argue that affirmative action boosts diversity. Hampshire College president, Ed Wingenbach, argues that diversity matters greatly in institutions that predominantly serve White people. Secondly, affirmative action is necessary to compensate for past discrimination. Historian Roger Wilkins notes that Black people have a long history of discrimination and persecution, and affirmative action is a means to address this historical reality. Thirdly, affirmative action reduces discrimination. It can help to bridge inequalities in employment and education, increase access to opportunities, and correct imbalances in representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories. Overall, the opponents of ending affirmative action argue that it is a necessary policy to promote diversity, address past discrimination, and reduce current discrimination."

    - Evidence 5: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students.

    - Evidence 2: While this system may seem helpful at diversifying campuses on the surface, it is simply putting a Band-Aid on systematic issues..
    - Evidence 3: Affirmative action is peak performative activism, as it focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities..

    - Evidence 2: In Sweden, the Supreme Court has ruled that 'affirmative action' ethnic quotas in universities are discrimination and hence unlawful..
    - Evidence 3: Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticised as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger..
    - Evidence 4: Hardin's last book The Ostrich Factor: Our Population Myopia (1999), a warning about the threat of overpopulation to the Earth's sustainable economic future, called for coercive constraints on 'unqualified reproductive rights' and argued that affirmative action is a form of racism..
    - Evidence 5: Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students.

    - Evidence 4: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university..
    - Evidence 5: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
","The debate topic is whether affirmative action should be ended. Those who support the idea argue that affirmative action should be ended for several reasons. Firstly, affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities and encourages racism against whites. For instance, it can devalue the accomplishments of those who belong to the groups it is intended to help, and this makes it counterproductive. Secondly, affirmative action is ineffective and fails to achieve its intended goals. The evidence suggests that it promotes the upward mobility of privileged African Americans but leaves the less skilled and less educated African Americans behind. Thirdly, affirmative action is not just and only puts a Band-Aid on systematic issues. It's a performative activism that does not focus on ensuring marginalized communities get equal opportunities. Fourthly, affirmative action perpetuates prejudice. Those who oppose the idea contend that it is 'reverse discrimination' and has undesirable side effects. Finally, affirmative action reduces quality. The evidence indicates that programs such as affirmative action and minimum wage laws, which were set up to help minorities, have been harmful to them and stifled their ability to advance in society. In addition, just because BIPOC students are getting into universities does not mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed. Therefore, the supporters argue that affirmative action should be ended."

On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..

- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, said Deepti Choubey, senior director of nuclear and bio-security at the Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington. These are the materials that a terrorist would use to make a kind of bomb that you would use for nuclear terrorism attacks and they are currently spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world..
    - Evidence 2: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
    - Evidence 3: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 4: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
    - Evidence 5: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 2: More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and other NATO countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a single nuclear warning shot, according to a terrifying simulation..
    - Evidence 3: Max Tegmark: Soviet Sub Captain Decides to Fire Nuclear Torpedo During Cuban Missile Crisis To me, this is both harrowing and educational: it shows how great risk can come from the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings that couldn’t start a nuclear war on their own, but can provide the perfect storm when combined. The fact that it remained secret for decades also suggests that there may be recent scary incidents that we haven’t yet heard of..
    - Evidence 4: David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack. Additionally, the fact that it happened so recently highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago..
    - Evidence 5: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
","The supporters argue that nuclear weapons should be abolished because they can fall into the wrong hands, as there are materials that terrorists could use to create bombs spread across the world, and there is a possibility of theft, loss, or hacking. They also argue that nuclear weapons provoke or escalate disastrous military actions, as a nuclear attack could result in the deaths of millions of people, and simulations have shown that even a single nuclear warning shot could cause significant damage. The supporters cite historical events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis and recent incidents of lost contact with missiles as evidence of the dangers of nuclear weapons."

    - Evidence 4: For example, they argue that industrialization supports greater efficiency of agriculture through technology, an advantage for the productivity of rural farmers as well as urban consumers..
    - Evidence 5: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Biodiversity will play an increasingly important role within the urban landscape..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..

    - Evidence 3: In the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and good-quality touristic services, so the fast process of urbanization, had the consequence of irregular neighbourhoods..
    - Evidence 4: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 5: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..
","The debate is about whether or not we should fight urbanization. Those in favor of fighting urbanization argue that it has negative consequences. First, restrictions on migration would benefit people in rural areas economically and socially. Evidence shows that agrarian production has decreased due to the combination of economic decline and increased urbanization, which has left rural areas neglected and abandoned. Second, urbanization causes crime. Evidence shows that there is a shortage of housing and jobs, and an increase in urban crime, poverty, and health problems in urban areas. Third, urbanization harms the environment. Evidence shows that it largely contributes to sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers, pollutes clean water supplies, and degrades the marine environment. Fourth, urbanization is causing a strain on cities' resources, such as roads, drainage, garbage, and sanitation. Evidence shows that there is an increased risk of diagnosed psychosis for people living in the most urbanized environments, inadequate housing, the absence of mass sanitary facilities, and the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odors, disease, and high mortality in large urban groups."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 3: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..

    - Evidence 2: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..

    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 3: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..

Second, citizens have the right not to vote, and mandatory voting violates their freedom of speech and civil liberties. Third, compulsory voting can lead to uninformed or random voting, as people may feel compelled to vote without being adequately informed about the issues or candidates. This can also lead to the use of sensational and misleading advertising by politicians. Finally, not everyone has the ability to go and vote, and some people may be voting based on intentional disinformation."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study finds that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement in several ways..
    - Evidence 2: A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda by up to 20 percentage points..
    - Evidence 3: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Since voting at referendums in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory has been allowed in 1977, compulsory voting has also applied there..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
    - Evidence 3: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 3: A counter argument to opponents of compulsory voting is that in these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot..
    - Evidence 4: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 5: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..
","The topic under discussion is whether or not to introduce compulsory voting. The supporters of the idea present three main arguments in its favor. Firstly, they claim that compulsory voting would increase representation. This is supported by evidence such as a 2016 study that found that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement, and a Swiss canton study that found compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda. Additionally, compulsory voting means that candidates would have to address the needs of all voters and would prevent skewing of the political system towards the well-off and well-educated.

Secondly, supporters argue that compulsory voting would cause more people to become interested in politics. Evidence in support of this includes the fact that compulsory voting has been in place in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory since 1977, and concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission. Compulsory registration and voting would also increase the legitimacy of elected representatives and increase the political education of the people.

Finally, supporters argue that people have an obligation to vote. Evidence supporting this argument includes the fact that compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, and that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms according to the European Court of Human Rights. Opponents of compulsory voting argue that people should have the freedom not to vote, but supporters counter that abstaining is still possible through the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper.

In conclusion, supporters of compulsory voting argue that it would increase representation, generate interest in politics, and fulfill people's obligation to vote."

    - Evidence 2: A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash..
    - Evidence 3: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
    - Evidence 2: Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs..
    - Evidence 3: The Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse..
    - Evidence 4: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
    - Evidence 5: Proponents cite studies such as that of 311 same sex twins, where only one twin smoked cannabis before age 17, and where such early cannabis smokers were five times more likely than their twin to move on to harder drugs..

That figure has remained virtually unchanged since 1975, never dropping below 82.7% in three decades of national surveys..
    - Evidence 3: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 4: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..

They also cite a study that found heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Additionally, they mention a British Lung Foundation study that shows smoking three cannabis joints can cause the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes.

They point to several studies that suggest acute cannabis use increases the risk of automobile crashes. They also refer to a new study that found deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades.

Thirdly, they argue that cannabis is a gateway drug and addictive. They mention a study that examined how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs.

We should legalize cannabis,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: In 2001, the New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group stated that decriminalizing cannabis will result in greater availability of resources to respond to more serious crimes without any increased risks to public safety..
    - Evidence 3: Psychopharmacologist David Nutt argues, though he is against full declassification, that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco, which, if they were invented today would be illegal..
    - Evidence 4: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
    - Evidence 5: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
    - Evidence 3: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart..

The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..

    - Evidence 2: The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many unintended negative consequences of drug enforcement..
    - Evidence 3: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
    - Evidence 4: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
    - Evidence 5: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..

    - Evidence 2: One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana. The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia..
    - Evidence 3: Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes..

Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
    - Evidence 5: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client.

Firstly, legalizing prostitution will increase the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. A study conducted in Athens found that a significant percentage of registered prostitutes were HIV positive, and prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population in developing countries. Secondly, legalizing prostitution will increase immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking. Legalization of prostitution would result in an increase in human trafficking and crime, and many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps. Furthermore, sex trafficking is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking, and a large number of prostitutes are being forced to work and being abused by pimps and criminal gangs. Thirdly, legalizing prostitution will increase violence against women. The general consensus among most studies is that rates of physical violence against prostitutes are extremely high, particularly among female sex workers, who experience higher rates of physical violence than their male counterparts. Lastly, selling one's body is immoral, as prostitution is seen as a form of male dominance over women, reducing women to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client. Therefore, opponents argue that legalizing prostitution should not be pursued."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
    - Evidence 2: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The World Charter for Prostitutes Rights (1985), drafted by the International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights, calls for the decriminalisation of all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decision. Since the mid-1970s, sex workers across the world have organised, demanding the decriminalisation of prostitution, equal protection under the law, improved working conditions, the right to pay taxes, travel and receive social benefits such as pensions..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 3: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
    - Evidence 4: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
    - Evidence 5: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent..
    - Evidence 2: The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person. Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry..
    - Evidence 3: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
    - Evidence 4: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear..
    - Evidence 2: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 3: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 4: Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution in toto, there is some evidence that regulation of China's recreational venues has helped to create a legitimate female service worker with the right to refuse to engage in practices repugnant to the valid labour contract, as well as the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace..
    - Evidence 5: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
    - Evidence 2: For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word prostitution to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term criminal sexual acts..
    - Evidence 3: Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will. Most women make this decision themselves..
    - Evidence 4: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 5: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..
","The supporters of legalizing prostitution argue that it should be legalized because it will boost the economy, increase sex workers' benefits such as health care and safe sex, allow regulation of those in the profession, make the profession safer for women, and that sex work is a valid choice over one's body. They provide evidence that shows that brothels can be functional and generate revenue for cities, that sex workers demand better working conditions and the right to pay taxes, and that decriminalization or legalization would allow sex workers to be treated the same as any other self-employed person. Additionally, studies show that regulation and decriminalization can make the profession safer for women and reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Lastly, supporters argue that prostitution is not inherently bad and should be viewed as a profession, so long as it is a consensual decision made by the individual."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society . Charles Lockwood of Yale says, a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars..
    - Evidence 2: When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences..
    - Evidence 3: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
    - Evidence 4: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
    - Evidence 5: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son, while a deeply rooted son preference makes many families want a son..
    - Evidence 2: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
    - Evidence 3: In addition, primary care physicians voiced the concerns that sex selection led to invasive medical interventions in the absence of therapeutic indications, contributed to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex, and was not a solution to domestic violence..
    - Evidence 4: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
    - Evidence 5: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 3: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
    - Evidence 4: Under the tradition of son preference and the one-child policy, missing females in China are formed through sex-selective abortion, discrimination in care for females, and non-registration of girls at birth..
    - Evidence 5: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
","The opponents of legalizing sex selection put forward several arguments. Firstly, they believe that sex selection can lead to gender imbalance. This is supported by evidence showing that a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars. Moreover, it is suggested that the rise in sex selection reflects the persistent low status of women and girls and has a damaging effect on societies. 

Secondly, the opponents argue that sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases. This is supported by evidence showing that girls have become unwanted in countries like China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son. Additionally, the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology has allowed prenatal discrimination to spread, contributing to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex. 

Thirdly, the opponents argue that sex selection will create abortions and infanticide. This is supported by evidence showing that parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child, and compulsory measures such as the one-child policy in China have resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide. Moreover, although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions. 

Overall, opponents of legalizing sex selection argue that it has several negative consequences and is not a solution to any existing problems."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Most families opt for unisex stuffs for babies before they are born. From clothes to toys, the color of the crib to the various necessities and accessories, everything is gender neutral in most cases. With gender selection or knowing baby’s gender can help every family to buy gender specific items. This not only does away with the ambiguity but actually helps the baby to get the best stuff as well. There is also a financial aspect as after the birthing of a baby, the parents always spend money on items that are for a boy or girl respectively. Knowing the gender or choosing gender allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The economic advantage is not oft talked about but it is significant..
    - Evidence 3: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
    - Evidence 4: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 4: There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire..
    - Evidence 5: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 3: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..

    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The debate is focused on the legalization of sex selection and its positive supporters argue that it should be legal. The first argument in favor of sex selection is that it is within the freedom of parents to select the sex of their child. This can be fulfilled with gender selection, which can help in instilling gender balance in the family and allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The second argument is that sex selection allows for better family planning, as parents can raise the number of children they want, and it gives them effective control over the number of children they want. This can also help couples to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire. The third argument is that sex selection makes the family more happy and complete, as it can be a comforting option for parents who have lost a child and can make the family happier by fulfilling their desire for a specific gender. The fourth argument is that sex selection can prevent diseases in the child through preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection. Finally, sex selection can prevent abortions and infanticide, as it can fulfill the desire of parents for a specific gender and prevent the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies. Therefore, the supporters argue that sex selection should be legalized as it offers numerous benefits to parents and the family."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In common usage, the phrase 'flag burning' refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest..
    - Evidence 2: In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7-2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:  In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth..
    - Evidence 3: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 5: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
    - Evidence 3: Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
","The opponents of prohibiting flag burning argue that it is an effective tool of expression, protest, and critique, protected under the First Amendment. They provide evidence to support their claims, including the landmark case of Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, which recognized the right to engage in symbolic speech through armbands as protected under the First Amendment. Similarly, the case of Texas v. Johnson found that burning the American flag was also protected under the First Amendment. They argue that flag burning is justified as a form of free expression and that the government should not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive or disagreeable. Therefore, the opponents of prohibiting flag burning believe that it should remain protected under the First Amendment."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Under the 1983 Turkish flag law, burning the flag is strictly forbidden, punishable by a prison sentence of three years..
    - Evidence 2: Chief Justice Warren wrote that while the First Amendment does protect freedom of speech, it does not protect all things that may extraneously be labeled 'symbolic speech.
    - Evidence 3: In Austria flag desecration is illegal under Â§248 Strafgesetzbuch..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Rehnquist argued that flag burning is no essential part of any exposition of ideas but rather the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 4: According to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The topic of the debate is whether we should prohibit flag burning. The positive supporters argue for the prohibition of flag burning by presenting two claims. The first claim is that flags are important symbols that should be respected, supported by evidence such as laws in Turkey and Austria that forbid flag burning, and the argument that new physical fitness standards in the military should be gender-free to assess the capability of soldiers for specific roles. The second claim is that flag burning is an inflammatory act, supported by evidence that burning flags is an offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed and that it is used to antagonize others. Overall, the positive supporters argue that prohibiting flag burning is necessary to show respect for important symbols and prevent inflammatory acts."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls and makes our communities safer and healthier. It is a human right and it is good for the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations. Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy. In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy..
    - Evidence 3: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
    - Evidence 4: Twenty-five years after the United Nations’ Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action pledged to take the necessary steps to “remove all obstacles to gender equality and the advancement and empowerment of women,” support for gender equality is strong around the globe. Across 34 countries surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 94% think it is important for women in their country to have the same rights as men, with 74% saying this is very important..
    - Evidence 5: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: As a health professional and a researcher, Mar Nagel found that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions. They have better social and communication skills than men, possess strong memory, are sophisticated and show precision and fast reaction and response time..
    - Evidence 3: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
    - Evidence 4: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
    - Evidence 5: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address..
    - Evidence 2: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 4: The more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed..
    - Evidence 5: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Nindl, et al. (p. 51, 2016), training programs increased the number of pull-ups that women were capable of, demonstrating that they could overcome their naturally smaller muscle mass. Additionally, their research found that women performed better than men in ultra-endurance, or the ability to physical endure for a given extended period of time. These studies suggest that women excel in some abilities, and that while men are indeed stronger as a physical typicality, there are exceptions and other ways that women can compete..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
    - Evidence 3: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 4: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
    - Evidence 2: In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty..
    - Evidence 3: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 4: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
    - Evidence 5: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
    - Evidence 2: Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country..
    - Evidence 3: While fewer women might achieve such levels, as Jon Soltz, notes: There are women who can meet these standards, and they have a right to compete..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
","The opponents of the proposition that women should be prohibited in combat put forward several arguments. They assert that gender equality is a human right and that it helps prevent violence against women and girls. Women's impact is not limited to individual companies and organizations as increasing women's participation in the economy is good for the economy. They also argue that women are an asset in combat and can bring unique skills and strategies, such as their ability to communicate, their strong memory, and their resilience to psychological effects. Women are just as capable as men in combat, and history has shown that women have proudly served in the military. Moreover, women should be allowed to serve in combat if they choose to and as long as they pass the tests, just like men. The opponents conclude that if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team, and it is a matter of individual assessment."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
    - Evidence 3: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
    - Evidence 4: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
    - Evidence 2: In an interview with CNN on January 4, Maj. General Robert Dees, the campaign chair for Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, said he didn’t think it was a good idea: “If you look at the population demographics, most women…cannot properly carry a 230-pound soldier—with a rucksack and combat vest on—off of the battlefield to save his life..
    - Evidence 3: While the majority of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves.  In addition, combat units engage in activities designed to suit men’s capabilities. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this..
    - Evidence 4: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
    - Evidence 5: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: While it may be a feel-good move for many progressives, the end result might well be to lower the standards for all troops and damage the quality of the military..
    - Evidence 2: Lower female standards also reinforce the belief that women cannot perform the same job as men, therefore making it difficult for women to earn the trust and confidence of their teammates..
    - Evidence 3: Inconvenient truth is that men and women have been each other’s most consistent distraction since the beginning of time. To pretend that we don’t know what will happen when men and women are thrown together for prolonged periods in emotionally intense situations defies common sense. Being overly academic and insufficiently adult about adult behavior isn’t just irresponsible but imperiling, and belies the deadly seriousness with which we should want combat units to perform..
    - Evidence 4: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
    - Evidence 5: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected..
    - Evidence 3: 1988 – The DoD convenes its Task Force on Women in the Military and adopts the “risk rule,” which excludes women from combat units or missions which risk exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture..
    - Evidence 4: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
    - Evidence 5: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
    - Evidence 2: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The debate revolves around the topic of prohibiting women in combat. The positive supporters of this idea believe that men are better suited to combat roles than women, and there are several reasons behind it. Firstly, women are physically smaller than men, have less bone mass, less muscle density, and have a harder time achieving and sustaining high levels of fitness. This makes it difficult for them to carry heavy loads and meet the fitness standards required in combat. Secondly, women cannot overcome physical, emotional, or mental barriers that arise during sustained combat, and their inclusion can harm the quality of the military. Thirdly, mixed-gender teams can create distractions and foster petty rivalries, thus impacting unit morale and operational effectiveness. Fourthly, women should serve in safer roles, and there are many other non-combat roles in the military that women can perform efficiently. Finally, women soldier capture is a big concern, and history shows that female soldiers captured in wars have been subjected to rape. Overall, prohibiting women in combat would be the right decision as it would ensure that the military is functioning at its optimal level without any distractions or harm to its quality."

United Kingdom that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom .. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest..
    - Evidence 2: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..
    - Evidence 3: According to a Zogby International survey, 70% of Americans say journalism is important to maintaining community quality of life, and 67% say the traditional media are out of touch with what citizens want from their news..
    - Evidence 4: Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting..

We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
    - Evidence 2: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 3: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
    - Evidence 4: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
    - Evidence 2: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 3: Rockets and spaceflight instruments do not assemble themselves. They are designed and built by people, who get paid. They are fabricated from components which have to be manufactured and then purchased. The community engaged in the space industry includes specialist scientists and engineers, designers, graphic artists and IT professionals, as well as a vast support system: HR, catering, cleaning, etc..
    - Evidence 4: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
    - Evidence 5: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
    - Evidence 2: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 3: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
    - Evidence 4: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
    - Evidence 3: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
    - Evidence 4: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..

","The opponents of subsidizing space exploration have presented several arguments. Firstly, they argue that space exploration can be carried out by the private sector, as evidenced by successful ventures by companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic. Secondly, they argue that space exploration is expensive, with costs ranging from $10,000 to $700 million per launch, and there are significant R&D costs as well as costs associated with assembling and maintaining the spacecraft. Thirdly, they argue that space exploration is ineffective and scientifically useless, with the exception of satellite technology, which has had a beneficial effect on our world. Lastly, they contend that there are issues more important to fund than space exploration, such as poverty, global warming, reducing crime rates, and finding cures for diseases. Therefore, they believe that government subsidies for space exploration should be discontinued."
We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,chatgpt,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe..
    - Evidence 3: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
    - Evidence 4: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
    - Evidence 5: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars..
    - Evidence 2: Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence..
    - Evidence 3: An artist’s concept of New Horizons during the spacecraft’s planned encounter with Pluto and its moon Charon. The craft’s miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and space plasma experiments would characterize the global geology and geomorphology of Pluto and Charon, map their surface compositions and temperatures, and examine Pluto’s atmosphere in detail..
    - Evidence 4: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
    - Evidence 5: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more. We're constantly evolving and finding new ways to add value..
    - Evidence 2: Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA’s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations..
    - Evidence 3: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 4: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Every year, about a thousand technical innovations generated in the space program find their ways into our earthly technology where they lead to better kitchen appliances and farm equipment, better sewing machines and radios, better ships and airplanes, better weather forecasting and storm warning, better communications, better medical instruments, better utensils and tools for everyday life..
    - Evidence 2: Space Exploration for the Survival of the Human Race.
    - Evidence 3: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
    - Evidence 4: Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites – which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path – to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns..
    - Evidence 5: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration of our solar system and distant galaxies in the furthest reaches of the Universe is important to top-level science and the answers to many fundamental scientific questions including formation of the Universe, the origin of Earth, Evolution of life, and the Existence of life beyond the Earth. Space robotics plays a critical role in the current and future space exploration missions, and enables mission-defined machines that are capable of surviving in the space environment, and performing exploration, assembly, construction, maintenance, or servicing tasks..
    - Evidence 2: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
    - Evidence 3: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..
    - Evidence 4: space exploration, investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches of the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
