Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
","Opponents of criminalizing assisted suicide make a strong case for personal autonomy and dignity in their arguments. They argue that assisted suicide ensures the preservation of personal dignity, which is affirmed by organizations like “Dignitas” in Europe and the “Washington Death with Dignity Act” in America, showing the concept's alignment with popular intuition. This alignment is further supported by academic defenses of assisted suicide, which frequently reference “death with dignity.” They also argue that assisted suicide can alleviate suffering, citing criteria of due care that healthcare professionals use to guide these decisions. These criteria are centered on the patient's unbearable suffering and the lack of reasonable alternatives, which underpins the potential for assisted suicide to alleviate suffering. The principle of autonomy is underscored by the argument that people should have the freedom to end their life. This is particularly evident in the practice of physician-assisted suicide or physician aid-in-dying (PAD), where physicians provide the means for competent, suffering patients to end their own life, a distinct practice from 'active euthanasia.’ Finally, opponents argue that the terminally ill, such as those facing progressive diseases, could significantly benefit from assisted suicide. This argument is exemplified by the personal accounts of individuals like Pratchett, who wished to resort to assisted suicide before his disease became critical."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide allows people to solicit someone to die to their own benefit.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The patient must be an adult and in a 'futile medical condition of constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated'. The patient must have a long-term history with the doctor, with euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide only allowed for permanent residents..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide should not be allowed because many times people can still get better.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made..
- claim_3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text..
- claim_4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
","Supporters of criminalizing assisted suicide argue that assisted suicide has potential for misuse, allowing individuals to solicit death for their own benefit. They refer to certain stringent requirements, like the patient's long-term history with the doctor and permanent residency, as essential safeguards to prevent such misuse. They contend that assisted suicide may be resorted to prematurely, when patients could still recover. Instances of depression, fear of being a burden, or fear of dependency could be signs that not all therapeutic efforts have been exhausted, and assisted suicide may be seen as a premature solution. The role of healthcare professionals is another central point, as they argue that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role. The potential risks of doctors becoming facilitators of a patient's death are considered to significantly outweigh any potential benefits of assisted suicide. The argument extends to the constitutional realm, where they argue that individuals do not have the right to harm themselves or others, a claim backed by interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment. Lastly, they emphasize the potential for a slippery slope effect in the euthanasia debate. They argue that allowing physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia may lead to the acceptance of non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia, practices currently deemed unacceptable."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The agency provides Eastern York Schools, district home schooled students and area private schools many services including: Special education services, combined purchasing, and instructional technology services..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
","Opponents of a homeschooling ban present a diverse range of arguments centered around individualization, safety, parental rights, and the potential benefits of a home learning environment. They cite examples of special education services and combined purchasing, arguing that homeschooling is the best option for exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students. They highlight the potential for homeschooling to be tailored to the child's pace and needs, as illustrated by Gosling's personal account of homeschooling fostering a strong sense of autonomy. Concerns about violence and bullying in mainstream schools form another crucial part of their argument. They advocate homeschooling as a safer alternative for children who may be at risk in the conventional school environment. The rights of parents to choose the education of their children form another core argument. They assert that homeschooling allows parents a deeper understanding of their children's progress and the liberty to integrate their familial and cultural values into the education process. They also argue that the home can be an effective learning environment, offering broader socialization and active learning opportunities that are not always possible in a typical classroom setting."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
","Supporters of a ban on homeschooling point to stories like Vyckie Garrison's, a mother of seven who after 18 years of homeschooling, found herself unable to ensure a quality education for her children. Her struggle is a poignant reflection of the lack of standardization and regulation in homeschooling, especially as she lived in Nebraska, a state with little homeschooling regulation. Additionally, supporters assert that mainstream schools are indispensable for the development of crucial social skills. They illuminate the experiences unique to conventional schools, such as work experience opportunities, participation in sports leagues, and public recognition, which homeschooled children may not encounter. Quality of education is another major point of contention. Supporters often reference the opposition to homeschooling by established organizations like the National Education Association, illustrating their argument that mainstream schools provide a superior quality of education. Finally, they dispute the qualifications of parents as teachers. Referencing Professor Rob Reich's work, 'The Civic Perils of Homeschooling', supporters express concern over the potential for students to be exposed to a one-sided point of view, raising doubts about the educational soundness of homeschooling."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'.
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Mayo Clinic states that natural infection 'often provides more complete immunity than a series of vaccinations.'.
","The topic of mandatory routine child vaccinations is a hotly contested one. Those opposing it bring forth several reasons, starting with the potential dangers and side effects associated with vaccines. For instance, the Rotashield vaccine was withdrawn from the market after links to higher instances of bowel obstructions were discovered, providing a chilling example of how vaccines can sometimes go wrong. Opponents also argue that mandating vaccinations would infringe upon the basic rights of individuals. They cite the First Amendment of the US Constitution, arguing that the mandate could interfere with the right to exercise personal and religious beliefs freely. The necessity of vaccinations is another point of contention. Critics point out that, according to the Mayo Clinic, natural infection often provides more robust immunity than a series of vaccinations, challenging the idea that routine vaccinations are essential to keep children healthy."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
","Supporters of mandatory child vaccinations present compelling counter-arguments. They emphasize the efficacy of vaccines, like the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which led to a 69% drop in invasive pneumococcal disease rates in children under two within a year of its introduction. Supporters also underline the life-saving potential of vaccines. An estimation suggests that full vaccination of all US children born in a given year could prevent 14 million infections and save 33,000 lives, highlighting the profound impact of vaccinations. They argue for the larger societal good, stating that routine vaccinations protect not only the individual but the community at large. This point is illustrated by a case where an unvaccinated teenager from the US contracted measles during a visit to Romania and, upon return, triggered an outbreak in a community of unvaccinated children. Moreover, they insist on mandatory vaccinations to prevent the spread of deadly diseases, a strategy proven effective by the eradication of smallpox - a disease that had claimed millions of lives before its eradication. Lastly, supporters maintain an ethical standpoint, insisting that children should not have to suffer from diseases that are easily preventable by vaccines, given that vaccine-preventable diseases cause an estimated three million childhood deaths each year."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
","Opponents of government regulation of social media platforms construct their argument on five main claims. The first claim states that such regulation is ineffective, exemplified by the little action taken against Facebook, Google, and others over their data-collection practices since the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (G.D.P.R.) in 2018. Secondly, critics argue that regulation infringes on privacy, citing a Pew Research Center survey that shows many people feel they have little control over how their personal information is used. Thirdly, they claim that regulation compromises freedom of speech and other democratic rights. This is illustrated by Facebook's significant restriction on Vietnamese content after Vietnam's 2018 cybersecurity law, an act that has been criticized for threatening press freedom. Fourthly, opponents assert that government intervention in the affairs of private companies, like social media platforms, could lead to excess bureaucracy and inefficiency. Lastly, critics caution that regulation could lead to political abuses by the government, pointing to the polarization of voters, lower trust in institutions, and degradation of democracy seen in past politically targeted advertisements."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
","Supporters of government regulation of social media platforms present five key arguments. The first is that regulation safeguards younger audiences, citing an official statement advocating for an independent, statutory regulator to ensure online safety for young people. Secondly, they argue that regulation is essential to combat fake news, referencing a statistic revealing that a majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information. Thirdly, supporters believe regulation benefits society at large, highlighted by proposed legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) that aim to increase transparency and limit psychologically manipulative techniques on social media platforms. Fourthly, proponents contend that regulation can manage negative content, supported by the endorsement of upcoming legislation by the CEO of safety technology company Safe To Net. Lastly, they state that regulation is necessary to deal with malicious users, evidenced by a Pew Trust report showing that 13% of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by unauthorized users."

- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..

","Opponents of the claim that the USA is a good country to live in build their argument on seven claims. First, they criticize the country's health and education policies, citing disparities in healthcare affordability between different racial groups. Second, they highlight problems with the divisive political system, referring to intensified divisions between the two major political parties. Third, they express concerns over the negative culture, using a statement by Tina Marie Griffin on the misuse of digital technology, the spread of false information, and other social pressures. Fourth, they point out the high taxation and cost of living, exemplified by the tax situation for struggling families in Manhattan. Fifth, they emphasize issues of inequality and poverty, illustrated by the fact that 750,000 Americans are homeless on any given night. Sixth, they discuss safety concerns, citing a poll where 65% of people in the USA were worried about violent crime. Finally, they argue that the country is xenophobic/racist, referring to the significant number of hate crimes and racial slurs experienced by Asian Americans since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic."

","Supporters of the position that the USA is a good country to live in base their argument on several key claims, each supported by credible evidence. Firstly, the argument is made that the US has a high standard of living and a robust economy, evidenced by the fact that in 2015, income per capita was $56,300, which is amongst the highest in the developed world. Secondly, they assert that the US has robust health and education systems. As proof, they point out that 40 out of the top 100 universities in a 2014 global survey are based in the US, with 7 in the top 10, suggesting that US diplomas are highly regarded by employers globally. They also argue that the country is rich in natural beauty, using John Muir's famous description of Yosemite as nature’s temple as an example. Moreover, the USA's democratic rights and freedoms are emphasized, as the country's Declaration of Independence is regarded as the first civic document that meets a modern definition of human rights, as stated in the Human Rights: The Essential Reference. The country's multicultural society and cultural richness are also highlighted, with the argument that American culture has been influenced by various regions worldwide, including English, Indigenous Americans, Latin Americans, Africans, and Asians, as reported by the Library of Congress. The claim that the US is a powerful country is backed by the fact that it has been ranked as the world's most powerful country seven times, as per the rankings by the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and US News & World Report. Finally, they argue that the US offers unmatched opportunities for individuals, pointing out that most of the world's largest companies have offices in the US, thus providing unique career opportunities that can be life-changing."
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
","Opponents of the idea that the vow of celibacy should be abandoned make several key claims, supported by relevant evidence. First, they argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God, with Paul teaching that by freeing himself from other obligations, a priest can devote himself more fully to God. Second, they suggest that celibacy is a deeply held religious belief, as underlined by the encyclical written by Pope Paul VI, 'Sacerdotalis caelibatus', which is Latin for 'Of priestly celibacy'. They further argue that celibacy contributes to priests' holiness, as a priest's love that chooses a celibate life draws from God and is as demanding and real as any other genuine love. Fourth, they claim that priests consciously choose to be celibates, as seen in the example of several religious figures who have publicly taken vows of celibacy. Fifth, they uphold that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained, arguing that clerical continence is part of an immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. Lastly, they express concern that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, with the Archbishop of Vienna making a connection between celibacy and the sex abuse scandals in the Catholic church."
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
","In the debate on the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', the proponents articulate their stance with the following arguments and evidence. Firstly, they posit that celibacy is outdated. This is backed by historical evidence where Pope Paul III commuted the vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity for the knights of the order in 1540, indicating a precedent of modification to the rule in line with societal evolution. Secondly, they contend that celibacy can be excessively pressuring and difficult. A real-life testimony by Jimmy O'Brien highlights the psychological strain, describing celibacy as a lifestyle made difficult by sexual chemistry and the lack of a life partner. Thirdly, proponents argue that celibacy is unhealthy and unnatural. They underscore the basic biological principle that all living organisms are biologically programmed to reproduce, implying that celibacy goes against this natural imperative. Fourthly, they claim that celibacy can lead to inappropriate sexual behavior, pointing to the alarming statistic that in 2004, over 1,000 allegations of sexual abuse were made against Catholic priests and deacons in the U.S. Lastly, the argument is made that celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests. This is supported by the statement of Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck, an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, who endorsed the ordination of women and cessation of clerical celibacy in response to a shortage of priests."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
","In the debate on the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', opponents argue with the following points and supporting evidence. Firstly, they assert that marriage is beneficial for children. Evidence presented reveals that children profit from gender-specific support a mother and father can provide. Research indicates that the distinctive roles of mothers and fathers, as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are crucial for child development. Secondly, they uphold that marriage is significant for individuals, either for general reasons or due to religious/traditional beliefs. They use strong evidence showing that children raised in a healthy marriage witness and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family, thereby emphasizing the societal importance of this institution. Thirdly, they propose that marriage enhances happiness. This claim is backed by research indicating that married people are generally happier than those who are not married. Fourthly, they state that marriage makes couples closer. They cite a survey that found married adults were more satisfied with their relationships and had greater trust in their partners than cohabiting couples. Lastly, they argue that marriage provides key financial benefits. They provide multiple examples, including potential tax benefits, enhanced savings opportunities, better insurance options, and long-term social security benefits, demonstrating that marriage can confer significant financial advantages."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
","In the debate on the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', the proponents make the following arguments backed by evidence. Firstly, they claim that marriage perpetuates harmful norms for women. They support this assertion with evidence highlighting the imposition of rigid gender roles in marriage. Women are often expected to be submissive to male family members, conform to their wishes, and forego equal decision-making. They face potential physical violence if they deviate from these norms. Secondly, they argue that marriages are unstable. This is supported by data from the United Nations, which indicates a global increase in divorce rates since the 1970s. The proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s, demonstrating the instability inherent in modern marriages. Thirdly, proponents contend that marriage binds individuals with unfair obligations. An example from Qatar's laws is provided as evidence, where women need male guardian permission to marry, to work, or even to travel. If women are deemed disobedient for not obtaining their husband's permission for these actions, they can lose their right to financial support, illustrating the potential for institutionalized inequity in marriage. Finally, they argue that most advantages of marriage can be achieved in a monogamous relationship without the formal institution of marriage. This claim is backed by the observation that monogamy is ingrained into many societies and is seen as a dominant approach to love and partnership, suggesting that the emotional and social benefits of marriage can be realized without the contractual binding."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
","In the debate regarding the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', those opposed to the idea present the following arguments with supporting evidence. The first claim is that children can still express themselves using other means, even with uniforms. A former student from Hershey High School backs this assertion, arguing that uniforms do not suppress individuality. Students can still express their personalities through various items such as buttons or jewelry. The second claim states that school uniforms reduce instances of bullying. The Department of Education (DofE) presents evidence that schools strictly enforcing uniform policies have fewer incidents of bullying. This is because potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who are often children who do not fit in. Thirdly, it's argued that school uniforms create a sense of equality and unity among students. The reasoning is that uniforms not only standardize appearances but also instill a sense of community and belonging. This sense of unity boosts school pride and spirit. The fourth claim suggests that school uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning. There is evidence that students in uniforms are more academically focused, which minimizes disciplinary problems and allows teachers to focus on teaching rather than dress code enforcement. Lastly, opponents argue that school uniforms save costs. A recent NY Post article suggests that families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes. Over a 12-year career, this can amount to significant savings, which can be utilized towards college expenses."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","Conversely, the proponents for abandoning school uniforms argue as follows. First, they claim that school uniforms harm learning and creativity. This is supported by Tara Maginnis Ph.D., who argues that uniforms convey the message that conformity is prioritized over creativity, stifling students' right to expression. Secondly, they claim that school uniforms harm students' self-expression. A study from Arizona State University supports this argument, showing that students without school uniforms had a higher self-perception. Thirdly, proponents assert that school uniforms are expensive. This adds a financial burden on families already struggling with the increasing costs of bills and essential items. Fourth, they argue that school uniforms are often uncomfortable and promote sexist standards. A GLSEN study provides evidence that a significant percentage of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes thought to be of another gender, limiting their comfort and expression. Finally, they claim that school uniforms increase conformity and harm individuality. Research indicates that allowing kids and teens to dress as they choose not only fosters independent thinking but also prepares them for adulthood where they have to adapt to varying social standards and contexts."

    - Evidence 1: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..

The first claim is that the death penalty helps victims and their families. This point is supported by Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, who believes that enforcing capital punishment is a step closer to providing justice and closure for victims' families and loved ones.

We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
","On the other hand, proponents for the abolition of capital punishment present their case as follows. The first claim is that state-sanctioned killing is principally wrong. Evidence indicates that the application of the death penalty in the US is unfair and unjust, disproportionately affecting people based on their financial status, the quality of their legal representation, the victim's race, and the crime's location. Additionally, there is a risk of executing innocent people, with over 156 people having been released from death rows due to proven innocence since 1973. Secondly, they assert that the death penalty harms the disenfranchised. A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts shows that the cost of a federal death penalty case is significantly higher than that of a non-death penalty case, diverting resources that could be allocated to programs better suited for increasing public safety, health, and welfare. Lastly, they argue that the death penalty is irreversible and does not effectively deter crime. Freelance author Emmaline Soken-Huberty supports this argument by stating that no studies show capital punishment as a deterrent. In fact, states without the death penalty have lower murder rates. Therefore, she concludes, given the death penalty's risk to innocent lives and lack of crime prevention efficacy, it should be abolished."

- claim_1: Banning guns would save lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death”.
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
- claim_3: Guns can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
","On the contrary, proponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that: Firstly, intellectual property prevents the continuous improvement of a product or service. Evidence suggests that the assertion of intellectual property rights, as in the case of Fox Talbot in 1852, can hinder the development of industries, like photography. Secondly, intellectual property restricts access to vital information or products. Professor Lessig critiques the modern law-making process, claiming it has been hijacked by corporations more interested in capital accumulation than the free exchange of ideas. Thirdly, they argue that intellectual property rights are unfair. The People's Health Movement (PHM) considers the agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) as unjust and against the interests of developing countries and poor patients. Fourthly, intellectual property rights can harm creativity and innovation. Again citing the case of Fox Talbot in 1852, proponents argue that the insistence on economic rights in intellectual property can hamper development. Fifthly, intellectual property rights are a waste of money. Initial protection can be expensive, especially for complex products involving methods, designs, and processes. Finally, they posit that intellectual property rights are ineffective. Some argue that unlike physical property, intellectual property isn't scarce and its legal protection is a fiction created by the state."

- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Nationally, local authority budgets were cut by nearly a third from 2010 to 2018, according to the UK National Audit Office and the public health grant fell by £700m in real terms between 2014/15 and 2019/20, as revealed by a Health Foundation report. Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,.
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","The debate on the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms' can be intense and multifaceted.  Opponents of the proposition argue that: Firstly, gun control is ineffective. They point to a 2016 Obama administration study which found that only about 10.1% of prison inmates obtained their firearms through a retail source, implying the majority of firearms used in crimes are obtained illegally, regardless of gun laws. Secondly, they contend that gun ownership is a right. They cite the U.S. Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller, which reaffirmed the Second Amendment as establishing an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms. Thirdly, they argue that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sport shooting. They support this claim with data from 2016 showing approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, with more than half of all hunters participating in target shooting. Finally, they argue that gun ownership promotes self-protection. A 2019 Gallup survey found that 63% of gun owners cited personal safety or protection as their primary reason for owning a firearm."

- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..

- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes.

The Congressional Research Service in 2009 attested to their specialized training programs, which keep them updated with the latest tactics and techniques. Thirdly, we argue that these companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies are unable or unwilling to do. The same study from Defense and Security Analysis found that these companies offer specialized skills and expertise that might be lacking in the regular army. Lastly, we maintain that private military companies can increase safety. According to a report by the Heritage Foundation, these companies can efficiently use resources, thus reducing the overall cost of military operations and allowing a greater focus on safety. Given these arguments and the supporting evidence, we strongly oppose the notion of banning private military companies."
We should ban the use of child actors,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban the use of child actors', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Being a performer harms the child's education.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the Journal of Education and Practice in 2013 found that child performers often miss school or receive inadequate education, leading to a lack of basic skills and knowledge..
- claim_2: Child performers are at risk of exploitation.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the Journal of Adolescence in 2012 found that child performers are often subject to labor violations, including wage theft, lack of breaks, and poor working conditions..
- claim_3: Child performers are losing their childhood.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A report by UNICEF in 2016 found that child actors are often exploited and exposed to unhealthy working conditions, leading to the loss of their childhood..
- claim_4: Child performers have a lot of pressure.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014 found that child performers may experience mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, due to the pressure and stress associated with their work..
- claim_5: Child performers tend to develop problems later in life.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
","We wholeheartedly support the motion to ban private military companies. We base our argument on the grounds that these companies often exhibit less ethical behavior, lack professionalism, have questionable loyalty, prioritize profit over integrity, and may incite or prolong conflicts. Our first contention is that private military companies are often less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes. The United Nations reported in 2004 that these companies had used child soldiers in conflict zones. Secondly, we argue that private military companies lack professionalism. A report by Amnesty International in 2009 indicated that these companies have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, leading to increased risk and a drop in professionalism in their operations. Thirdly, we maintain that these companies cannot be trusted to remain loyal to the hiring country. A study in the Journal of Military Ethics in 2009 found that these companies can face a conflict of interest if they have loyalty to multiple countries. Fourthly, we assert that private military companies primarily focus on profit, often at the expense of ethical conduct. A study in International Affairs in 2010 showed that these companies often operate with limited accountability, impeding efforts to hold them responsible for profit-driven actions. Lastly, we posit that private military companies may provoke or prolong conflicts for their financial gain. The Project on Government Oversight in 2008 found that these companies have a financial incentive to prolong conflicts due to their continued involvement. Given these compelling arguments and evidence, we stand firmly with the motion to ban private military companies."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
","We contest the motion to ban the use of child actors. We argue that acting can be a child's passion, that child performers can achieve success, that they provide diversity in casting, that they can thrive under proper supervision, and that their involvement in acting should be a decision made by their parents. Our first argument is that acting can be a child's dream. The Drama Teachers Association of America found that many children have a natural talent for acting, and may even aspire to make it their career. Secondly, we argue that child performers can gain success and confidence through acting. For instance, Ashwin Chitale received the best child artist award. Thirdly, we maintain that child actors are necessary for certain roles. The National Association of Theatre Owners found that child actors diversify casting and create opportunities for more actors, including children. Our fourth argument posits that child performers can thrive as long as there is adequate supervision and regulation. For example, Walsh collaborated with child actors to illustrate potential dangers and the solutions children can seek. Lastly, we argue that parents should have the autonomy to decide for their child. The Journal of Family Psychology found that parents are capable of providing individualized attention and care crucial for the child's development and well-being. Given these compelling arguments and evidence, we stand firmly against the motion to ban the use of child actors."

Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
","We ardently support the motion to ban the use of child actors. We argue that being a performer negatively impacts the child's education, exposes them to the risk of exploitation, results in the loss of their childhood, puts them under intense pressure, and may lead to problems later in life. Our first contention is that being a performer can harm a child's education. The Journal of Education and Practice found that child performers often miss school or receive inadequate education, compromising their basic skills and knowledge. Secondly, we argue that child performers are at risk of exploitation. A study in the Journal of Adolescence highlighted that child performers often face labor violations, including wage theft and poor working conditions. Thirdly, we maintain that child performers are often robbed of their childhood.

Fourthly, we posit that child actors face immense pressure. A study in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence found that child performers might develop mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, due to work-related stress. Lastly, we contend that child actors often develop problems later in life. The story of Herbert, a child actor who faced difficulties adjusting to life beyond the studio, illustrates this point. Given these compelling arguments and supporting evidence, we strongly stand with the motion to ban the use of child actors."
We should end affirmative action,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
","We argue against the motion to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. We posit that the camp is essential for national security, provides better conditions than alternatives, and plays a crucial role in gathering intelligence. Firstly, closing Guantanamo Bay could risk national security. The Director of National Intelligence reports that around 17.5 percent of transferred detainees reengage in terrorist activities. This implies a significant threat of terrorism resurgence. Secondly, Guantanamo Bay offers superior conditions for detainees than alternative detention centers. As per various sources, including human rights organizations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, the facility adheres to the Geneva Convention and exceeds the standards of maximum-security prisons worldwide. Thirdly, the detention camp is a crucial asset for intelligence gathering in the war against terror. Its strategic position and design make it a valuable source of insight into Al Qaeda's operations, further enhancing the United States' counterterrorism efforts. Given these reasons, we firmly oppose the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp."

- claim_1: Affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some opponents believe, among other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2010 Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107 [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action is not just.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..
- claim_4: Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Opponents,[REF] who sometimes say that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination', further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects in addition to failing to achieve its goals..
- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
","We ardently support the motion to close Guantanamo Bay detention camp. We assert that detainees should have access to US courts, the camp tarnishes US image and reputation, it symbolizes discrimination and injustice, it drains significant financial resources, its personnel commit crimes, and it employs unjust treatment tactics. Firstly, we argue that detainees deserve a trial in U.S courts. The Supreme Court ruled that Guantanamo detainees have rights under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision, reaffirming the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty.’ Secondly, the detention camp damages the reputation of the United States. As a symbol of lawlessness, Guantanamo undermines our commitment to the rule of law and serves as a recruitment tool for terrorists. Thirdly, Guantanamo represents a symbol of injustice and discrimination. Originally set up as an 'island outside the law,' it has devolved into a symbol of abuse and disregard for the rule of law. Fourthly, maintaining Guantanamo Bay is exorbitantly expensive. With costs exceeding $540 million annually, the facility's operation drains resources that could be better utilized elsewhere. Fifthly, Guantanamo personnel have been accused of committing crimes against detainees. Reports of abuse, torture, and inhumane treatment reinforce the need for closure. Lastly, the camp uses unjust treatment and interrogation tactics. Approval of techniques such as stress positions, isolation, deprivation of stimuli, and 20-hour interrogations violates international human rights norms. Considering these compelling arguments, we strongly urge the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp."
We should end mandatory retirement,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end mandatory retirement', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: A mandatory retirement age creates opportunities for other workers.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the International Labour Organization in 2012 found that mandatory retirement ages can help boost employment for young people, as older workers are encouraged to leave the workforce and make room for younger workers..
- claim_2: mandatory retirement age benefits those that are about to be retired.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can increase financial security for workers, as they can receive pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a specified age..
","We stand against the motion to end affirmative action. We believe that affirmative action enhances diversity, compensates for past discrimination, and reduces ongoing discriminatory practices. Our first point is that affirmative action fosters diversity. Studies show a significant decline in admission of students of color in highly selective colleges following an affirmative action ban, highlighting its crucial role in promoting diversity. Secondly, affirmative action serves as a necessary corrective for historical and ongoing discrimination. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights clearly defined affirmative action as a measure adopted not just to end discriminatory practices, but to rectify their consequences. Finally, affirmative action aids in reducing discrimination in society. As validated by the case of Johnson v. Transportation Agency, affirmative action corrects 'manifest imbalance' in traditionally segregated job categories, thereby actively combating discrimination. We argue that, given its vital role in promoting diversity and combating discrimination, affirmative action should be maintained."

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that mandatory retirement ages can result in age discrimination, as older workers are forced to retire, regardless of their ability to continue working..
- claim_4: A mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Evidence from Social Security Eligibility by Jonathan Gruber and David Wise, published in The American Economic Review, found that health declines after mandatory retirement, suggesting reduced quality of life..
- claim_5: We should let everyone retire when they are ready.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging, as older workers can continue to contribute to the workforce, using their skills and experience to benefit society..
","We ardently support the motion to end affirmative action. We maintain that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, unjust, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Firstly, we argue that affirmative action undermines the achievements of minorities. The perception that minority accomplishments are due to affirmative action rather than merit fosters disrespect and devalues their genuine efforts. Secondly, affirmative action's efficacy is questionable. As seen with the passing of Arizona's Proposition 107, which bans government-sponsored affirmative action, there is growing consensus that it may not be the most effective approach. Thirdly, affirmative action may sometimes result in unjust practices. An example is the alleged discrimination against Asian-American students by Harvard University, implying a need for race-blind admission processes. Fourthly, affirmative action can ironically perpetuate prejudice. It is sometimes perceived as 'reverse discrimination,' causing resentment and exacerbating divisions in society. Lastly, affirmative action can reduce quality by ignoring merit. As Clint Bolick of the Goldwater Institute pointed out, race-based affirmative action programs may overlook more qualified candidates, thereby perpetuating a fraud on the groups they aim to help. Considering these compelling reasons, we firmly advocate for the end of affirmative action."

","We stand against the motion to end mandatory retirement. We believe that mandatory retirement helps in creating opportunities for young workers, and it offers financial security to those approaching retirement. Our first argument is that mandatory retirement facilitates opportunities for younger employees. The International Labour Organization found that mandatory retirement encourages older workers to exit the workforce, creating room for the next generation. Secondly, mandatory retirement contributes to the financial security of retirees. The Employee Benefit Research Institute reported that mandatory retirement allows individuals to access pension and other benefits at a specified age, enhancing their financial stability in their post-work years. Considering these points, we argue that mandatory retirement serves to balance the workforce while providing assurance for those leaving it."

- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
","We wholeheartedly support the motion to end mandatory retirement. We hold that mandatory retirement erodes institutional knowledge, potentially harms the economy, exhibits age discrimination, reduces quality of life, and undermines the principle of retiring when ready. Firstly, we assert that mandatory retirement drains institutional knowledge. For instance, in the UK, there is no mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers, acknowledging the value of their accumulated experience. Secondly, mandatory retirement can negatively impact the economy. The World Economic Forum found that mandatory retirement impedes workforce diversity, thus limiting the range of skills and experiences available in the workplace. Thirdly, mandatory retirement could potentially result in age discrimination. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) reported that forcing older workers to retire irrespective of their ability contributes to ageist practices. Fourthly, mandatory retirement can lead to a decline in quality of life. Research from The American Economic Review suggests that health deteriorates post mandatory retirement, indicating reduced life quality. Lastly, we advocate for the principle of retiring when one is ready. The AARP supports this notion, asserting that active aging is fostered when people are allowed to retire on their own terms, contributing their skills and experiences for society's benefit. In light of these arguments, we firmly advocate for ending mandatory retirement."

    - Evidence 1: Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.

    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
","We oppose the motion to abolish nuclear weapons. Our stance is based on the premise that nuclear weapons play an essential role in protection and deterrence. Our argument revolves around the significant role of nuclear weapons in maintaining peace through deterrence. Deterrence is a strategy designed to discourage an entity from taking specific actions. This approach, largely enabled by nuclear weapons, has been pivotal in maintaining global peace for almost seven decades. To sum up, we argue that the abolition of nuclear weapons would disturb the existing balance of power and potentially jeopardize peace."
We should fight urbanization,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: MÄori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
","We vehemently support the motion to abolish nuclear weapons, based on the risks posed by such weapons falling into the wrong hands and the potential for provoking catastrophic military conflicts. Our first argument concerns the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands. Recent propaganda from ISIS has even suggested that they could acquire nuclear weapons within a year. This highlights the pressing need for global efforts to prevent such disastrous outcomes. Secondly, we assert that nuclear weapons can provoke or escalate disastrous military action. For instance, during the Cold War, had there been a Soviet nuclear attack, the U.S. would have launched over 3,200 nuclear weapons, resulting in estimated hundreds of millions of deaths and devastating fallout. Given these potential risks, we advocate for the abolition of nuclear weapons in order to safeguard humanity from such calamities."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
- claim_4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..
","We stand against the motion to fight urbanization, given the opportunities, economic benefits, and environmental advantages it provides. Firstly, cities offer more opportunities, acting as magnets for those seeking better lives, thereby fostering diversity and cultural exchange. Secondly, urbanization significantly benefits the economy. A prime example is China's shift towards privatization and urbanization, which led to an influx of international investment and significant economic development. Thirdly, urbanization can be beneficial for the environment. Urban environments drive innovation, including the development of green technologies that hold the promise for a more sustainable future. Considering these points, we believe that rather than fighting urbanization, we should work towards making it more sustainable and inclusive."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
","We stand firmly for the motion to combat urbanization. We believe it results in adverse socio-economic impacts, exacerbates crime rates, harms the environment, and overburdens city resources. Firstly, restrictions on migration could provide economic and social benefits to rural areas. As evidence, Venezuela's rural areas witnessed severe economic disinvestment and neglect following urbanization due to oil wealth discoveries, transforming it into a net food importer despite its fertile lands. Secondly, urbanization leads to a surge in crime rates. The social issues arising from urban migration, such as a rise in urban crime, poverty, and health problems, were evident in the experiences of Māori leaders and government policymakers. Thirdly, urbanization is harmful to the environment. The pollution of clean water supplies due to increasing urbanization is a prominent example. Lastly, urbanization places a massive strain on city resources. The UNESCO report highlighted the negative effects of overurbanization, including inadequate housing, absence of sanitary facilities, and limited access to educational facilities. In light of these reasons, we advocate for resisting the tide of urbanization to protect our rural areas, environment, and city resources."
We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
- claim_5: Legal cannabis will boost the black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Take California for example: first in the nation to legalize the medical use of the drug in 1996, the state would go on to legalize recreational use in 2016. But in just the past year, the state reported several massive illegal cannabis busts, with 20 tons of cannabis confiscated off a series of farms, $8 million worth of plants found in a thought-abandoned warehouse alongside a busy highway, and 100+ illegal operations busted in the southern town of Anza – just over the last three or four months..
","We oppose the notion of compulsory voting. Our stand is based on the freedom of expression, the right to abstain, and the potential for uninformed voting. Firstly, abstaining from voting is a way to express one's preferences. The choice to abstain may reflect ambivalence, mild disapproval, or even the fear of political repercussions. Secondly, citizens have the right not to vote. Compelling them to vote infringes upon their freedom of speech, as the right to speak includes the right to remain silent. Thirdly, compulsory voting may lead to uninformed or random voting. This susceptibility to sensational and misleading advertising might negatively affect campaigning techniques and undermine the democratic process. Lastly, not everyone has the capacity to vote, as evident from a poll showing a lack of basic knowledge about the constitution among Americans. For these reasons, we strongly argue against the imposition of compulsory voting."

- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant..
","We support the institution of compulsory voting. We believe that it enhances representation, fosters political interest, and fulfills civic duty. Firstly, compulsory voting increases representation. Low turnout in midterm elections, as indicated in the report by Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr., signals a need for measures to boost participation for better representation. Secondly, compulsory voting could spark more interest in politics among the population, leading to a more politically educated citizenry. Lastly, we argue that people have an obligation to vote. As per the European Court of Human Rights' ruling, mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, and voters have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot. In consideration of these points, we advocate for compulsory voting as a means to promote democracy, political education, and civic responsibility."
We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..
","The opposition staunchly contests the legalization of cannabis. Firstly, we point to health concerns, citing a study from the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore which found that heavy cannabis consumption altered blood proteins, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Secondly, we draw attention to the risk of impaired judgment and increased likelihood of accidents. Historical observations, such as those by Anslinger, demonstrate that cannabis usage can result in violent behaviour and irrational actions. Our third objection stems from the addictive nature of cannabis. We refer to evidence from the National Institute on Drug Abuse that shows the chemical THC, found in cannabis, triggers a release of dopamine in the brain. This reaction can create a cycle of repeated usage leading to addiction. Fourth, we express concern about underage access to cannabis if it is legalized. Former UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, expressed his worries about sending the wrong message to young, vulnerable teenagers, thereby increasing the risk of them gaining access to the drug. Lastly, we argue that the legalization of cannabis could inadvertently bolster illegal activities. As seen in California, despite legalizing the drug, there have been numerous massive illegal cannabis busts. Therefore, we firmly believe that the legalization of cannabis presents more harm than benefit."

- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
","The proposition passionately advocates for the legalization of cannabis. We first underline that legal substances like alcohol and tobacco are significantly more harmful than cannabis, citing the DAWN report which states that these substances are responsible for more than half a million deaths annually in the USA. Our second argument pertains to the economic benefits of legalizing cannabis. We refer to advocates who argue that removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act could save billions by reducing criminal justice system expenditures and could generate significant tax revenues. Third, we emphasize the potential health benefits of cannabis, noting that vaporizers used for cannabis consumption can deliver therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens. Fourth, we argue that regulation could be more effective with legalization. As shown by the British Crime Survey, the percentage of frequent users in the 16-24 age group fell significantly after the drug was downgraded to class C. Fifth, we contend that legalizing cannabis would decrease black market sales and trafficking, drawing from Law Enforcement Against Prohibition's argument that decriminalization would cut off financial gains earned by gangs. Lastly, we believe in individual autonomy, echoing philosopher John Stuart Mill's argument that individuals should have sovereignty over their own bodies and minds. In conclusion, the potential benefits of legalizing cannabis outweigh the perceived risks."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
","We stand firm in our opposition to the legalization of prostitution. Firstly, we believe legalization could lead to an increase in sexually transmitted diseases. A study conducted in Athens reported that a considerable number of prostitutes were HIV positive. Secondly, we fear that legalization could escalate immoral behaviour like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking. Reports from the Netherlands have shown an influx of these activities following the legalization of sex work. Thirdly, we are deeply concerned about the potential increase in violence against women. Critics of prostitution legalization in Sweden warned about the increase in violence and risk for women, and their concerns were realized after legalization. Lastly, we argue that selling one's body is inherently immoral, as prostitution places women in subordinate positions, reducing them to mere instruments for others' sexual pleasure. In conclusion, the harmful societal and personal consequences of legalizing prostitution far outweigh any potential benefits."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
","In support of the legalization of prostitution, we present the following compelling arguments: Firstly, we contend that legalizing sex work bolsters the economy. This is seen through the history of Seattle, where one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, asserted that well-regulated prostitution could functionally support the economy. Secondly, we argue that legalizing sex work increases the benefits for sex workers, like health care, safe sex, and unionization. Advocates of decriminalization insist that sex workers, like all individuals, deserve rights to safety, health, and human rights, and outdated criminal laws must be revised to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers. Our third argument emphasizes that legalizing sex work would allow for regulation and safer working conditions. For instance, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has suggested legalizing prostitution to acknowledge the existing illegal practices and provide safer, regulated, and revenue-generating sex. Fourth, we claim that legalizing sex work would make the profession safer for women. As seen in the Netherlands, tolerating formally illegal activities like prostitution for harm reduction has been successful in ensuring women's safety. Lastly, we affirm that sex work is a valid choice over one's body, supported by a 2009 study that found the normalization of sex work among the workers surveyed. In conclusion, we believe that legalizing prostitution would yield numerous benefits for individuals involved and society at large."

He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.

","We firmly oppose the legalization of sex selection due to the following reasons: Firstly, we warn that sex selection can lead to a gender imbalance, a concern substantiated by Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. He highlights the problematic gender ratios in countries like India and China due to sex selection practices. Secondly, we assert that sex selection reinforces gender stereotypes and biases. As seen in China, son preference persists in strictly traditional families and rural areas, particularly under the one-child policy. Our third argument is that sex selection can lead to abortions or infanticide. The enforcement of the one-child policy in China, coupled with the preference for sons, has resulted in the neglect of girls and, in some cases, female infanticide.

This is particularly applicable in countries like China, where the number of children per family is restricted, and gender selection can ensure the continuation of the family name. Our third argument is that sex selection can contribute to family happiness and completeness. As seen through adoption processes, families with a gender preference can legally select offspring of a specific sex, contributing to a sense of familial completeness. Fourth, we argue that sex selection can prevent certain diseases in children. For instance, gender selection can prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases by allowing the selection of a female embryo.

- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
","Opponents of prohibition argue, first and foremost, that flag burning is an effective tool of protest. To illustrate, they refer to an incident in 1984, when Gregory Lee Johnson set fire to an American flag during a protest against the Reagan administration. Despite being arrested and fined, the court ruled 5-4 in his favor, with Justice Brennan asserting that actions relating to the flag, such as saluting and displaying, are considered forms of expression, hence burning it must also be recognized as such. Secondly, they claim flag burning is justified under the freedom of expression. As further evidence, they cite Justice William Brennan's assertion in his majority opinion that defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..

Legislation is already in place in the EU to combat discrimination, including that based on sex, and supports positive action to empower women (Article 157 TFEU, Article 19 TFEU). Second, Women are an asset in combat. They cite historical examples from the Revolutionary War to the present, where women have demonstrated their value in combat, despite societal beliefs. Third, Women bring unique skills/strategies to the battlefield. Evidence shows that some women have demonstrated better leadership and innovative problem-solving abilities than some men, which enhances the overall combat unit. Fourth,Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat. An example is the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death in 1917, where they lead a successful offense against German trenches, demonstrating their combat efficacy. Fifth, Women should have the choice to serve in combat roles. They provide examples where women have already proven their capabilities in combat situations, and thus, should be officially credited and allowed to serve. Finally, Women should be accepted in combat roles as long as they pass the necessary tests. They reference the new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which are gender-free."

    - Evidence 1: Peace journalism, by presenting anomalous local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism, may help to expose these violent group's attempts to fix and naturalise meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence..
","The proponents for the prohibition of women in combat roles present the following arguments: First, Men are better suited to combat roles than women. They claim that biological differences in strength and fitness levels make men more capable in combat situations. Second, Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers. Evidence suggests that physical differences between men and women may hinder women's combat effectiveness. Third, Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. They argue that the presence of women on the front lines may distract men due to protective instincts. Fourth, Women should serve in safer roles. They cite data from the IDF indicating that women are more concentrated in combat-support roles. Finally, The capture of female soldiers is a concern. They believe that women may have less mental resilience and emotional control in tough situations, which could potentially compromise the performance of the military unit."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,gpt4,best_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
","While the free press is the bedrock of a democracy, subsidizing journalism comes with the risk of inserting bias and harming objectivity. Political endorsements, we've seen, can create perceived conflicts of interest, skewing the neutrality of reporting. Moreover, in our nation's early founding, we had one communication medium, newspapers. Today, we have an array of print, broadcast, and digital platforms. Federal subsidies could inadvertently decide winners and losers, shielding inefficient companies and presenting huge obstacles for burgeoning entrepreneurs. Finally, like any business, if journalism cannot sustain itself, it should fail. Just take a look at our recent past - the federal government bailed out banks and automobile manufacturers, straining the taxpayer's back. Can we really afford to add media companies to that list?"

    - Evidence 1: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
","The proposition argues that journalism, in today's world, is more than just a business. It is a crucial element of our democratic process. In this digital era, anyone can become a news distributor, making it difficult to sift through the massive amount of information online. A subsidy can provide a lifeline to professional journalistic entities amidst this competition. Furthermore, our history shows us the power of journalism in maintaining accountability and spreading information. Remember the Associated Press's factual reporting that quenched the public's thirst for news? Subsidizing journalism could potentially enhance the quality of reporting as well. Look at the IFJ's Ethical Journalism Initiative, a global campaign to defend standards in journalism. Moreover, subsidies can increase objectivity in reporting. For instance, consider 'Peace Journalism,' which presents local perspectives that often contradict the mainstream narrative. Such a nuanced approach can be supported with subsidies, giving voice to the unheard."

","We stand before you to argue against subsidizing space exploration. Private sector entities like SpaceX have shown us that commercial ventures can be successful. SpaceX not only delivers cargo and supplies to the ISS but also shuttles astronauts back and forth. Why then, do we need public funds? Moreover, space exploration is an expensive endeavour. With our current reliance on chemical propulsion, the costs of launching payloads into space are staggering. Do we want to pour public funds into something with such high overheads? Further, many space missions, including the shuttle and space station, have offered little scientific value. Lastly, we argue that there are more pressing issues to address right now, such as poverty. Thousands of children die each day due to poverty.

Summary of Arguments:

Claim 1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person who wants to commit it. Evidence is provided by the campaign group Dignity in Dying which advocates for a change in the law that would allow dying people to control their death, averting premature suicides abroad and the associated legal risks for those assisting.

Claim 2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering. This is supported by guidelines that declare euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide legal if a physician acts in accordance with due care, thus mitigating patient suffering.

Claim 3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life. The plaintiffs in Canada argue for the right of seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults to decide on a medically assisted death.

Claim 4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide. The claim is made on the grounds of personal autonomy and quality of life, with the view that death can be a preferable alternative when the patient's pain or suffering cannot otherwise be relieved."

Summary of Arguments:

Claim 1: Assisted suicide enables manipulation of vulnerable individuals for others' benefit. This concern is articulated in the stipulation that the patient must be in an irreparable medical condition with a long-term history with the doctor.

Claim 2: Assisted suicide should not be permitted as patients can improve. This argument points to the fact that depression, burden and dependency fears could be signs that not every effort has yet been made to improve a patient's condition.

Claim 3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role as a healer. This ethical argument is voiced by Dr. Lynda Young, MD, who insists that the act is fundamentally incompatible with a physician's role.

Claim 4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others. The New Zealand Medical Association argues that voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide are unethical, regardless of patient or family wishes.

    - Evidence 1: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..

You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
","Debate Topic 1: Homeschooling should be banned

Stance: For

Argument (Claim 1): Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.

Evidence: There are considerable child safety risks linked to the lack of regulation in homeschooling environments. Public schools serve as a vital social safety net, detecting potential child abuse cases and ensuring necessary health requirements like vaccination are met. The absence of such regulation in homeschools might lead to the neglect of these critical aspects.
Argument (Claim 2): Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.

Evidence: According to Professor Elizabeth Bartholet from Harvard Law School, mainstream schooling provides exposure to community values, social values, democratic values, non-discrimination and tolerance of other people's viewpoints. Such exposures are crucial for a child's social development, which homeschooling might limit.
Argument (Claim 3): Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.

Evidence: Public school teachers are required to have education degrees and usually possess considerable teaching experience, thereby potentially offering higher educational quality. Many parents, on the other hand, struggle with the dual role of parenting and teaching.
Argument (Claim 4): Parents are not qualified as teachers.

Evidence: By homeschooling, parents are expected to deliver the entire range of learning that a child needs, from hiring tutors, checking their background, to preparing the child for exams and taking them to external examination centers. This demands a significant amount of effort and knowledge, which not all parents can meet."

We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.

","II. Topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government' - Positive Stance

Supporters of government regulation of social media platforms argue:

Regulation protects young audiences. They cite a statement by Norman Lamb emphasizing the government's role in protecting young people online.
Regulation helps combat fake news, highlighting the prevalence of fake content during the presidential campaign circulated by Russian sources on Facebook and Twitter.
Regulation benefits society overall. This is backed by OfcomÕs Chief Executive, Dame Melanie Dawes, who acknowledges the need for balanced rules that protect users and ensure free expression.
Regulation can mitigate negative content. Evidence includes Pierre DeBois's argument for close attention to social media platforms' real-world impacts, like disinformation or hate speech.
Regulation is essential to counter malicious users, backed by a survey that found millions of online social network accounts had been accessed without authorization in 2011."

Critics of living in the US assert:

The country's health and education policies are unfair, underlined by the number of uninsured children in poverty and Hispanic children in 2007.
The political system is problematic and divisive, with a study suggesting that American polarization is 'especially multifaceted'.
The country's culture has negative aspects. A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association implies that living in America could be as risky as unhealthy lifestyle choices.
High taxation and living costs exist. A survey by TD Ameritrade highlighted cost of living as the most significant threat to financial security for nearly half of Americans.
The country has high levels of inequality and poverty, as reflected by the U.S. Gini coefficient, which is significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany.
The country is unsafe, evidenced by a marked drop in respondents considering the U.S. safe in a quality of life survey.
The U.S. is seen as xenophobic/racist, supported by evidence of racial discrimination in the labor market, where 'white-sounding' names are preferred over 'black-sounding' names."

- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..

    - Evidence 1: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons...

- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..

Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse.

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
","Debate Summary:

Topic: 'We should abandon marriage.'
Supporter's stance:
a. Claim: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
- Evidence: Evidence suggests that women may suffer more negative effects from bad marriages than men, which may explain why a majority of divorce initiations come from women.
b. Claim: Marriages are unstable.
- Evidence: Historical data shows that nearly half of marriages in the 1970s in the US ended in divorce within 25 years.
c. Claim: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
- Evidence: Some laws governing marital relations inherently favor one party over the other, potentially causing inequality and unfair treatment.

Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..

Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..

People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.

The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases.

Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
","Topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment'

Stance: Positive supporters' arguments

Claim 1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.

Evidence: The application of the death penalty in the US has been shown to be dependent on the individual's financial status, the skill of their attorneys, the race of the victim, and where the crime took place. This makes the system fundamentally unfair and unjust.
Claim 2: The death penalty disproportionately affects the disenfranchised.

Evidence: A 2010 study found that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case, illustrating that the death penalty diverts resources that could be used for public safety, health, and welfare.
Claim 3: The death penalty is irreversible.

Evidence: H. Lee Sarokin, a former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, argues that deterrence plays no significant role in reducing crime. He points out that the irreversible nature of the death penalty outweighs its limited potential deterrent effect."

Research conducted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the United Nations University indicated a positive correlation between a robust IP system and subsequent economic growth across six Asian countries.
Intellectual property rights safeguard against theft. Proponents state that copyright, in particular, helps preserve intellectual property in sectors such as films, music, and television.

Intellectual property rights may hamper the continuous improvement of a product or service. Critics, such as those from the free culture movement, argue that intellectual monopolies harm health, obstruct progress, and primarily benefit concentrated interests, hurting public interest.
Intellectual property rights can limit access to crucial information or products.

Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%.

Opponents' Stance:

Atheism discriminates against religious people and violates freedom of religion. The Albanian Constitution of 1976 provides an example of state-promoted atheism that stifles religious freedoms, demonstrating how such policies can infringe on individuals' rights to their beliefs.

Atheism lacks a moral grounding. As per the theologian Douglas Wilson, while atheists can behave morally, the absence of belief hinders their ability to rationally account for why they should lead a morally responsible life.

People should have the right to choose whether or not to adopt atheism. Freedom of religion or belief, protected by laws in democratic societies, enables individuals to decide their spiritual path based on their personal convictions, not under the influence of imposed atheistic ideologies."

","DEBATE SUMMARY

TOPIC: We should adopt atheism.

Supporters' Stance:

Atheism offers personal benefits. By discarding the dogmatic rules and controversial beliefs presented in religious texts, atheists can lead lives free of doctrinal confusion and fear-driven practices.

Atheism is a rational response to the absence of evidence for God's existence. As per the atheist Michael Scriven, lack of evidence for God's existence necessitates atheism.

Some religions teach immoral practices. There are examples of religious doctrines advocating harmful behaviors, such as the biblical guidance on slave treatment, which some argue are immoral and thus a reason to eschew religion.

Science offers sufficient explanation for the universe. Renowned physicist Stephen Weinberg posits that religion is a 'nightmare', and scientific advancements can adequately explain the nature of the universe."

Libertarianism can result in unequal outcomes. Economists like Joseph Stiglitz argue that market failures can produce disparities, necessitating government intervention.

Libertarianism could lead to the removal of essential laws, infrastructure, and government services. Critics, particularly environmentalists, contend that libertarian rejection of regulations may hinder collective efforts to tackle issues like environmental degradation.

","Debate Script

[Libertarianism Topic]

Affirmative Case:

I. Introduction

Our first argument today is in favor of the adoption of libertarianism. Libertarianism, at its core, values the freedom and autonomy of individuals, and we will discuss why these values are conducive to a healthy, prosperous society.

II. Argument

A. Libertarianism and Economic Growth

As our first argument, we assert that libertarianism stimulates economic growth. This is backed by numerous organizations such as Americans for Limited Government, who argue that reduced taxation leads to financial freedom and economic prosperity.

B. Freedom in the Political System

Our second argument lies in the political sphere. Libertarianism ensures the protection of property rights, which is a fundamental aspect of individual freedom. Renowned economist James Buchanan argues that these rights are a cornerstone of a just and free society.

C. Fulfilment and Happiness

As our third point, we argue that libertarianism can increase happiness and fulfilment in society. Sociologist Robert Putnam supports this by explaining that libertarianism's promotion of free association fosters cooperation and understanding, which are crucial to societal wellbeing.

D. Individual Liberties

Our final argument highlights the core principle of libertarianism - individual liberties. Libertarian philosopher Murray Rothbard asserts that self-ownership, a key component of libertarianism, is the only universal ethic that is applicable regardless of place or time, ensuring the preservation of individual rights."

","[Human Cloning Topic]

Negative Case:

I. Introduction

We argue against the banning of human cloning, a technology that holds tremendous potential for scientific advancement and human welfare.

II. Argument

A. Cloning for Medical Research

Firstly, cloning is instrumental in the progression of medical research. The Journal of the American Medical Association states that cloning can enhance our understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's, and aid in the development of new treatments.

B. Cloning for Child Creation

Secondly, cloning offers hope for those who cannot otherwise have a child. The New England Journal of Medicine found that cloning can reduce the transmission of genetic diseases.

C. Cloning for Health Promotion

Thirdly, cloning can contribute to general health promotion. For instance, cloning can aid in the study of genetic factors of infertility and provide potential therapies, according to a study in the Fertility and Sterility journal.

D. Cloning for Scientific Research

Lastly, cloning aids in furthering scientific research. The Journal of Evolutionary Biology mentions that cloning can aid in studying extinct species and further our understanding of evolution."

Affirmative Case:

I. Introduction

We advocate for the ban on human cloning based on ethical, religious, and safety concerns.

II. Argument

A. Misunderstood Nature of Cloning

First, we assert that cloning is insufficiently understood. As Kass writes, a society that tolerates cloning has tacitly agreed to converting procreation into manufacture.

B. Unethical and Anti-religious Practices

Second, cloning has been widely criticized as unethical and anti-religious. The Holy See, backed by several nations, expressed concern over cloning legitimizing the creation of humans for research purposes.

C. Unnatural Practice

Third, cloning disrupts natural processes. According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order by removing the conventional reproductive process from the marital relationship.

D. Safety Concerns

Finally, the safety of cloning is a grave concern. The Council of Europe's 2008 report warns about potential abuse of cloning technology and recommends usage only for medical purposes."

","Debate Summary 1: ""We should ban private military companies""

The Opponent's Argument:

The opposition stance against banning private military companies presents four key arguments. Firstly, they argue the financial benefits of hiring these companies, backed by a 2010 study from International Affairs that demonstrates their role in reducing bureaucratic processes and streamlining decision-making.

Secondly, a 2007 Senate Armed Services Committee report evidences their claim of these companies' superior training and equipment, highlighting their capacity to respond quickly in crisis situations.

Thirdly, they propose that private military companies can supplement regular armies in tasks which are not suitable or desirable for the regular forces. The RAND Corporation's 2013 report cites offloading of non-core tasks like security and support to these companies, thereby freeing up army personnel for their primary mission.

Lastly, the opposition argues these companies improve safety, drawing on a 2010 Heritage Foundation report that points out their role in support services, hence enabling regular forces to concentrate on more critical tasks."

The Proponent's Argument:

Advocates for the ban of private military companies argue that these entities exhibit unethical behaviors and can commit crimes. The Congressional Research Service's 2010 report substantiates their point with instances of unlawful killings by these companies.

They also claim that these companies lack professionalism, underpinned by a 2009 Amnesty International report, which accuses these entities of hiring poorly trained personnel.

Further, they argue these companies' loyalty to the hiring country is questionable due to their inherent lack of transparency, as highlighted by a 2007 Human Rights Watch report.

The proponents also contend these companies prioritize profit, with a 2006 International Peace Institute report warning about the largely unregulated nature of the private military industry.

Finally, they argue these companies can even incite conflict, using a 2009 Congressional Research Service report to underscore the lack of accountability that can escalate conflicts."

The Opponent's Argument:

Opponents to the ban on child actors hold that acting could be a child's dream, citing a 2010 report by the American Psychological Association, which suggests that acting can be an avenue for children to express their emotions and may inspire them to pursue a career in the arts.

They also argue that child performers can attain success and build confidence, offering the example of Ashwin Chitale winning the best child artist award.

They contend that child actors are vital for certain roles, with a 2014 Actors Equity Association report demonstrating that children in specific roles enhance audience engagement and broaden appeal.

Opponents believe that child performers should be permitted to work provided there is adequate supervision and regulation, as shown in a real-life example where a production had to adhere to child labor laws.

Lastly, they argue that parents should have the right to make decisions for their children, supported by a 2018 American Academy of Pediatrics report that underscores legal protections for parents' decision-making rights."

They stated that even Asian students, a group often deemed high-achieving, gained from this diversity.

It compensates for historical injustice: As noted by historian Roger Wilkins, African Americans have suffered from 345 years of oppression in North America, including slavery and legalized discrimination. Comparing their social mobility with immigrant groups who often arrive with professional qualifications is denying this historical reality.

","DEBATE SCRIPT

TITLE: Ending Mandatory Retirement: A Step Towards Equity, Flexibility, and Quality of Life

Ladies and Gentlemen, today we stand in support of ending mandatory retirement, a move we believe will enhance institutional knowledge, contribute to the economy, promote fairness, improve quality of life, and allow individuals to retire when ready.

Firstly, consider the valuable knowledge that experienced employees bring to any institution. An exemplar of this is the U.S. commercial airline industry. Pilots, constrained by a mandatory retirement age of 65, must leave their roles, despite their wealth of expertise and wisdom. The arbitrary cessation of their careers deprives their organizations of this irreplaceable institutional knowledge.

Secondly, mandatory retirement has a detrimental impact on the economy. A 2019 study by the International Monetary Fund revealed that compulsory retirement ages can limit labor market flexibility, subsequently constraining the ability of employers to react to changing economic conditions.

Furthermore, let us address the question of fairness. According to a 2016 study by the World Economic Forum, compulsory retirement can create intergenerational inequity and limit diversity within the workplace. This deprivation of diverse experiences and skills restricts opportunities for intergenerational collaboration.

Moreover, the toll on quality of life must not be overlooked. As per research published in The Gerontologist, mandatory retirement can lead to diminished social connections and increased feelings of loneliness, negatively impacting retirees' overall wellbeing.

Finally, retirement should be a personal choice. The World Economic Forum's 2016 study showed that enabling individuals to retire when ready could potentially reduce poverty rates among the elderly, by allowing continued income and lessening dependence on social benefits."

It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
","Debate Topic: ""We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons""

Supporters' Arguments:

Argument 1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.

Evidence: Research Fellow in Nuclear Security and Arms Control Law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, Jonathan Herbach, argues that the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which have never been recovered, is a significant cause for concern. He points out that these materials continue to persist and that more states are expressing interest in their development. The risk of nuclear weapons or materials ending up in the wrong hands, such as terrorist organizations, could lead to disastrous consequences.

Argument 2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.

Evidence: Referencing the Cuban missile crisis, Anthony Aguirre argues that tensions become significantly more probable to escalate into major issues when nuclear weapons are involved. He suggests that the international community was very fortunate to successfully navigate the Cuban Missile Crisis, and it would be overconfident to believe that we would survive a similar escalation in the future. Therefore, nuclear weapons, instead of ensuring peace, might instead provoke or escalate a disastrous military action."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,gpt4,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
","First Argument: Opposition to Fighting Urbanization
The opponents of the fight against urbanization suggest three primary arguments:

Cities offer more opportunities: As substantiated by Japan's economic development in the mid-twentieth century, urbanization catalyzed increased migration from rural areas, enhancing opportunities for improved jobs and education.
Urbanization benefits the economy: Urbanization promotes economic growth. Even in cases of overurbanization, the benefits such as efficient economies of scale, diversity in occupations and products, and increased adaptability and mobility are apparent.
Urbanization benefits the environment: Cities drive innovation, including green technologies, suggesting urbanization could potentially propel the development of the green economy in the future."

- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..
- claim_2: Urbanization causes crime.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: What is certain is that the crime rate certainly rose during the period of industrialisation, particularly in towns and cities..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Surveys showed that urbanization and coastal development, especially from tourism and agricultural sectors, contributed to increased degradation of the marine environment in the area..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and good-quality touristic services, so the fast process of urbanization, had the consequence of irregular neighbourhoods..
","Second Argument: Support for Fighting Urbanization
On the other hand, advocates for the fight against urbanization propose four main arguments:

Restrictions on migration benefit rural areas: As shown in India, protecting natural resources diminished incentives for rural to urban migration, enhancing the livelihoods of rural residents.
Urbanization incites crime: The rising crime rate during the industrialization period, particularly in urban areas, establishes a direct correlation between urbanization and crime.
Urbanization harms the environment: The degradation of marine environments due to urbanization and coastal development is a testament to the environmental harm caused by rapid urban expansion.
Urbanization strains city resources: The swift pace of urbanization often leads to unregulated neighborhoods, straining the resources of the city, as evidenced in many regions with rapid commercial and touristic growth."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,gpt4,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.

- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
- claim_4: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..
","Third Argument: Opposition to Compulsory Voting
Those opposing compulsory voting forward several arguments:

Abstaining reflects preferences: According to Herbert Spencer, abstaining from voting is a form of consent to the rule of the winning candidate, highlighting that non-voting also represents personal preferences.
Citizens have a right not to vote: As reflected in the views of Minchin, a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, compulsory voting is considered a fundamental breach of civil liberties.
Compulsory voting can lead to uninformed or random voting: Under compulsory systems, uninformed individuals may cast random votes, skewing election results and failing to increase civic engagement.
Not everyone has the ability to vote: With the lack of basic political knowledge prevalent among citizens, compulsory voting may lead to misinformed voting, adversely impacting the election outcome."

Claim: Compulsory voting increases representation.
Evidence: Supporters argue that mandatory voting ensures candidates cater to the needs of all voters, preventing the system from skewing toward the well-off and well-educated. They use the United States as an example where voluntary voting leads to less representation from poorer and less educated individuals.

Claim: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.

The opposition suggests that legalizing sex work could escalate violence against women. Evidence for this argument comes from Giobbe's (1993) research, which highlighted similarities in the behavior of pimps and batterers, including enforced social isolation, threats, intimidation, verbal and sexual abuse.

","Debate Summary

Topic: We should legalize sex selection

For supporters:

Claim: Parents should have the freedom to select the sex of the child.
Evidence: By knowing the sex of the baby in advance, parents can plan for their family appropriately. They will be able to ensure a quality education and proper nutrition for their child.

Claim: Sex selection aids in better family planning.
Evidence: Sex selection allows parents to effectively control the number of children they have. In places with restrictive child policies, like China, sex selection can ensure a preferred gender, such as a male child to carry on the family name.

Claim: Sex selection contributes to a happier, more complete family.
Evidence: If parents desire a child of a particular gender, they may feel more affectionate towards the child. For example, a family with four boys who desire a girl can choose the gender of their next child, potentially increasing family happiness.

Claim: Sex selection can prevent diseases in the child.
Evidence: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) can be used to select embryos without genetic disorders, reducing chances of disease and increasing the possibility of successful pregnancy.

Claim: Sex selection can prevent abortions or infanticide.
Evidence: In societies with a preference for a specific gender, allowing for sex selection can prevent the horrific practice of gender-based infanticide or abortions."

    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
","Opposition to the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat'

Argument 1: There should be equality between men and women. This claim is supported by the fact that women have been closing the gap with men in various aspects of society such as health and labor participation, making them equally suitable for combat roles.

Argument 2: Women are an asset in combat. This is substantiated by the shift in modern warfare that increasingly relies on technology rather than physical strength, allowing women with combat skills to effectively engage with the enemy.

Argument 3: Women can create unique skills/strategies. This is demonstrated by historical instances like the Soviet Army during the Second World War, where women snipers made significant contributions on the front lines, regardless of their physical strength.

Argument 4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat. This is highlighted by the case of the 1st Russian WomenÕs Battalion of Death in 1917, which played a vital role in an offensive against German trenches.

Argument 5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to. Evidence shows that women can often be more effective in delicate and sensitive roles, which enriches the talent pool of the military.

Argument 6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests. The belief is that if women can meet the same training standards as men, they could be an invaluable addition to their units."

Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
","Supporters for the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat'

Argument 1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women. This argument is supported by the physical differences that may hinder women in combat units.

Argument 2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers. This is backed by data from the US Army, showing a significant difference in test results between men and women.

Argument 3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. This argument is supported by concerns raised by the Ministry of Defence about the potential consequences of mixed-gender combat teams.

Argument 4: Women should serve in safer roles. This argument is based on data from the IDF, which shows a minimal percentage of women in combat positions.

Argument 5: Women soldier capture is a big concern. This claim is reinforced by arguments regarding women's resilience, resistance to fatigue and emotional control under stress."

- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..
- claim_4: Subsidy increases objectivity in reporting.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Peace journalism, by presenting anomalous local perspectives which contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism, may help to expose these violent group's attempts to fix and naturalise meaning and to take advantage of this meaning to promote their violence..
","[Subsidizing Journalism - Affirmative Stance]
Firstly, the argument for subsidizing journalism asserts:

The financial viability of journalism relies on subsidies. The COVID-19 pandemic left many news media organizations without a significant chunk of their advertising revenues. State subsidies helped bridge this gap, ensuring these media outlets could continue their operations.

Journalism plays a vital role in disseminating information and enforcing accountability. According to a 2011 report from the Oxford School for the Study of Journalism and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, mainstream media is integral to fostering topical social media conversations in the UK.

Providing subsidies can enhance the quality of journalism. For instance, the European Union believes subsidies can promote competition between new entrants and incumbents in the media sector, which fosters diverse ideas, encourages debates, and supports democratic decision-making, especially amidst the fake news era.

Subsidies can foster objectivity in reporting. By promoting peace journalism, which contrasts with the violence-promoting war journalism, subsidies help expose groups that seek to exploit media narratives for their violent agendas."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,gpt4,best_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:

- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..
","[Subsidizing Space Exploration - Negative Stance]
On the other hand, the argument against subsidizing space exploration states:

Private companies can take on the role of space exploration. NASA's partnerships with private companies like Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX are recent examples of this privatization.

Space exploration is a costly endeavor. The expenses associated with space exploration run into billions, and critics argue that advancements in technology can occur even without these costs.

Space exploration is deemed ineffective due to its environmental impact. For instance, the SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch, contributing significantly to pollution.

Funds used for space exploration could be better utilized elsewhere. With NASA's $19.3 billion annual budget, we could cover the cost of public university education for 1.94 million young adults, or provide healthcare for 1.87 million people."

Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..

On the flip side, proponents of subsidizing space exploration argue:

Space exploration allows us to potentially colonize and utilize the resources of other planets, which is a decision that must be reached through a broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense, and international parties.

Space exploration can fuel advancements in science and technology. After GagarinÕs 1961 flight, human crewed missions carried out a wide array of significant research, from geologic investigations on the Moon to various observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft.

Space exploration is financially rewarding. Morgan Stanley suggests that by 2040, satellite broadband, a product of space exploration, will account for 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy.

Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity. Advancements made in sustainable technology for off-world colonies could serve as models to preserve EarthÕs wellbeing.

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience..
","The topic under debate is whether we should subsidize vocational education.

The opponents of this idea put forth four main arguments:

The first claim is that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes. They base their argument on a 2019 report by the American Federation of Teachers, which found that subsidizing vocational education might not necessarily have extensive benefits for the economy, as many such programs may not equip workers with the skills required to thrive in the 21st century.

Their second claim asserts that subsidizing vocational education is costly. This argument is backed by a 2020 study from the National Center for Postsecondary Research, which found that the scalability of subsidized vocational education programs could be limited due to a lack of resources and infrastructure to cater to a large number of students.

Thirdly, the opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions. They cite a study examining the impact of subsidies for vocational education in Germany, which discovered that such subsidies led to increased enrollment in vocational programs and decreased enrollment in academic programs, suggesting that subsidies can influence student choice and lead to an overabundance in those fields.

Lastly, they claim that vocational education is not a good career choice. This view is backed by a 2019 American Federation of Teachers report that many vocational education programs do not offer advancement opportunities, making it challenging for workers to progress in their careers, regardless of their skills and experience."

","The topic under debate is whether we should subsidize vocational education.

On the other hand, proponents of subsidizing vocational education advance four main arguments:

They first claim that subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources. A 2020 study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research supports this, showing that subsidizing vocational education can enhance economic mobility, particularly for individuals who may not have access to traditional forms of postsecondary education or who face barriers to employment.

Secondly, supporters argue that vocational education better suits many students. A 2019 report by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium shows that vocational education programs often offer learning experiences tailored to the individual needs and interests of students, which can better suit the learning styles of many students compared to traditional academic programs.

Thirdly, they argue that vocational education is a good career choice. A 2020 report by the National Skills Coalition supports this by showing that individuals with vocational education often have a shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional four-year degrees, as vocational programs provide practical, hands-on training and education.

Lastly, they contend that vocational education benefits the entire market and society. This argument is backed by a 2019 study from the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, which found that vocational education programs can promote workforce diversity by providing training and education in in-demand fields, which in turn can increase the representation of diverse individuals in the workforce, benefiting the entire market and society."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 2: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
    - Evidence 2: In 2002, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide. This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
    - Evidence 2: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
","Opponents argue that assisted suicide gives dignity to the person who chooses it. They substantiate this claim with the prevalence of the term dignity in organizations and laws advocating for assisted suicide, such as Dignitas in Europe and the American Death with Dignity Acts. Furthermore, campaigns like Dignity in Dying advocate for law changes to allow terminally ill, mentally competent adults to opt for an assisted death within strict rules and safeguards. Secondly, opponents assert that assisted suicide reduces suffering. They present evidence of certain regions where euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if certain criteria are met, which include the patient's unbearable and hopeless suffering and the absence of reasonable alternatives. Moreover, studies show that just having the option for assisted suicide brings peace of mind to patients and reduces their suffering. Thirdly, they argue that people should have the freedom to choose to end their lives. This is backed by the practice of physician-assisted suicide (PAD) wherein a competent, suffering patient requests the means to end their life. They also reference the Netherlands, where euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide have been legalized since 2002, demonstrating the exercise of this freedom. Lastly, they argue that the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide, citing instances of individuals like Pratchett who wished to die by assisted suicide before their diseases reached a critical point. Additionally, they point to the experiences of countries where euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are permitted, suggesting that these practices may be acceptable in certain situations."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text..
    - Evidence 2: The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient..
- claim_2: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: In 1997, in the cases of Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it..
- claim_3: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
    - Evidence 2: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
","Proponents contend that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role. They back this claim with instances where organizations have warned against doctors becoming agents of a patient's death, and laws like in New York that criminalize physician-assisted suicide. Secondly, they argue that people do not have the right to self-harm or harm others. They substantiate this by referencing Supreme Court rulings that upheld the prohibition of assisted suicide as it is not a fundamental liberty interest protected under the Constitution. Thirdly, they maintain that people who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help, suggesting the potential for a 'slippery slope' if assisted suicide or euthanasia is permitted. They reference critiques of the Netherlands' practices, indicating the potential for non-voluntary euthanasia of vulnerable groups if the current restrictions are loosened."

    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.
    - Evidence 2: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
- claim_5: The home is a good learning environment.

    - Evidence 1: Theywant to see their children enjoy a broader socialization than a typical classroom allows and to give theirchildren “a more active learning environment, with provision of real opportunities to structure their owndays.
    - Evidence 2: Unschoolers cite studies which report that home educated students tend to be more mature than their schooled peers, and some believe this is a result of the wide range of people with which they have the opportunity to communicate..
","They argue that homeschooling is often the best option for exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students. This is substantiated with the services provided by agencies like Eastern York Schools to district home-schooled students and examples of families choosing homeschooling due to unique circumstances, like living in isolated rural locations or traveling extensively. Secondly, they posit that homeschooling can be personalized to the child's pace and needs. They cite examples of successful individuals like Gosling, who credit homeschooling for their sense of autonomy. Furthermore, homeschooling allows for an adaptable education based on the child's interests, abilities, and learning style, leading to increased engagement and personal development. Thirdly, they argue against mainstream schools due to the prevalent violence and bullying. They support this claim by citing the motive of homeschoolers to protect their children from violence, drugs, and psychological abuse in traditional schools. Fourthly, they maintain that parents should be allowed to choose their children's education. They back this with examples of parents wanting a deeper understanding"
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 2: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 2: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 2: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
","The advocates of banning homeschooling present compelling arguments. They argue that homeschooling lacks standardization and regulation, citing Vyckie Garrison's account of homeschooling her children amidst life-threatening pregnancies and limited regulation in Nebraska. They argue that without sufficient regulation, homeschooling can potentially allow instances of child abuse to go unnoticed and essential services, such as adequate nutrition and vaccinations, provided by public schools to be missed. Further, they stress the importance of mainstream schools in developing social skills. They highlight that homeschooled children often miss out on experiences like work experience opportunities, sports leagues, and recognition and reward systems. They quote Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet who underscores the importance of community values, social values, democratic values, and tolerance, which children can gain from mainstream schools. The proponents also question the educational quality of homeschooling. They cite the National Education Association's opposition to homeschooling and the European Court of Human Rights upholding a German ban on homeschooling, stating that the right to education calls for regulation by the state. Lastly, they question parents' qualifications to teach, warning of the potential for a one-sided point of view and the immense responsibility of meeting all of a child's educational needs. They cite Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich who wrote about the potential dangers of homeschooling in terms of limiting children's exposure to diverse viewpoints."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations, or their side effects, are dangerous.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus (RV), was pulled from the market by the manufacturer nine months after it was introduced after it was discovered that the vaccine might have contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction)..
    - Evidence 2: The CDC reports that pneumonia can be caused by the chickenpox vaccine, and a “small possibility” exists that the flu vaccine could be associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a disorder in which the person’s immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system, in about one or two per million people vaccinated..
- claim_2: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The First Amendment of the US Constitution states, 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'.
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity, which is a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as in the European Convention on Human Rights..
","Opponents of mandatory child vaccinations argue about the potential dangers and side effects of these vaccines. They point to examples such as the Rotashield, a vaccine for rotavirus, that was withdrawn from the market due to its potential contribution to bowel obstruction. They also mention that the CDC acknowledges a link between the chickenpox vaccine and pneumonia, and a small possibility exists that the flu vaccine could lead to Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Further, they argue that mandatory vaccination infringes on basic rights, citing the First Amendment of the US Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They contend that mandatory vaccination is an interference with the human right of bodily integrity and private life."
Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Routine child vaccinations are effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
    - Evidence 2: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 2: The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that vaccination prevents 3.5–5 million deaths per year, and up to 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination.
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..
- claim_4: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 2: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
    - Evidence 2: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
","Supporters of mandatory child vaccinations argue that these vaccines are effective. They provide evidence such as the substantial decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and the dramatic reduction in polio cases worldwide, thanks to vaccination programs. They stress that child vaccinations save lives, referring to an estimate that full vaccination of all US children born in a year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections. They also cite the World Health Organization (WHO), which estimates that vaccination prevents millions of deaths per year. Moreover, supporters emphasize the necessity of routine child vaccinations to protect others. They cite instances such as a measles outbreak in the U.S. in 2005 due to an unvaccinated teenager and a 2012 outbreak of pertussis due to low herd immunity in 49 US states. They assert that mandatory vaccinations are crucial to prevent virus/disease spreading, citing the eradication of deadly diseases like smallpox and the efficacy of vaccines like the pertussis vaccine. Finally, they argue that children should not have to suffer from preventable diseases. They reference the fact that vaccine-preventable diseases cause millions of childhood deaths each year and that vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths, to the extent that the World Health Organization characterizes it as one of the top ten global health threats."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Social media regulation is not effective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
    - Evidence 2: The groups wrote that, 'The FTC’s failure to enforce its order has resulted in the unlawful transfer of [87] million user records … [i]t is unconscionable that the FTC allowed this unprecedented disclosure of Americans’ personal data to occur. The FTC’s failure to act imperils not only privacy but democracy as well.'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most also feel they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center that explores how Americans feel about the state of privacy in the nation..
    - Evidence 2: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..
- claim_3: Social media regulation harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Reuters reported last year that Facebook had committed to restrict significantly more Vietnamese content after Vietnam passed a cybersecurity law in 2018, and Amnesty International documented some of the impact on activists and journalists. CPJ noted that the law’s vague prohibitions on posts that would offend leaders, distort history, or cause confusion were a clear threat to press freedom..
    - Evidence 2: For Peggy Hicks, Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights, nearly every country that has adopted laws relating to online content has jeopardised human rights in doing so..
- claim_4: The government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: When governments spend on public goods and merit goods, they may create excess bureaucracy and inefficiency..
    - Evidence 2: In the U.S., debate grew heated regarding government intervention in the market system, as intervention can cause disruptions, including extending a recession or depression, as the market has a tendency to adjust naturally equalising inadequacies..
- claim_5: Social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
    - Evidence 2: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..
","The opponents of the topic argue that government regulation of social media platforms is ineffective, detrimental to privacy, inhibits freedom of speech, and potentially leads to political abuses. They underline that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), enacted in 2018, failed to effectively discipline prominent platforms like Facebook and Google regarding their data-collection practices. Citing the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) inability to prevent unlawful data transfer of 87 million user records, they question the efficacy of such regulations. Additionally, they believe these regulations compromise user privacy, referencing a Pew Research Center survey where a majority of respondents felt their personal information was out of their control and at risk. They argue that such regulation suppresses freedom of speech and could jeopardize democratic rights, as evidenced by Vietnam's cybersecurity law and its negative impact on activists and journalists. They further caution against government intervention in private entities, citing potential inefficiencies and disruptions. Lastly, they warn of potential political abuse, pointing out instances of misleading political advertisements."

- claim_1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
    - Evidence 2: The European Union reached a deal on Saturday on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation..
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 2: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 2: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
","The proponents of the topic argue that government regulation of social media platforms is crucial for protecting younger audiences, combating fake news, benefiting society at large, dealing with negative content, and managing malicious users. They stress the importance of statutory regulators to safeguard young users from harmful content, highlighted by the tragic case of Molly Russell, a British teenager exposed to distressing content on Instagram. They underline the need for regulation to combat misinformation, noting a widespread belief in the public that major news organizations frequently produce false information. They emphasize the societal benefits of such regulation, referencing potential legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union aimed at enhancing transparency and combating manipulative techniques. They stress the role of regulation in managing negative content, such as hate speech and terrorist propaganda. Finally, they cite the need for regulation to prevent unauthorized access to accounts, which affected 60 million cases in 2011."

    - Evidence 2: In another study, it was found that white teachers were more likely to give constructive feedback on essays if they believed the student who wrote it was white. Essays perceived to be written by Black or Latino students were given more praise and less guidance on how to improve their writing..
- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
    - Evidence 2: The 2020 presidential election further highlighted these deep-seated divides. Supporters of Biden and Donald Trump believe the differences between them are about more than just politics and policies..
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
    - Evidence 2: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
    - Evidence 2: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..
    - Evidence 2: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..

    - Evidence 2: A range of scholars from at least the late 19th century to the present have produced arguments that white supremacy exists in U.S. school curriculum, oftentimes to the detriment of non-White students Americans' learning outcomes and the whole of American society..
","The opponents of the topic argue that the US has unfair health and education policies, a problematic political system, a negative culture, high living costs, high inequality levels, safety issues, and is xenophobic or racist. They assert that the healthcare system is disproportionately unaffordable for Black and Hispanic adults, and that racial bias persists in education. They contend that the political system is divisive, as revealed by the 2020 presidential election. They criticize the culture for being disrespectful and self-centered. They bemoan the high taxation and living costs, especially in cities like Manhattan where middle-income families struggle to make ends meet. They highlight the stark wealth disparity, with the top 10% of Americans owning nearly 70% of the wealth, and the persisting homelessness problem. They express concerns about safety due to the high fear of violent crime among the public. Lastly, they mention instances of racism and xenophobia, citing hate crimes against Asian Americans and arguments of white supremacy in school curriculum."

","Supporters of the notion that the USA is a good country to live in often point to several factors that make it a desirable destination for living. First, the high standard of living and robust economy of the USA are key factors in this regard. The per capita income in the country, as of 2015, was $56,300, one of the highest globally, highlighting the robustness of its economy. Moreover, an analysis by Joseph Sullivan for the National Review demonstrated the U.S.'s superior economic growth between 2016 and 2019 compared to other developed nations. Second, the strength of the U.S.'s education and health systems is also a significant draw. U.S. universities have a sterling reputation globally, with 40 out of the top 100 universities located in the U.S in a 2014 survey. Additionally, the U.S. surpasses the OECD average for adults aged 25-64 who have completed upper secondary education. Third, the U.S.'s environment and nature are widely admired. The country is home to a vast array of natural wonders, from sprawling canyons and towering sand dunes to huge glaciers and picturesque valleys.

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 2: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 2: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 2: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
    - Evidence 2: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 2: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
    - Evidence 2: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
","Opponents of abandoning the vow of celibacy point to various religious and personal factors. Firstly, they argue that celibacy allows a priest to focus more closely on God, a perspective supported by teachings from Paul in the Bible. This commitment is further bolstered by God's grace, providing sustenance to live a celibate life dedicated to God. Secondly, celibacy is regarded as a strong religious belief. It has been held in high esteem from the church's beginnings and is considered a spiritual marriage with Christ. Thirdly, celibacy enhances the perception of priests as holy. They argue that a priest's choice of celibate life is based on a divine love that feeds their dedication to celibacy. Fourthly, it is important to note that priests consciously choose to lead celibate lives. Various individuals have taken vows of celibacy, obedience, and poverty in front of religious authorities, indicating their willingness to live this way. Fifthly, they believe religious experiences and traditions should be preserved, as they are a testament to the long-standing value of celibacy within the Church. Finally, they argue that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts, with the Archbishop of Vienna and the Catholic Church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia suggesting a possible link between celibacy and sex abuse scandals."
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)..
    - Evidence 2: George T. Dennis SJ of Catholic University of America says: 'There is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.' Peter Fink SJ agrees, saying that underlying premises used in the book, Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy, 'would not stand up so comfortably to historical scrutiny'. Dennis says this book provides no evidence that celibacy had apostolic origins..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
    - Evidence 2: Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
- claim_4: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2004, at least 1,092 allegations of sexual abuse were made against at least 756 Catholic priests and deacons in the United States..
    - Evidence 2: Ignoring his vow of celibacy, Urbain Grandier is known to have had sexual relationships with a number of women and to have acquired a reputation as a philanderer..
- claim_5: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: In 1971, Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck,  american prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, expressed his support for the ordination of women and for ending clerical celibacy in order to address the priest shortage..
    - Evidence 2: In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy..
","the supporters argue that this vow is outdated, too difficult, unnatural, a potential cause of inappropriate sexual behavior, and it discourages people from becoming priests. They illustrate the claim that celibacy is outdated using evidence such as Pope Paul III's commutation of the vow of celibacy to conjugal fidelity in 1540 and scholars like George T. Dennis SJ and Peter Fink SJ who assert that there's no clear evidence of a tradition or obligation of priestly celibacy before the fourth century. They support the claim that celibacy is difficult with personal experiences such as Jimmy O'Brien's remark about sexual chemistry making celibacy a tough lifestyle, and historic accounts of nuns experiencing hardships following their vow of celibacy. On the unnatural nature of celibacy, they cite the argument that all living organisms are meant to reproduce, and Ford's suggestion that the conflict between celibacy and longing for intimacy contributed to Nouwen's depression. They bolster the argument that celibacy leads to wrong sexual behavior by citing the alarming number of allegations of sexual abuse against Catholic priests and deacons in the US in 2004, and instances of priests like Urbain Grandier breaking their vows of celibacy. Lastly, they argue that celibacy discourages people from becoming priests, with evidence such as Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck's support for the ordination of women and ending clerical celibacy to address priest shortage, and Gerard's complaint about York canons refusing ordination to avoid celibacy."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
    - Evidence 2: Moreover, a 2010 CDC study on child well-being and family structure shows that children from homes with married parents did better in every category..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 2: But while cohabitation is on the rise, data from Pew and other sources continue to show that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships. The marriage happiness premium extends to nearly every aspect of a couple's relationship, with one notable exception: their sex lives..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 2: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult. About eight-in-ten married adults (78%) say they feel closer to their spouse than to any other adult in their life; a narrower majority of cohabiters (55%) say the same about their partner..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
    - Evidence 2: One of the most significant advantages of marriage is eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits. First, as a married couple, you're each eligible to collect your own Social Security benefit or up to 50 percent of your spouse's benefit, whichever is greater. This can be a financial plus if one of you is a higher earner..
","Opponents argue that marriage benefits children, is important for religious or traditional reasons, brings happiness, strengthens couple bonding, and provides financial benefits. They point out that marriage benefits children, providing evidence such as the roles of mothers and fathers in a child's development, and a 2010 CDC study showing that children from homes with married parents fare better in all categories. They assert that marriage is important traditionally or religiously, with evidence of the adverse effects of father absence on children and the concept of marriage mirroring our Creator's unconditional love. They cite studies indicating that married people are generally happier than their unmarried counterparts and Pew's data that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness and satisfaction. In terms of relationship strengthening, they cite a survey indicating that married adults are more satisfied and trusting in their relationship than cohabiting adults and feel closer to their spouses than to any other adult. Lastly, they argue that marriage provides financial benefits, citing the advantages of joint income and eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
    - Evidence 2: Millions of girls around the world experience female genital mutilation (FGM) as a prerequisite to marriage or as a means to control a woman’s sexuality before marriage. This is an infringement on a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy, and as it is often performed on school-aged girls, also stops them from being able to access education and deprives them of their childhood, as well as causing both short- and long-term health consequences..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 2: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","Proponents argue that marriage perpetuates harmful norms for women, is unstable, enforces unfair obligations, and that most advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship. They argue that marriage preserves harmful norms for women, providing evidence of expectations for women to be submissive to male family members, and the occurrence of female genital mutilation as a prerequisite to marriage. They support the claim that marriages are unstable with evidence such as the upward trend in global divorce rates since the 1970s and the finding that changes in women's employment expectations have possibly influenced divorce rates. They argue that marriage enforces unfair obligations, providing examples like Qatar's laws that require women to have male guardian permission to marry and the inequality within laws governing marital relations. Lastly, they argue that the advantages of marriage can be achieved by a monogamous relationship, citing the dominance of monogamy in many societies today and the stability that a single-partner relationship offers."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 2: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 2: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
    - Evidence 2: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
","Opponents of abandoning school uniforms put forth a range of arguments in their favor. They argue that school uniforms do not inhibit self-expression, evidenced by a former Hershey High School student's op-ed and research by Andrea Dashiell, which found that 54% of eighth graders still felt expressive despite a uniform policy. Moreover, they argue that uniforms help reduce bullying, citing evidence from the Department of Education and a study commissioned by Trutex, both highlighting the role of uniforms in reducing bullying. Furthermore, proponents of school uniforms believe that they foster a sense of equality and unity among students. This is supported by a study in Texas which found that students wearing uniforms reported stronger perceptions of belonging to their school community. They also argue that uniforms encourage discipline and focus on learning. This is emphasized by the sentiment of educators like Natasha Irshad who stated that uniforms minimize distractions, allowing students to concentrate more on their studies. Lastly, they maintain that uniforms are cost-effective. An NY Post article showed that the average American family could save up to $150 per child on back-to-school clothing, which over a 12-year career could amount to a savings of $1800. A similar observation was made in a UK study comparing the costs of school uniforms and non-school outfits."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
    - Evidence 2: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 2: Based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
    - Evidence 2: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
    - Evidence 2: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
    - Evidence 2: This idea is supported by testimony from a 17-year-old student forced to wear uniforms. Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
","Supporters of abandoning school uniforms argue that uniforms stifle learning and creativity. They reference views of experts like Tara Maginnis and student Alyse Madsen, both highlighting the repressive and creativity-hindering effects of uniforms. They also believe that uniforms harm self-expression, pointing to a study carried out at Arizona State University and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which both underline students' rights to self-expression. Moreover, they contend that school uniforms are expensive, with the Children’s Society estimating the average cost of a school uniform to be £340. They also argue that school uniforms can be uncomfortable and even discriminatory, citing a GLSEN study and Laura Bates's perspective on dress codes and sexism. Finally, they argue that uniforms encourage conformity at the expense of individuality, with research showing that personal choice in clothing encourages independent thinking and better prepares children for adulthood. This argument is underscored by the experience of a 17-year-old student who felt her sense of individuality was diminished by a uniform policy."
We should abolish capital punishment,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
    - Evidence 2: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
- claim_2: The death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law..
    - Evidence 2: Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as deliberate and systematic .. extrajudicial killings, and has condemned them as crimes against humanity..
- claim_3: The death penalty prevents crimes.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 2: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","Opponents of abolishing capital punishment argue that it brings justice and closure for victims' families. This is exemplified by the statements of South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster and Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge who believe capital punishment provides closure and is warranted for heinous crimes. They also argue that capital punishment is appropriate for severe crimes, supported by the stances of the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Human Rights Watch. Furthermore, they maintain that capital punishment acts as a deterrent against crime. David Muhlhausen of the Heritage Foundation, and a study by Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd both argue that the death penalty indeed deters crime, with the latter claiming that each execution results in, on average, eighteen fewer murders."
We should abolish capital punishment,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish capital punishment', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..
    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 2: In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime..
","Supporters of abolishing capital punishment argue that it is principally wrong, harms the disenfranchised, and is irreversible. They claim that the death penalty is applied unjustly, often dependent on factors like wealth, the skill of attorneys, race, and location of the crime. They point to evidence such as the fact that over 156 people have been released from death rows due to innocence since 1973, highlighting the risk of wrongful execution. These supporters also argue that the death penalty harms the disenfranchised, asserting that the high costs associated with death penalty cases divert resources from other areas. They cite a 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts which found that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. Finally, they claim that the death penalty is irreversible, which is especially concerning given it doesn't necessarily deter crime. Freelance author Emmaline Soken-Huberty argues that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent, pointing out that the murder rate in states without the death penalty is much lower."
We should abolish intellectual property rights,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish intellectual property rights', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Intellectual property rights incentivize creativity/innovation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: By codifying intellectual property for plant breeders, UPOV aims to encourage the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society..
    - Evidence 2: Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) was a strong supporter of these committees, which aimed to further support the goals of the PRO-IP Act, centered upon protecting American intellectual property and in turn, protect innovation central to the U.S. economy and its job market..
- claim_2: Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Many economists believe that, in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced, because there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organisations to produce them.
    - Evidence 2: In relation to computer software, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) claimed in its 2011 piracy study: Public opinion continues to support intellectual property (IP) rights: Seven PC users in 10 support paying innovators to promote more technological advances...
- claim_3: Intellectual property rights protect against stealing.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If we want to continue to lead the world in producing intellectual property, we need to protect Americans' rights in that property, stated Senator Leahy..
    - Evidence 2: Operation In Our Sites is an initiative led by the NIPRCC to detect and hinder intellectual property violations on the Internet..
- claim_4: People, or a business, own their innovations and should be able to be compensated for their endeavour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intellectual property rights (IPRs) - IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation)..
    - Evidence 2: These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs..
","Opponents of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that these rights incentivize creativity and innovation, incentivize investment in developing new products, protect against stealing, and allow owners to be compensated for their efforts. They highlight the goal of intellectual property protection in promoting the development of new products, as expressed by UPOV and Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy. They further assert that without intellectual property protections, there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organizations to produce intangible assets. The Business Software Alliance's 2011 piracy study supports this view, as it showed public opinion favoring payment to innovators. Finally, they contend that intellectual property rights protect against stealing, and are essential for ensuring owners of such properties benefit financially from their creations. Senator Leahy and the NIPRCC have both highlighted the importance of protecting intellectual property rights for this purpose."

    - Evidence 1: By 1852, many in the photographic community felt that Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property were hampering the development of photography in England and had called upon him to relinquish his patent..
    - Evidence 2: Some critics of intellectual property, such as those in the free culture movement, point at intellectual monopolies as harming health (in the case of pharmaceutical patents), preventing progress, and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses, and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents..
- claim_2: Intellectual property restricts access to important information/products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Professor Lessig analyzes the tension that exists between the concepts of piracy and property in the intellectual property realm in the context of what he calls the present depressingly compromised process of making law that has been captured in most nations by multinational corporations that are interested in the accumulation of capital and not the free exchange of ideas..
    - Evidence 2: Regarding the intellectual property rights of indigenous peoples, the General Assembly recognized ..the urgent need to respect and promote the inherent rights of indigenous peoples which derive from their political, economic and social structures and from their cultures, spiritual traditions, histories and philosophies..;.
- claim_3: Intellectual property rights are unfair.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The PHM views the agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights(TRIPS) as iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries and poor patients..
    - Evidence 2: Edwin Hettinger argues that natural rights arguments for intellectual property are weak and the philosophical tradition justifying property can not guide us in thinking about intellectual property..
- claim_4: Intellectual property rights harm creativity/innovation.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By 1852, many in the photographic community felt that Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property were hampering the development of photography in England and had called upon him to relinquish his patent..
    - Evidence 2: Murray Rothbard argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain..
- claim_5: Intellectual property rights waste money.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For getting the protection for the first time, it could be bit expensive particularly if the product is complex and involves methods, designs, and processes..
    - Evidence 2: Boldrin and Levine argue that government does not ordinarily enforce monopolies for producers of other goods. This is because it is widely recognized that monopoly creates many social costs. Intellectual monopoly is no different in this respect..
- claim_6: intellectual property rights are ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: There is an argument that copyright is invalid because, unlike physical property, intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state..
    - Evidence 2: Tucker did not believe in intellectual property rights in the form of patents, on the grounds that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot rightfully be held as property..
","Supporters of abolishing intellectual property rights argue that these rights prevent the continuous improvement of products/services, restrict access to important information/products, are unfair, harm creativity/innovation, waste money, and are ineffective. They cite the case of Fox Talbot in the 19th century, whose insistence on his intellectual property rights was viewed as hampering the development of photography in England. They also argue that intellectual property rights restrict access to crucial information and products, as observed by Professor Lessig, who analyzes the tension between concepts of piracy and property. They believe that these rights are unfair and can actually harm creativity and innovation, again using the Fox Talbot example and Murray Rothbard's argument. Furthermore, they claim that intellectual property rights waste money, arguing that gaining protection can be expensive. They also assert that these rights are ineffective, with some arguing that intellectual property is not scarce and is a legal fiction created by the state."
We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Gun control is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws.  A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
    - Evidence 2: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
- claim_2: Gun ownership is a right.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson Lund, JD, PhD, Professor at George Mason University School of Law, stated, 'The right to self-defense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life'..
- claim_3: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to data from 2016, approximately 10 million people used firearms for hunting, more than 50 percent of all hunters participated in target shooting, and 22 percent of hunters visited shooting ranges (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2018)..
    - Evidence 2: In 2011, there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States, and they spent $7.7 billion on guns, sights, ammunition, and other hunting equipment..
- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
    - Evidence 2: Journalist John Stossel explained, “Criminals don’t obey the law… Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat, criminals in possession of these [illegal] weapons now have a much easier job… As the saying goes, ‘If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.'”.
","Opponents of this stance maintain that gun control is ineffective, presenting evidence such as a 2016 Bureau of Justice Statistics study that found only 10.1% of criminals obtained firearms from legal sources, while a separate study in Applied Economics Letters suggested that gun restrictions did not significantly impact murder rates. They also assert gun ownership as a fundamental right, citing the U.S. Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, which upheld an individual's right to possess firearms, as well as Professor Nelson Lund's assertion that self-defense is a 'basic natural right.' Furthermore, opponents argue that gun ownership is necessary for hunting and sports-shooting, referencing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's data that nearly half of all hunters also participate in target shooting. Lastly, the opponents argue that gun ownership promotes self-protection, with a Gallup survey indicating that 63% of gun owners cite personal safety as their primary reason for owning a firearm."
We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Banning guns would save lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death”.
    - Evidence 2: Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote 'We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.'.
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
    - Evidence 2: 'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add..
- claim_3: Guns can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
    - Evidence 2: A June 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report states that 'Almost all guns used in criminal acts enter circulation via initial legal transaction.'.
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and “89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence.”.
","Proponents for abolishing the right to keep and bear arms argue that such a measure would save lives. They cite a study from the American Journal of Public Health which associated legal handgun purchases with an increased risk of violent death, as well as Harvard professor David Hemenway's research linking greater gun availability to higher homicide rates in developed countries. Proponents also argue that gun ownership increases the risk of mass shootings and general gun violence, with evidence including a 1993 study in The New England Journal of Medicine that associated guns kept at home with an increased risk of homicide. Furthermore, they contend that guns can fall into the wrong hands, citing instances like the Sutherland Springs massacre where the shooter, despite a domestic violence conviction, was able to purchase guns. Lastly, the proponents emphasize that guns can lead to accidental deaths, especially among those under 25 years old."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Nationally, local authority budgets were cut by nearly a third from 2010 to 2018, according to the UK National Audit Office and the public health grant fell by £700m in real terms between 2014/15 and 2019/20, as revealed by a Health Foundation report. Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed..
    - Evidence 2: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,.
    - Evidence 2: In an excoriating 24-page report, which will be presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva next year, the eminent human rights lawyer Philip Alston said that in the UK 'poverty is a political choice'..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
    - Evidence 2: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
","Opponents argue that austerity cuts access to essential services, with evidence including reports of significant budget cuts to local authority budgets and welfare for children and families in the UK. They also contend that austerity exacerbates recessions, citing instances where austerity measures have had contractionary effects on economies such as Argentina, Russia, and Turkey. They assert that austerity is unfair to citizens, pointing to a UN report that described levels of child poverty in the UK as a 'social calamity and an economic disaster.' Further, opponents argue that austerity results in lower economic growth, citing Greece's economic struggles following an austerity program imposed by the EU and ECB. Finally, they claim that austerity policies lead to lower job creation, referring to the high unemployment rates in countries such as Greece and Spain following the implementation of austerity measures."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 2: For example, Canada in 1993-96, cut their fiscal deficit but maintained strong economic growth..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 2: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
    - Evidence 2: Countries use austerity measures to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. That's when creditors become concerned that the country will default on its debt. It occurs when the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is greater than 77%..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 2: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
","Proponents for adopting an austerity regime put forth the following arguments: First, they state that austerity improves economic measures. Evidence is presented through the cases of Latvia and Estonia, and Canada, where an economic rebound or sustained growth was observed following austerity measures. Secondly, supporters argue that austerity is important in the long term. They believe that reducing budget deficits boosts investors' confidence, resulting in an improved economic performance in the long run. They refer to reports from the EU Commission and certain economists as evidence. Thirdly, they assert that austerity increases stability. This is supported by examples of countries like Morocco, where austerity measures and pro-market reforms have led to economic stability, steady growth, and a gradual decrease in unemployment. Fourth, austerity is posited as necessary to reduce deficits or repay debts. This is substantiated by a World Bank study, indicating that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period, it impairs economic growth, and that austerity helps avoid a sovereign debt crisis. Finally, supporters argue that an austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times. They point to examples such as the global economic downturn of 2008, and the successful austerity model in the US between 1920 and 1921, where the federal budget was drastically cut and debt reduced, leading to economic recovery."
We should adopt atheism,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: John Locke in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos..
    - Evidence 2: As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film The Golden Compass, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be watered down from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says denigrates Christianity and promotes atheism for kids, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief..
- claim_2: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..
","Opponents of the adoption of atheism put forth these arguments: First, they state that atheism discriminates against religious people and infringes upon freedom of religion. They refer to John Locke's assertion that atheism could undermine social order and lead to chaos, and criticism towards the film 'The Golden Compass' as potential encouragement of atheism among children. Secondly, they argue that the choice to adopt atheism should be a personal one. This is supported by Liddle's argument that choosing to believe in God or not is a matter of personal preference with no scientific proof either way, and a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights stating that one cannot be forced to exhibit views or behaviors associated with a specific religion."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: La Mettrie defended a purely pleasure-based view of the proper end of human life, and advocated atheism as the only means of liberating human beings from the various forms of oppression which stand in the way of human progress..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
","Proponents for the adoption of atheism argue the following: First, they claim that atheism is beneficial to those who adopt it. They present Baggini's and La Mettrie's arguments suggesting that atheism provides a superior basis for ethics and liberation from various forms of oppression. Secondly, supporters argue that atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists. They reference Michael Scriven's and a metaphysically courageous atheist's arguments stating that atheism is justified in the absence of evidence for God's existence. Thirdly, they assert that religions are immoral and should not be followed. They argue that religion confuses obedience with morality, as true morality involves considering the consequences of actions, and state that religion is immoral as it is based on untruths. Finally, supporters claim that science can adequately explain the Universe. They provide evidence suggesting that atheists or agnostics are often more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths, and posit that the atheism offered by scientific naturalism perspective can find moral truth, objective value, and goodness."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 2: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 2: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of libertarianism support legalization of what they regard as victimless crimes, such as recreational drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
","The critics argue that libertarianism can lead to detrimental effects such as economic decline, harm to minorities, unjust societal structures, the removal of vital laws and services, and weakening the government's role in protecting citizen rights. Firstly, the critics present the example of Northern Rock's £27 billion failure, linked to libertarian economic philosophy, and the works of Steven Teles and Brink Lindsey, critiquing laws and regulations derived from poor policymaking, arguing they potentially suppress economic growth and exacerbate inequality. Secondly, citing thinkers like Robert Nozick and James P. Sterba, the critics highlight libertarianism's potential harm to minorities and those who are worse off. Nozick's potential acceptance of consensual enslavement contracts in a purely libertarian society, and Sterba's ethical arguments emphasizing the prioritization of the liberty of the poor, form part of this critique. The third argument questions the justice and equality of libertarianism. Critics utilize examples of market failures leading to unequal outcomes, like those outlined by economist Joseph Stiglitz, and historical occurrences like slavery to illustrate the potential injustices of libertarianism. Critics' fourth contention highlights the risk of losing essential laws, infrastructure, and government services under libertarianism. They underline libertarian's support for legalizing so-called 'victimless crimes' and focus on protecting natural rights, which may lead to the stripping of vital government services. Lastly, the critics highlight the essential role of government in protecting citizen rights. They cite evidence from Human Rights Watch emphasizing the government's role in safeguarding basic human rights and reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change underscoring the necessity of governmental action in environmental protection."
We should adopt libertarianism,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism increases economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Sustainability advocates Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins posited in their book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution (2000) that elements of libertarianism and green politics could be coalesced to produce economic as well as environmental benefits..
    - Evidence 2: Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity..
- claim_2: Libertarianism increases freedom in the political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
- claim_3: Libertarianism increases happiness/fulfilment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: By allowing individuals to make their own decisions about how to live their lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that individuals are happiest when they are engaged in activities that they find fulfilling and meaningful..
    - Evidence 2: By allowing individuals to take responsibility for their own lives, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own interests and goals. For example, philosopher Ayn Rand argues that individuals are happiest when they are free to act on their own judgment and pursue their own interests..
- claim_4: Libertarianism increases individual freedom/liberties.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
    - Evidence 2: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
","Supporters argue that it increases economic growth, freedom in the political system, happiness/fulfillment, and individual liberties. First, proponents cite the works of Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins, who suggest a combination of libertarianism and green politics can produce both economic and environmental benefits. They also argue that reduced taxation, a key principle of libertarianism, can lead to increased financial freedom and economic prosperity. Secondly, supporters argue that reducing government intervention leads to increased individual freedom. They reference studies by the Cato Institute and economists like Milton Friedman to assert that countries with less government intervention have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth. Thirdly, the proponents argue that libertarianism increases happiness and fulfillment. They cite psychologists like Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and philosophers like Ayn Rand, who argue that individuals are happiest when they are free to make their own decisions and pursue their interests. Finally, the supporters argue that libertarianism enhances individual liberties.

We should ban human cloning,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility..
    - Evidence 2: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility.
- claim_3: Cloning promotes health.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For example, scientists could use cloning to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases. A study by the Nature journal found that cloning could greatly advance stem cell research..
    - Evidence 2: Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at Oregon State University, says, Some traditions and leading figures in conservative Protestantism who were opposed to human cloning for reproductive reasons have come to see that given the ambiguity about their own views about the status of embryonic life, and given the potential for health benefits, they could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning..
- claim_4: Cloning promotes science/research.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 specifically permitted human cloning for the purpose of developing and harvesting human stem cells, and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two legalized certain forms of embryonic stem cell research in the state..
    - Evidence 2: On May 31, 1997, an issue of the popular science magazine New Scientist said that the International RaÃ«lian Movement was starting a company to fund the research and development of human cloning..
","We stand against the notion of banning human cloning. We believe that human cloning has the potential to bring significant benefits to our society. To begin with, our first argument is that cloning can be a lifesaver, serving as a powerful tool for organ replication. According to the World Health Organization, many people die while waiting for a suitable organ for transplantation. Cloning can alleviate this by creating personalized organs that are specific to an individual's needs, reducing the risk of rejection, and improving the success rate of transplantation. Secondly, human cloning can be a beacon of hope for those unable to have a child. Studies from the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics and the Journal of Medical Ethics demonstrate how cloning can assist couples struggling with infertility, providing them with the opportunity to have a child genetically related to them. Furthermore, human cloning promotes health and advances science. Cloning could be used to produce stem cells that can treat various diseases, as evidenced by a study in the Nature journal. Legislation like New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two have already recognized the scientific importance of cloning for stem cell research. We should not halt this progression of scientific discovery."
We should ban human cloning,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 2: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Pope John Paul II: These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself.
    - Evidence 2: The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning in 1997. The opinion states, the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
    - Evidence 2: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child..
    - Evidence 2: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
","Despite the arguments put forth, we stand firm that human cloning should be banned. Our first point is, cloning is not fully understood yet. As Kass writes, a society that tolerates cloning risks losing its ethical and moral fabric, turning procreation into an act of mere manufacture. Moreover, cloning goes against our moral and religious principles. Pope John Paul II and The National Council of Ethics of Portugal, among others, have unequivocally stated that the process of human cloning, involving manipulation and destruction of human embryos, is unacceptable. In addition, cloning is inherently unnatural. It fundamentally disrupts the familial order and the natural process of procreation. Cloning is not an act of love between two people; it is an act of cell manipulation for self-interest. Finally, cloning is unsafe. The FDA warns of the risks associated with sexually transmitted diseases in the cloning process. Plus, research in Nature Reviews Genetics reports the low success rate and potential health problems in cloned animals."

- claim_3: Private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks that armies cannot, or do not want, to do.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the journal Defense and Security Analysis in 2011 found that private military companies can provide access to specialized skills and expertise that may not be available in the regular army..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the RAND Corporation in 2013 found that private military companies can offload non-core tasks, such as security and support, from regular army personnel, allowing them to focus on their primary mission..
- claim_4: Private military companies increase safety.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Heritage Foundation in 2010 found that private military companies can provide more efficient use of resources, reducing the overall cost of military operations and allowing for a greater focus on safety..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Heritage Foundation in 2010 found that private military companies can provide support services, such as logistics and communications, improving overall safety by freeing up regular army personnel to focus on other tasks..
","We firmly oppose the banning of private military companies. Our first point is the financial benefit. Research published in the Defense and Security Analysis journal and a report by the Congressional Research Service, show that private military companies can provide more cost-effective services than traditional military personnel. Secondly, these companies often provide specialized training and have access to advanced technology. This means they are better equipped to respond to modern warfare techniques and threats, adding a valuable layer of defense. Thirdly, these companies can supplement regular armies, providing access to specialized skills and expertise not always available within traditional military structures. They can also offload non-core tasks from the regular army, allowing them to focus on their primary mission. Lastly, private military companies can enhance safety. Reports by the Heritage Foundation suggest that these companies provide essential support services, improve resource use efficiency, and thereby contribute to a safer operational environment."

    - Evidence 2: A report by Human Rights Watch in 2006 found that private military companies often prioritize profit over other considerations, including ethical and legal considerations..
- claim_5: Private military companies solicit engaging, or prolonging, conflict.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Project on Government Oversight in 2008 found that private military companies have a financial incentive to prolong conflicts, as they profit from their continued involvement..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the Congressional Research Service in 2009 found that the lack of accountability surrounding private military companies can lead to actions that prolong and escalate conflicts..
","We stand firm in our belief that private military companies should be banned. Our reasons are manifold. Firstly, these companies have shown a tendency to commit unethical practices and human rights violations. The United Nations report in 2004 highlighted their usage of child soldiers in conflict zones, and the Congressional Research Service in 2010 noted unlawful civilian killings perpetrated by these companies. Secondly, there is a significant issue regarding the lack of professionalism and accountability within these firms. Amnesty International in 2009 and Human Rights Watch in 2006 have provided evidence of poor training standards and a lack of accountability within these companies. Moreover, the loyalty of private military companies is not guaranteed, with conflicts of interest arising from serving multiple nations. A Journal of Military Ethics study in 2009 and a Congressional Research Service report in 2012 have highlighted these concerns. Further, their primary interest seems to be profit, as shown by the 2010 International Affairs study, leading to questionable ethical practices as found by the 2006 Human Rights Watch report. Lastly, these companies have a vested interest in prolonging conflict for their financial gain, as highlighted by the Project on Government Oversight report in 2008 and the Congressional Research Service report in 2009."
We should ban the use of child actors,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban the use of child actors', Its opponents argue that:

- claim_3: Child performers should not be banned as long as there is supervision/regulation.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Walsh would appear with the segments' usual roster of child actors to help illustrate scenarios in which children could often be in danger, and the solutions they could seek..

    - Evidence 2: On working as a very young child actor, Lyonne said: I didn't have the best parents..
","We firmly oppose the banning of child actors. It is not uncommon for acting to be a child's dream. The Drama Teachers Association of America in 2011 and the American Psychological Association in 2010 have highlighted how acting can be a channel for children to express their emotions and exhibit their talents. Children are also essential for certain roles, adding to the diversity in casting as pointed out by the National Association of Theatre Owners in 2013, and having played an important role in the development of drama throughout history. Furthermore, as long as there is adequate supervision and regulation, child actors should be allowed to work. It's not unheard of to film around a child actor, following child labor laws, as seen in numerous TV and film productions. Lastly, it should be the parents' decision whether their child works as an actor. The Journal of Family Psychology in 2013 affirms the importance of parents' roles in providing individualized attention and care for their children's development and well-being."

    - Evidence 1: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
    - Evidence 2: There are many instances of troubled adult lives due to the stressful environment to which child actors are subjected..
","We stand by the belief that the use of child actors should be banned. Their education is often compromised due to their work schedules, as found by the Journal of Education and Practice in 2013. The American Psychological Association in 2017 also found a correlation between the acting profession and high stress levels in child actors. Child actors are also vulnerable to exploitation. Studies published in the Journal of Adolescence in 2012 and the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014, highlighted labor violations and the risk of human trafficking in the industry. These children also risk losing their childhood as they are exposed to unhealthy working conditions, as highlighted by the 2016 UNICEF report. In addition, these young performers often experience intense pressure, leading to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, as noted by studies in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence and the Journal of Pediatrics in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Lastly, many child actors face issues in their adult life due to the stress of their careers, as shown by the troubled adult lives of many former child actors. The lack of a stable identity after their careers end can lead to profound issues, as demonstrated by the case of Herbert and other similar instances."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 2: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees, is fully compliant with the Geneva Convention, and  provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum-security prison in the world, as attested to by human rights organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led Admiral Walsh..
    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
","Opponents to the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp argue primarily on three fronts. Firstly, they maintain that closing the camp could threaten national security. Evidence from the National Intelligence director suggests that a considerable number (17.5%) of former detainees who were transferred to other countries reengaged in terrorist or insurgent activities. Moreover, among the remaining 80 detainees, most are hardened terrorists, suggesting their transfer could pose security risks. Secondly, opponents argue that the camp is more beneficial for detainees compared to alternative facilities. They cite the state-of-the-art nature of the facility, its compliance with the Geneva Convention, and the high standard of treatment provided to detainees, exceeding that of most maximum-security prisons worldwide. The camp is also notably away from population centers, thus ensuring maximum security and minimising escape risks. Lastly, they highlight the essential role the camp plays in intelligence gathering. Guantanamo Bay, initially chosen for its strategic advantages, has evolved into an intelligence center, crucial for understanding the operation of terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda. The ability to bring terrorists into this center presents an unprecedented opportunity to protect the nation through the collection of vital intelligence."

- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 2: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
    - Evidence 2: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
    - Evidence 2: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
","Supporters of closing Guantanamo Bay detention camp primarily argue that detainees should have the right to trial in U.S. courts. They refer to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of Boumediene v. Bush, which granted detainees the right to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts. The camp is also viewed as damaging the U.S. image and reputation, being seen as a disregard for the rule of law and a recruiting tool for terrorists. Guantanamo Bay is further perceived as a symbol of injustice and discrimination, making it a target for global criticism. Supporters point out that the camp has been a center of abuse and disregard for the rule of law. They also emphasize the significant costs associated with the camp. With an annual cost of $540 million and around $13 million per prisoner, critics argue that the camp is unduly expensive. Allegations of crimes against prisoners and unjust treatment and tactics used at the camp provide additional reasons for closure. Evidence of abuse, torture, and unfair legal processes make the camp a contentious issue, with some viewing it as a violation of human rights."
We should end affirmative action,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect..
    - Evidence 2: Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, told CBS News, 'If we as a nation are serious about creating equity and justice, we have to institute programs that have been proven to create more equity in our schools, in our colleges, and our workplaces.' He added, 'Affirmative action programs in education have been demonstrated to increase diversity and increase access specifically for underrepresented groups.'.
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
    - Evidence 2: In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation's economic opportunities [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
    - Evidence 2: The National Organization for Women (NOW) stated the following in its article 'Talking About Affirmative Action,':'Affirmative Action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95% to 97% of the high-level corporate jobs. And that’s with affirmative action programs in place. Imagine how low figures would be without affirmative action.'.
","Opponents of ending affirmative action argue that it increases diversity, compensates for the past, and reduces discrimination. Diversity in schools, colleges, and workplaces has been demonstrated to increase due to affirmative action, with one study showing a significant decline in the admission of students of color to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban. They also posit that affirmative action is necessary to correct past discrimination, with the policy defined as a means to rectify past or present discrimination and prevent future occurrences. This stance is supported by President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1965 endorsement of affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation. Finally, opponents argue that affirmative action reduces discrimination. Evidence from Johnson v. Transportation Agency upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' in traditionally segregated job categories. The National Organization for Women (NOW) also pointed out that affirmative action levels the playing field, allowing people of color and women to compete more equitably in education and business."
We should end affirmative action,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some opponents believe, among other things, that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group it's supposed to help, therefore making affirmative action counter-productive..
    - Evidence 2: Opponents of affirmative action such as George Sher believe that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who are chosen based on the social group to which they belong rather than their qualifications [REF]..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2010 Arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action known as Proposition 107 [REF]..
    - Evidence 2: With privileged African Americans gaining professional upward mobility through affirmative action and equal opportunity sanctions in education and employment, the less-skilled, less-educated African Americans fall behind..
- claim_3: Affirmative action is not just.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students. Students for Fair Admissions Inc. is in the process of suing Harvard University, alleging that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students. Race-blind admission testing would allow the students, with top test scores in the country, a place at a prestigious university. Instead, they are marked down on “personality trait” testing, in which they coincidentally and consistently score low..
    - Evidence 2: Affirmative action is peak performative activism, as it focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities..
- claim_4: Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Opponents,[REF] who sometimes say that affirmative action is 'reverse discrimination', further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects in addition to failing to achieve its goals..
    - Evidence 2: Some policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial quotas or gender quotas for collegiate admission, have been criticised as a form of reverse discrimination, and such implementation of affirmative action has been ruled unconstitutional by the majority opinion of Gratz v. Bollinger..
- claim_5: Affirmative action reduces quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
    - Evidence 2: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
","Proponents claim that affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities. They argue that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of those it aims to help, as it may create a perception that they achieved success not due to their abilities but because of their minority status. This is supported by evidence such as views of opponents like George Sher, who argues that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of individuals chosen based on their social group rather than their qualifications. The proponents further contend that affirmative action is ineffective, as evidenced by the passage of a constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action (Proposition 107) by Arizona voters in 2010. Moreover, they highlight the discrepancies within minority groups, where privileged African Americans gain upward mobility through affirmative action while the less-skilled and less-educated counterparts are left behind. Another significant claim raised by supporters of ending affirmative action is that it is unjust, particularly to Asian-American students. The ongoing lawsuit by Students for Fair Admissions Inc. against Harvard University alleges that the university caps the number of admissions for Asian American students, suggesting a bias in the admission process. Furthermore, they argue that affirmative action is a form of performative activism, as it seems more concerned about appearances rather than ensuring marginalized communities have equal opportunities.The stance against affirmative action is also premised on the belief that it perpetuates prejudice and is a form of reverse discrimination. This belief is supported by the ruling of Gratz v. Bollinger, where certain policies adopted as affirmative action, such as racial or gender quotas, were ruled as unconstitutional. Lastly, ending affirmative action supporters argue it reduces quality. Citing Clint Bolick and data from the University of Texas, they point out that less-qualified minorities are often given preference over more-qualified non-minorities due to race-based affirmative action programs. They argue these programs mask the deeper systemic issues in education and training, ultimately doing a disservice to those they aim to assist."

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) in 2010 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready supports active aging, as older workers can continue to contribute to the workforce, using their skills and experience to benefit society..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the World Health Organization in 2013 found that allowing people to retire when they are ready can promote well-being, as it gives individuals greater control over their lives and allows them to pursue activities that bring them happiness and fulfillment..
","Supporters of ending mandatory retirement contend that it decreases institutional knowledge. By citing policies like the UK's lack of a mandatory retirement age for Air Traffic Controllers, they highlight that this policy can harm the economy by impeding workforce diversity and decreasing labor force participation, as indicated by the World Economic Forum and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Proponents further argue that mandatory retirement is unfair and discriminatory, often resulting in age discrimination. They point to a report by the American Association of Retired Persons and a study by the International Labour Organization, which indicate that mandatory retirement disregards individual circumstances such as health, financial status, and personal preferences. There is also a concern about the reduction in the quality of life for those forced to retire, as evidenced by research indicating health declines and decreased economic well-being following mandatory retirement. Supporters conclude with the argument that people should retire when they are ready, a move that promotes active aging and individual well-being, as evidenced by the American Association of Retired Persons and the World Health Organization."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..
","In the topic of 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', those opposing the argument posit that nuclear weapons are crucial for deterrence and protection. They substantiate this stance with evidence that highlights how the strategy of deterrence has been effective in maintaining peace for nearly 70 years. An example provided is the invasion of Ukraine, which, they argue, was not a failure of nuclear deterrence, as Ukraine was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. Instead, the instance is used to point out that countries without deterrence protection are more susceptible to such a fate, while those under its protection are safe from major, frontal military attacks."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 2: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 2: On 21 September 2022, Mr Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” of Russian citizens to serve in the war in Ukraine. He also accused NATO members of making statements about “the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia”. He threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory: In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff..
","Supporters of the abolition of nuclear weapons argue that these weapons pose significant risks, such as falling into the wrong hands. They cite recent propaganda from ISIS claiming they could acquire nuclear weapons within a year. They also reference the possibility of accidents, human errors, irresponsible leadership, nuclear terrorism, hacking of the nuclear chain of command, or a combination of these factors. Additionally, they argue that nuclear weapons could provoke or escalate disastrous military action, providing evidence of potential casualty estimates from a hypothetical Soviet nuclear attack during the Cold War. They further underline Russia's recent threats to use nuclear weapons during the ongoing Ukraine conflict."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives..
    - Evidence 2: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
    - Evidence 2: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
","Those against this viewpoint argue that urbanization offers more opportunities, benefits the economy, and even the environment. They put forward evidence that migration to urban areas is generally motivated by the promise of a better life, and that urbanization leads to increased economic opportunities. As an example, they refer to China's urbanization policies that encouraged privatization of agriculture, rural industrial development, and international investment. They also assert that urbanization has positive effects on economic growth, bringing technological advancements and diversifying products and occupations. On the environmental front, they claim that urbanization drives the development of green technologies and leads to higher productivity with lower ecological footprint due to economies of scale and positive externalities."
We should fight urbanization,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in the rural areas economically/socially.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..
    - Evidence 2: Protection of this natural resource eliminated the causes (i.e., income risk and health effects) that facilitate rural to urban migration by protecting a natural resource base by which rural residents in India depended for their existence..

    - Evidence 1: MÄori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with social issues stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid urbanisation and growing population have increased criminal activities in Bopal & Ghuma..
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization are associated with a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (see also acid rain) and hydrogen sulfide, which may affect plant metabolism..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 2: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..
","Proponents make several claims, starting with the notion that restrictions on migration would economically and socially benefit people in rural areas. They provide evidence from Venezuela, where urbanization has led to significant rural depopulation and abandonment, resulting in the country becoming a net food importer despite its rich arable lands. In contrast, the protection of natural resources in rural India limited the drivers of rural to urban migration. The proponents also argue that urbanization results in increased crime rates. They point to the increased urban crime rates observed in Māori communities and Bopal & Ghuma due to rapid urbanization and population growth. Further, they contend that urbanization harms the environment by polluting water supplies and increasing emissions of harmful pollutants such as sulfur dioxide. Finally, supporters argue that urbanization strains city resources, leading to poor living conditions, inadequate housing, and the creation of slums, backed by evidence from a UNESCO report and academic studies."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 2: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
- claim_2: Citizens have a right not to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
    - Evidence 2: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..
","The opponents argue that abstaining from a vote also reflects personal preferences. They cite evidence suggesting that abstention can indicate ambivalence, mild disapproval, or even a lack of adequate information about the issue at hand. They also argue that citizens have the right not to vote, a standpoint backed by U.S. legal scholars who see compulsory voting as a compelled speech act, violating freedom of speech. Opponents also believe that compulsory voting may lead to uninformed or random voting, as less informed voters are more susceptible to the influence of sensational advertising, potentially leading to misleading campaign tactics."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
","Supporters of compulsory voting assert that it increases representation. They emphasize that with mandatory voting, politicians must address the needs of all voters, not just those who are more likely to vote voluntarily. They also argue that compulsory voting can stimulate greater interest in politics, as citizens are likely to pay more attention to political issues if they are obligated to vote. Moreover, supporters believe that citizens have an obligation to vote, noting that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms according to the European Court of Human Rights."
We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore found that heavy, chronic smoking of marijuana (138 joints per week) changed blood proteins associated with heart disease and stroke..
    - Evidence 2: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anslinger claimed cannabis caused people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally and overly sexual..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
- claim_3: Cannabis is a gateway-drug/addictive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..
    - Evidence 2: In 2006, the Karolinska Institute in Sweden used twelve rats to examine how adolescent use of cannabis affects subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
- claim_4: Legal cannabis can be getting to the hand of underage teenagers/children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 2: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..
","Opponents argue that cannabis harms the body, pointing to a 2008 study from the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre that shows heavy cannabis smoking alters blood proteins linked to heart disease and stroke. They also reference Dutch research indicating that increased THC content may impair psychomotor skills, particularly in younger or inexperienced smokers. They argue that cannabis usage increases lack of judgement and can lead to accidents. Evidence for this includes a report showing that between 2000 to 2018, the percentage of fatal car crashes involving cannabis rose from 9% to 21.5%. Opponents also fear that cannabis is a gateway drug and can be addictive, citing the National Institute on Drug Abuse's explanation that THC triggers dopamine release, leading to a desire for repeated usage and potential addiction. Additionally, a 2006 study from the Karolinska Institute showed THC-altered opioid systems in rats, leading to more heroin usage. Lastly, they express concern that legalized cannabis could easily fall into the hands of underage teenagers or children. They cite the example of Alaska, where legalization in the 1970s resulted in the state's teens using cannabis at twice the national average, leading to its re-criminalization in 1990."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
- claim_3: Cannabis is safe/healthy/pain-relief.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 2: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
    - Evidence 2: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
","Proponents argue that legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, which are more harmful, remain legal. They point to a 2002 DAWN report which showed that legal drugs caused more than half a million deaths a year. Proponents also argue that cannabis can be financially beneficial. They argue that its legalization could save billions in government spending on prohibition enforcement and generate billions more in annual tax revenues. Advocates for legalization also believe cannabis to be safe, with some therapeutic benefits. They argue that legalizing cannabis could result in regulated use and distribution. Finally, they claim that legalization could reduce black-market activity and criminal behavior, arguing that decriminalization would significantly decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black-market cannabis sales and trafficking."
We should legalize prostitution,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
    - Evidence 2: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
    - Evidence 2: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
    - Evidence 2: Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men..
","Opponents of this stance put forth three main arguments. Firstly, they argue that legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases. They back this up with studies showing an increase in HIV cases among prostitutes in Athens and the role of prostitution in maintaining STDs in the general population in places like Kenya. Secondly, they assert that legalization will promote immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking. They substantiate this with a report revealing a rise in organized crime and violence in Amsterdam's sex trade post-legalization, and research indicating a strong connection between prostitution, drug use, and non-drug crimes. Lastly, they contend that the legalization of sex work will escalate violence against women. Critics highlight Sweden's experience, where the proposition of legislation led to warnings of an increase in violence, along with feminist views emphasizing the perceived exploitation and reinforcement of patriarchal dominance involved in prostitution."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Liquor, gambling, and prostitution were ubiquitous, supported in Seattle by one of the city's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, who believed that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 2: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 2: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 2: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 2: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
","Proponents of legalizing prostitution present several arguments. They maintain that legalization can boost the economy, pointing to historical examples where prostitution was deemed a functional part of the economy in places like Seattle. They also argue that legalization will increase sex workers' benefits, such as safety, health, and human rights, and cite advocacy from the Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour for more equitable regulations. Further, they argue that legalization will make the profession safer for women and improve regulation. This is supported by evidence from Dutch and Las Vegas policies that favored harm reduction and acknowledged the pragmatic benefits of a regulated sex trade. They also advocate that sex work is a valid personal choice and underscore the normalization and potential benefits of prostitution as seen in several studies."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
    - Evidence 2: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
    - Evidence 2: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 2: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
","Critics of this proposition argue that sex selection can lead to gender imbalance, citing the skewed gender ratios in India and China due to a preference for boys. They also argue that sex selection reaffirms gender biases, with evidence from China showing son preference in strictly traditional families and rural areas even in the face of modernization and improved women's status. Lastly, they point out that sex selection can lead to abortions and infanticide, evidenced by the neglect and infanticide of girls resulting from China's one-child policy and son preference, which have been further exacerbated by improved sex-selection technology."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 2: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 2: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
","Supporters of this stance argue for five key points. Firstly, they believe that it falls within the parents' freedoms to select the gender of their child. This is based on the evidence that most people harbor a slight preference for their baby's gender, and without gender selection, the desired gender is left to chance. Secondly, proponents argue that sex selection allows for better family planning. They cite that in countries with birth limitations, gender selection offers parents control over the number of children they want, particularly if they desire a specific gender for their first-born. The third argument is that sex selection contributes to family happiness and completeness. This is supported by the fact that adoption allows families with gender preferences a legal way to choose their offspring's gender. Furthermore, it's believed that parents who have the opportunity to choose their child's gender will feel more fulfilled, potentially leading to a happier family environment. Fourth, supporters suggest that sex selection can help prevent diseases in children. This is particularly relevant for diseases linked to a particular sex, where gender selection can prevent transmission of these conditions. Finally, proponents argue that sex selection could prevent abortions or infanticide, based on the evidence that gender preference can sometimes lead to the horrific act of infanticide if a child of the undesired sex is born. Sex selection could mitigate this risk."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 2: Judge White did not go so far as to say that flag-burning is not constitutionally protected; rather, he wrote that without the benefit of the majority's thinking if it were to find flag burning protected by the First Amendment, I would sustain such a conviction..
","Opponents of this stance argue on two primary points. Firstly, they argue that flag burning is an effective tool of expression, protest, or critique. This viewpoint stems from past instances, such as the case of Gregory Lee Johnson in 1984, whose act of flag burning was deemed a form of protected expression under the First Amendment. Secondly, opponents argue that flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression. They reference court rulings, such as that of Justice William Brennan, who concluded that flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Warren was of the opinion that laws against flag-burning are constitutional.
    - Evidence 2: By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag..
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
","Supporters of the prohibition of flag burning put forward two main arguments. Firstly, they maintain that flags are important symbols that should be respected. They reference the historical precedence of laws against flag burning and the flag's symbolic significance, which they believe should be respected and not desecrated. Secondly, they argue that flag burning is an inflammatory act, deserving to be outlawed. They cite instances like Khalid's protest in 2003 as examples of flag burning being used to incite negativity and anti-patriotic sentiments."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
    - Evidence 2: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 2: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 2: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 2: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
","Opponents to the prohibition of women in combat argue firstly, that women and men should be equal in all respects, citing the European Union's legislative history of promoting equality between genders, and women's increased life expectancy and labor participation as evidence of progress towards equality. They assert that women are an asset in combat, citing historical examples of women successfully participating in combat roles since the Revolutionary War and studies suggesting women are not more susceptible to combat-related mental health issues than men. Further, they contend that women bring unique skills and strategies to combat, and argue that women's diverse perspectives and problem-solving abilities have proven to enhance team performance in combat situations. They cite the first two female Ranger School graduates, an Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters, and female SOE agents from World War II who performed dangerous missions with remarkable skill as examples. Moreover, they argue that women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat as men, offering historical examples of women's exceptional bravery and ability in combat, such as Maria Bochkareva's leadership of the 1st Russian Women's Battalion of Death in World War I, and the fact that female soldiers have fought and died in combat despite being officially barred from combat duties. In addition, they claim that women should be allowed to serve in combat if they choose to do so, arguing that women have already been unofficially serving and excelling on the battlefield. They argue that prohibitions against women serving in combat are sexist, and that women who meet the required fitness standards should be allowed to serve in combat roles, with the UK's Physical Employment Standards as an example of a gender-free fitness assessment."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
    - Evidence 2: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
    - Evidence 2: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
    - Evidence 2: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..
    - Evidence 2: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
","Supporters of the prohibition argue that men are better suited to combat roles than women, citing biological differences in size, bone mass, muscle density, and the ability to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. They argue that women are not able to overcome physical, emotional, and mental barriers as men can, suggesting that only a small fraction of women possess the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units. Furthermore, they claim that women in combat can distract men or harm the function of the military, arguing that cultural norms about men's protective feelings towards women can cause issues in mixed-gender combat teams. They also suggest that women should serve in safer, non-combat roles, citing historical examples of women serving successfully in such roles during World War II. Lastly, they express concern about the safety and treatment of female soldiers if captured, arguing that women are less able to resist interrogation and stress, and referencing instances of female soldiers being captured and assaulted in previous wars."
We should subsidize journalism,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its opponents argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Political endorsements create more opportunities to construe favoritism in reporting, and can create a perceived conflict of interest..
    - Evidence 2: Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they provide a safe harbor for biased journalism..
",Opponents of subsidizing journalism argue that government intervention could result in biased reporting or harm the objectivity of the media. They cite instances where political endorsements have been seen to create favoritism in reporting and create perceived conflicts of interest. They also reference complaints against Time Warner by the Church of Scientology that argue that subsidizing journalism could provide a safe harbor for biased journalism.
We should subsidize journalism,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..
    - Evidence 2: Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting..
- claim_2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news..
    - Evidence 2: Further technological development within the world of the Internet points to a trend of increased usage of non-institutionalized, non-governmental, non-administrative and clearly transnational information during reporting and research work..
- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The IFJ launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative in 2008, a global campaign to defend standards and to raise awareness of the importance of quality journalism..
    - Evidence 2: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..
","Those advocating for the subsidization of journalism argue that this would ensure the viability, quality, and accountability of the sector. They cite the vast influx of digital information, often unverified, from blogs and comments on news stories that make it difficult to sift through information and hence, reinforce the need for professional journalism. The phenomenon of organizations like WikiLeaks filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism, they argue, is a reactionary move to decreasing funds and resources for such reporting. Supporters underscore the role of journalism in spreading accurate information and holding powers accountable, pointing to how the Associated Press has provided factual reporting on state and national events to meet the escalating demand for news. Furthermore, they highlight the increased usage of non-institutionalized, transnational information during reporting and research work, facilitated by further technological development within the internet realm. The advocates also maintain that subsidies can bolster the quality of journalism, with the International Federation of Journalists' (IFJ) Ethical Journalism Initiative in 2008 exemplifying efforts to defend standards and raise awareness about the importance of quality journalism. They also posit that subsidies can facilitate media plurality in the EU, thus encouraging democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 2: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 2: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 2: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
","Those opposing the subsidization of space exploration posit that the private sector, such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, has demonstrated their ability to carry out successful space missions, negating the need for state-funded initiatives. They point out how SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic have accomplished feats in space travel, previously the domain of nations, such as transporting astronauts to the International Space Station and delivering cargo to low Earth orbit. Critics also underscore the high costs associated with space exploration, citing the Tsiolkovsky equation which illustrates the vast amounts of propellant needed to lift mass into orbit. Moreover, they mention the substantial costs of space travel, including the $500 to $700 million cost every time the space shuttle flies. Space exploration is argued to be scientifically useless, with the shuttle, space station, and moon/mars missions cited as examples. They even quote Bill Nye as calling space exploration a waste of time. Critics also argue that there are more pressing issues to fund than space exploration, such as poverty, and the potential dangers and resource waste associated with space missions."
We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,gpt4,top2_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
    - Evidence 2: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 2: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
    - Evidence 2: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
    - Evidence 2: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..
","Supporters of the subsidization of space exploration argue that it paves the way for colonizing the resources and lands of other planets, with space colonies being capable of providing clean energy and new homelands for our species. They also assert that it aids in the advancement of science and technology, pointing to the significant research conducted during manned space missions, and the beneficial applications of satellite imagery and climate data in sectors like agriculture. Advocates also state that space exploration is financially beneficial, with Morgan Stanley projecting the global space industry to generate revenue of more than $1 trillion by 2040. Satellite broadband, in particular, is seen as a significant opportunity, providing internet access to under-served parts of the world and supporting the growing demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and more. They also argue that space exploration is crucial for the future survival of humanity. The development of sustainable technologies for off-world outposts is seen as instrumental for both space exploration and preserving Earth's wellbeing. Moreover, innovations from space exploration have found commercial applications, contributing to sustainability efforts. Finally, they underscore how space exploration allows us to unravel information about the universe, offering valuable data about the solar system and contributing to our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe, galaxies"

    - Evidence 1: A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education can divert money from other important programs, such as early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the National Science Board in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education may not ensure quality, as many programs may not meet standards for curriculum, instruction, and assessment..
- claim_2: subsidizing vocational education is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the Center for American Progress in 2018 found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be expensive, as many programs require significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty..
    - Evidence 2: A study by the National Center for Postsecondary Research in 2020 found that subsidizing vocational education programs can be limited by the ability to scale, as many programs may not have the resources or infrastructure to serve large numbers of students..
- claim_3: subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The study found that a large-scale subsidy program for vocational education in Germany led to a significant increase in enrollment in vocational programs and a decline in enrollment in academic programs. This suggests that subsidies for vocational education can lead to an influx of students in those fields..
    - Evidence 2: The study analyzed the effects of a program in Germany that provided subsidies for vocational training and found that the program increased the demand for skilled workers in the relevant trades. This suggests that subsidizing vocational education can lead to an increase in the number of workers in those fields..
- claim_4: vocational education is not a good career choice.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A report by the National Center for Education and the Economy in 2014 found that many vocational education programs offer limited transferability of skills, making it difficult for workers to transition to new careers or industries, even when job opportunities change..
    - Evidence 2: A report by the American Federation of Teachers in 2019 found that many vocational education programs do not provide opportunities for advancement, making it difficult for workers to move up the career ladder, even if they have the skills and experience..
","Opponents argue a range of points. First, they contend that subsidizing vocational education diverts funds from more essential causes. They cite a 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which argues that such subsidies could detract from early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education programs. Their second argument revolves around the high cost of subsidizing vocational education. According to a 2018 report by the Center for American Progress, such programs often require significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty. Thirdly, they argue that subsidies can cause an influx in those professions, potentially saturating the market. A German study demonstrated that vocational education subsidies led to a surge in vocational program enrollments, thereby increasing the supply of skilled workers in relevant trades. Lastly, opponents suggest that vocational education is not a desirable career choice. Reports from the National Center for Education and the Economy and the American Federation of Teachers point out that vocational education programs often lack skill transferability and opportunities for career advancement, respectively."

    - Evidence 2: A report by the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that investments in vocational education can enhance social mobility by providing access to training and education in in-demand fields, which can benefit the entire market and society by increasing the opportunities available to individuals from diverse backgrounds..
","Proponents for subsidizing vocational education argue that such subsidies promote those with fewer resources. The National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium in 2019 found that these subsidies improve workforce development, especially for individuals facing employment barriers. Secondly, proponents argue that vocational education better fits many students. A Georgetown University study in 2020 concluded that vocational education provides a more direct employment path, meeting current workforce needs and offering relevant education. They further argue that vocational education is a good career choice. Citing a 2022 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, supporters highlight high demand for skilled workers in industries like healthcare and technology, where vocational education can provide necessary training. Finally, supporters maintain that vocational education benefits the entire market and society. They cite a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, which found that vocational education can fill in-demand jobs, thereby benefiting the entire market and society.

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
    - Evidence 2: Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 2: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying argue that if a person does not wish to take advantage of a change in the law which would allow for an assisted death then that is down to personal choice..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 2: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
","Topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'

Opponents' Arguments Summary:
Opponents of the criminalization of assisted suicide argue that it provides dignity to the individuals who desire it. They emphasize the principle of personal autonomy, highlighting that the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee in 2005 argued for terminally ill people's right to medical assistance for death, similar to the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment.

The opponents further contend that assisted suicide can reduce suffering, as backed by studies reporting that the availability of assisted death can provide peace of mind to terminally ill individuals, reducing the distress associated with their pain and suffering.

The opponents also argue that individuals should have the freedom to choose to end their lives, a stance held by the plaintiffs in Canada who advocated for medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults.

Lastly, they insist that the terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide as it provides a preferable alternative to enduring pain or suffering. This point is underpinned by arguments favoring euthanasia, as well as experiences from places where euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide is legal."

    - Evidence 2: The State of New York had enacted a prohibition against physician-assisted suicide, making it a crime for a physician to administer lethal medication or to otherwise knowingly and intentionally end the life of a patient, even a consenting, mentally competent, and terminally ill patient..
- claim_2: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..

    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
    - Evidence 2: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
","Topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'

Supporters' Arguments Summary:
Those who argue for assisted suicide to be criminalized assert that it infringes upon the doctor's role as a healer, citing Dr. Lynda Young's statement that physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with this role.

They posit that individuals do not have the right to self-harm or harm others, drawing upon the New Zealand Medical Association's stance opposing voluntary euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide due to its unethical nature.

The supporters also argue that ill individuals may not have clear judgement and require help, referring to Emanuel's caution about potential involuntary euthanasia of vulnerable groups, if physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia are permitted."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschooling is often the best option for catering for the needs of exceptional/religious/ill/disabled students..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gallup polls of American voters have shown a significant change in attitude in the last twenty years, from 73% opposed to home education in 1985 to 54% opposed in 2001..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, living temporarily abroad, and to allow for more traveling; also many young athletes and actors are taught at home..
- claim_2: Homeschools can be personalized to the child's pace/needs.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 2: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools have a lot of violence/bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 1980, Holt said, 'I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to protect their children from violence, drugs andalcohol, psychological abuse, and ill-timed sexuality; help their children accomplish more academicallythan they can accomplish in school; and individualize each child's curriculum, instruction, and learningenvironment.
- claim_4: Parents should be permitted to choose the education of their children.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Home education is favored by a growing number of parents who take direct responsibility for their children's education rather than enrolling them in local public schools seen as not meeting expectations..
    - Evidence 2: Homeschoolers want to have a deeper understanding of their children's educationprogress than school reports provide and to give their children the liberty to explore their own family'sculture, free from the constraints of government-controlled systems and institutions.

","Topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned'

Opponents' Arguments Summary:
Opponents of the ban on homeschooling assert that it is often the best educational option for exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students. They cite changes in American voters' attitudes towards homeschooling and the suitability of homeschooling for families living in isolated locations or abroad, or for young athletes and actors.

They further argue that homeschooling can be personalized according to a child's pace and needs, and refer to Nelson's point that personalizing education leads to higher engagement. They emphasize that this personalized approach can better meet the needs of students with special educational needs compared to mainstream schools.

Opponents also point to the issue of violence and bullying in mainstream schools as reasons to oppose a ban on homeschooling.

They insist that parents should have the right to choose their children's education, seeing homeschooling as a means to take direct responsibility for their children's learning.

Lastly, opponents believe that a home is a good learning environment. They reference the broader socialization homeschooling can provide and the opportunities it gives for children to structure their own days. They also suggest that the home environment allows for a deeper understanding of a child's educational progress."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 2: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
- claim_4: Parents are not qualified as teachers.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 2: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..
","Debate Topic: Homeschooling should be banned

Supporting Stance:

Argument: Homeschools cannot be adequately regulated or standardized.
Evidence: Homeschooling, without the appropriate regulation and oversight, opens up potential for abuse and deprives children of important safety nets provided by the traditional schooling system, such as detection of child abuse, ensuring adequate nutrition, and vaccination requirements.

Argument: Mainstream schools are essential for the development of social skills.
Evidence: Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard Law School professor, emphasizes that traditional schooling environments foster community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination, and tolerance of others' viewpoints, which are vital for a child's holistic growth.

Argument: Mainstream schools offer higher educational quality.
Evidence: Teachers in public schools are required to carry education degrees, potentially making them more equipped and experienced in teaching children. Even the National Education Association, a teachers' union, is opposed to homeschooling.

Argument: Parents may not be as qualified as professional teachers.
Evidence: Homeschooling often puts enormous responsibility and workload on parents. They not only need to ensure quality education but also have to administer other roles such as coordinating activities, meeting local authority requirements, and preparing children for exams, which can lead to stress and fatigue."

    - Evidence 2: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University.

","Opposing View: Social media platforms should not be regulated by the government

Opponents argue that government regulation of social media is not only ineffective, but also harms privacy and freedom of speech, interferes with private business operations, and could be abused for political purposes.

Ineffectiveness of Regulation: Despite the introduction of significant legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, evidence shows that there has been little action against major companies like Facebook and Google over their data collection practices.

Privacy Concerns: A Pew Research Center survey reveals that most people feel they have little control over their personal information and that the potential risks of data collection by companies and government outweigh the benefits.

Threat to Freedom of Speech: Instances of social media regulation have often resulted in the suppression of free speech. For example, following the enactment of a cybersecurity law in Vietnam, Facebook began to restrict content significantly, impacting activists and journalists. A United Nations human rights expert warns that almost every country adopting laws related to online content has jeopardized human rights.

Interference in Private Business: Critics argue that government intervention can disrupt market equilibrium, potentially extending economic recessions or depressions. Government spending on public goods may also lead to excess bureaucracy and inefficiency.

Risk of Political Abuse: Past incidents, such as the targeted political advertisements during the 2016 elections in the US and UK aimed at suppressing voting and political participation, highlight the potential for governments to abuse social media regulations for political purposes."

","Supporting View: Social media platforms should be regulated by the government

Supporters argue that government regulation of social media is necessary to protect younger audiences, tackle fake news, benefit society at large, manage negative content, and deal with malicious users.

Protection of Young Audiences: Government intervention is necessary to protect young people online. The tragic case of Molly Russell, a British teenager who was exposed to distressing content on social media, underscores this need.

Tackling Fake News: The prevalence of disinformation, particularly during election periods, as seen with the Russian propaganda during the US 2016 election, necessitates government regulation to ensure the veracity of news content.

Societal Benefits: OfcomÕs Chief Executive, Dame Melanie Dawes, believes that the many benefits of being online must be balanced with the need to protect users from serious harm and protect free expression.

Managing Negative Content: The rise of harmful or misleading content online indicates a need for regulation. As Zimana's Pierre DeBois suggests, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms handle issues like disinformation or hate speech.

Dealing with Malicious Users: The high number of unauthorized access to social media accounts and the interference of foreign entities in national affairs, such as the Russian operation Internet Research AgencyÕs involvement in the 2016 US election, highlight the urgent need for government regulation to ensure user safety and national security."

- claim_1: The US has unfair health and education policies.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In 2007, 8.1 million children under 18 years old were without health insurance. Children in poverty and Hispanic children were more likely to be uninsured..
    - Evidence 2: Adults in households with annual incomes under $40,000 are more than three times as likely as adults in households with incomes over $90,000 to say it is difficult to afford their health care costs (69% v. 21%)..
- claim_2: The US has a problematic/divisive political system.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In their study of polarization across nations, Thomas Carothers and Andrew O’Donohue argue that polarization runs particularly deep in the U.S. in part because American polarization is 'especially multifaceted.'.
    - Evidence 2: According to Carothers and O’Donohue, a “powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion renders America’s divisions unusually encompassing and profound..
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045). Simply living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, researchers suggest..
    - Evidence 2: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..
    - Evidence 2: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The United States’ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019—the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany—according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..
    - Evidence 2: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
    - Evidence 2: A country where, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 253 mass shootings in the country since the beginning of 2019. That’s more shootings than days. Two of those occurred over the weekend in less than 24 hours, first in El Paso, Texas followed by Dayton, Ohio, leaving 31 dead..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..
    - Evidence 2: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
","Debate Summary:

Opponents to the motion 'The USA is a good country to live in' argue that:

The US has unfair health and education policies, as demonstrated by high uninsured rates among children and low-income adults struggling to afford healthcare costs.

The political system is divisive and problematic due to its deep-rooted polarization and powerful alignment of ideology, race, and religion.

The culture is often seen negatively, as lifestyle risks and lack of respect for one another characterize the society.

High taxation and the increasing cost of living, particularly for essential goods and services, impose financial threats to many citizens.

There is significant wealth and income inequality, as indicated by a high Gini coefficient and skewed wealth distribution favoring the top 10%.

Safety is a concern with low perceived safety ratings and high frequency of mass shootings.

The country struggles with racism and xenophobia, as evident in discriminatory labor practices and health disparities experienced by racial minorities."

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
    - Evidence 2: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
- claim_5: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 2: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..
","Topic: The vow of celibacy should be abandoned

Opponents' Arguments

Claim: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
Evidence: Advocates perceive clerical celibacy as a divine gift that helps priests to dedicate more freely to God's service and align their lifestyle to that of Jesus Christ, thereby enhancing their religious services (Wills, Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit).

Evidence: This is evident in the encyclical Sacerdotalis caelibatus by Pope Paul VI, which discusses priestly celibacy.

Claim: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
Evidence: Early councils of the Church such as Carthage decreed that clergy should observe perfect continence as a means to be more closely aligned with the divine and maintain their purity.

Claim: Priests choose to be celibates.
Evidence: According to Philippe Delhaye, celibacy was initially a choice for priests, bishops, and deacons, highlighting the individual's volition in the decision.

Claim: Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained.
Evidence: Siricius, an early pope, emphasized that clerical continence is part of immemorial, even apostolic, tradition that has remained till date.

Claim: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.

- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..
    - Evidence 2: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
- claim_3: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy is an unnatural act in nature. All living organisms are meant to reproduce. The sexual act is critical for the survival of the species..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..

","Topic: The vow of celibacy should be abandoned

Proponents' Arguments

Claim: Celibacy is outdated.
Evidence: Scholars like Lakeland and Egan believe that celibacy is an archaic practice, suggesting that change is inevitable.

Claim: Celibacy is too pressuring/difficult.
Evidence: Critics like Elizabeth Abbott argue that suppressing sexual urges warps people, leading to negative outcomes, while the challenge of maintaining celibacy can make the lifestyle difficult (Jimmy O'Brien).

Claim: Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural.
Evidence: Critics claim celibacy is unnatural as all living organisms are meant to reproduce. Also, conflicts between priestly vows of celibacy and the desire for intimacy can lead to mental health issues (Ford).

Claim: Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour.
Evidence: Some believe that priestly celibacy contributed to the sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic Church (Christoph Schnborn, Hans Kng).

Claim: Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests.
Evidence: Celibacy has deterred some from becoming priests as they want to avoid this vow. Also, advocates like Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck support ending celibacy to address the priest shortage."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 2: Plenty of research indicates that healthy marriage positively impacts children and society. And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, it’s possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
    - Evidence 2: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 2: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 2: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..
","Topic: 'We should abandon marriage'

Opposing arguments summary:

Those opposing the abandonment of marriage assert that marriage:

Benefits children: Evidence shows that children raised in intact marriages are more likely to attend college, are healthier, less likely to be abused or engage in delinquent behaviors, and less likely to divorce when they marry themselves.
Holds religious and traditional importance: Marriage can be viewed as a mirror of the Creator's unconditional love and brings joy and contentment to the couple. It is also beneficial for raising children, especially given the increase in mental and behavioral disorders and criminal activity in children raised without a father.
Increases happiness: Research indicates that people who are satisfied with their lives are more likely to get married, and those who are married tend to be happier than those who are not.
Strengthens couple's bond: Married adults have been found to be more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners compared to cohabiting couples.
Provides financial benefits: Marriage has financial advantages like higher standard deductions and tax-deductible health insurance premiums for both spouses."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
    - Evidence 2: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..
    - Evidence 2: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 2: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
","Topic: 'We should abandon marriage'
Supporting arguments summary:

The proponents for abandoning marriage suggest that:

Marriage can harm women: Evidence indicates that the effects of marriage can be worse for women than men, with women often being expected to take on a traditional, subservient role.
Marriages are unstable: Data shows that divorce rates have risen globally since the 1970s, suggesting a level of instability inherent in marriages.
Marriages enforce unfair obligations: Laws and societal norms can force women into subservient roles, with religious texts and legal rules sometimes encouraging this inequality.
Advantages of marriage can be achieved outside it: Monogamous relationships can foster the same emotional intimacy and health benefits that marriage does, without the legal and societal obligations of marriage."

- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 2: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.

    - Evidence 1: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
","Opponents of the motion ""We should abandon the use of school uniform"" structure their argument around five key points.

Self-Expression: They argue that children can express themselves through means other than fashion. Free speech, they assert, does not include the freedom to choose clothing. They reference a study by Andrea Dashiell, where 54% of surveyed eighth graders felt they could express themselves despite a uniform policy.

Bullying Prevention: Proponents cite a study by the Schoolwear Association indicating 83% of teachers believed uniforms could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background. The potential to protect economically disadvantaged students from bullying is also mentioned.

Equality and Unity: They posit uniforms promote equality and unity among students. A study in Texas reported students in uniforms felt a greater sense of belonging to their school community.

Discipline and Focus: They argue uniforms can improve academic performance by reducing distractions and fostering a more serious learning environment. Evidence from the NASSP Bulletin supports this point.

Cost Savings: Lastly, they suggest uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel, citing a national survey of US school leaders and a UK study comparing the cost of school uniforms with regular outfits."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
    - Evidence 2: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
    - Evidence 2: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
    - Evidence 2: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
","In contrast, supporters of the motion argue:

Harm to Learning and Creativity: They believe strict dress codes stifle creativity and make for a dull learning environment, with one student and Tara Maginnis Ph.D. supporting this view.

Damage to Self-Expression: They contend uniforms suppress students' freedom of expression, with development specialist Robyn Silverman discussing how uniforms can negatively affect body image among students.

Cost: They argue the cost of uniforms is prohibitively high, referencing a study by the Children's Society which showed school uniform expenses far exceed what parents deem acceptable.

Discomfort and Sexism: They claim school uniforms are often uncomfortable and can perpetuate sexism. Evidence from a GLSEN study and Laura Bates of The Everyday Sexism Project supports this point.

Increased Conformity and Loss of Individuality: Finally, they argue that uniforms encourage conformity at the expense of individuality, which could hinder an adolescent's transition into adulthood. They cite research emphasizing the importance of self-expression and decision-making skills in preparing children for adulthood."

- claim_1: The death penalty helps the victim/their family.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..
    - Evidence 2: Henry McMaster, JD, Governor of South Carolina, in a May 5, 2021 twitter thread that included a link to the The State article by Emily Bohatch, SC House Passes Bill Bringing Back Electric Chair, Introducing Firing Squad, stated: The S.C House has given second reading to a bill that will restore the state’s ability to carry out the death penalty. We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..

Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
","Debate Summary:

Opponents of the motion ""We should abolish capital punishment"" have presented three core arguments:

They argue that the death penalty offers closure for the victims' families. Citing Leslie Rutledge and Tom Cotton, they point to cases where the guilty party acknowledges their guilt, arguing that capital punishment ends a prolonged period of pain for victims' families. South Carolina's Governor, Henry McMaster, also supports this argument, asserting that the death penalty provides victims' families with justice and closure.

The opponents believe that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes. They highlight how institutions such as the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights maintain that capital punishment has become customary international law in such cases. Furthermore, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described executions as systematic responses to heinous crimes.

They contend that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to prevent crimes. Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd's study points out that each execution results in fewer murders, arguing that capital punishment has a significant deterrent effect. Charles Stimson from the Heritage Foundation also suggests that the death penalty serves as both a general and specific deterrent and provides society with a means of retribution."

- claim_1: State-sanctioned killing is principally wrong.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..
    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
- claim_2: The death penalty harms the disenfranchised.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..

- claim_3: The death penalty irreversible.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
    - Evidence 2: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
","In contrast, supporters of abolishing capital punishment put forward three counter-arguments:

They contend that state-sanctioned killing is fundamentally wrong. They note that the death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner, disproportionately affecting people based on their socioeconomic status and race. They argue that innocent people are too often sentenced to death, pointing out that over 156 people have been released from death row due to proven innocence since 1973.

The supporters argue that the death penalty disproportionately harms the disenfranchised. They reference a 2010 study showing that the median cost of a federal death penalty case is nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case, suggesting that such resources could be better used elsewhere to increase public safety, health, and welfare.

Finally, they argue that the death penalty is irreversible, highlighting that the risk of executing an innocent person is too great. Craig Trocino, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, stated that there is no proven deterrence factor to the death penalty and that states without it consistently have lower murder rates."

","Debate Summary:

Topic: Should we abolish intellectual property rights?

Stance: Opposition to Abolition

Opponents of the abolition of intellectual property rights offer several arguments:

Intellectual property rights incentivize creativity/innovation. The incentive theories view intellectual property as essential for promoting new creative works, as it provides the author with the incentive to create. Without such rights, there's a fear that authors wouldn't produce new works due to lack of economic gain.

Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in new products. Evidence from a joint research project by WIPO and United Nations University showed a positive correlation between strengthening of intellectual property system and economic growth in six Asian countries. Moreover, the Business Software Alliance noted the public's support for rewarding innovators monetarily to encourage more technological advances.

Intellectual property rights protect against theft. Advocates argue that intellectual property, such as movies, music, and television shows, are better preserved with copyright. This aligns with Locke's argument that creators have the right to control what they create.

Owners should be compensated for their innovations. The exclusive rights provided by intellectual property laws allow creators to benefit financially from their creations, thus, creating a monetary incentive to invest in research and development. Plus, IP-intensive industries generate more value per employee than non-IP-intensive ones."

","Debate Summary:

Topic: Should we abolish intellectual property rights?

Stance: Support for Abolition

Those who advocate for the abolition of intellectual property rights make the following points:

Intellectual property hinders improvement of a product/service. Critics argue that intellectual monopolies can harm health and prevent progress, benefiting concentrated interests at the cost of the public. They posit that public interest is harmed by ever-increasing monopolies like copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents.

Intellectual property restricts access to vital information/products. Intellectual property can potentially criminalize users who upload copyrighted content due to poor definition of punishable conduct. Moreover, it disregards the inherent rights of indigenous peoples related to their cultural, spiritual, and historical possessions.

Intellectual property rights are unjust. Roderick T. Long and Edwin Hettinger argue that intellectual property infringes freedom of speech and freedom of the press and that natural rights arguments for intellectual property are weak.

Intellectual property rights stifle creativity/innovation. Historical analysis, as Petra Moser suggests, indicates that strong intellectual property rights may discourage innovation as innovators may worry about infringing upon intellectual property rights in a free culture.

Intellectual property rights are costly. The process of acquiring protection can be expensive, especially for complex products involving various methods, designs, and processes. Moreover, monopolies, including intellectual ones, create many social costs.

Intellectual property rights are ineffective. Critics argue that patents and copyrights protect something that cannot rightfully be held as property, making them inappropriate for regulation of intellectual property law and present a risk to industry and innovation."

- claim_4: Gun ownership promotes self protection.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
    - Evidence 2: Pew Foundation report found that 79% of male gun owners and 80% of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64% of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer..
","The debate topic is 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms'. The opponents and proponents of this topic bring forth different arguments to support their stances.

Opponents of the topic assert four main arguments:

Gun control is ineffective. A Lancet study suggests that most state-level gun control laws do not significantly reduce firearm death rates. Further, a study in Applied Economics Letters found that restrictions on carrying concealed weapons could lead to higher gun-related murders.

Gun ownership is a right. According to a survey, about three-quarters of gun owners view this right as essential to their sense of freedom. Further, prominent political figures like Sen. John McCain have affirmed that the right to bear arms is a constitutional one.

Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting. Data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service shows that a significant number of people use firearms for hunting and sports-shooting activities.

Gun ownership promotes self-protection. A Gallup survey found that a majority of gun owners cite personal safety or protection as the primary reason for owning a firearm. Similarly, a Pew Foundation report found that a significant percentage of male and female gun owners feel safer owning a gun."

Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence. Research suggests that states with higher gun ownership rates experience more mass shootings. Further, a 1993 study found that guns in the home could increase the risk of homicide by family members or acquaintances.

Guns can fall into the wrong hands. Proponents point to incidents like the Sutherland Springs massacre, where a man, legally barred from buying guns, managed to do so and killed 26 people.

Guns lead to accidental deaths. Research shows that people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries in states with more guns. Additionally, victims of unintentional shootings were found to be three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm."

One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
    - Evidence 2: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
","Topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime'

Opponents' Summary:
Opponents of austerity regimes argue that such policies could lead to detrimental outcomes, including limited access to essential services, prolonging recessions, promoting unfairness, causing lower growth, and resulting in reduced job creation. They cite evidence from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and personal testimonies, highlighting the impact of austerity measures on unprotected social sectors and vulnerable populations. Critics also note how austerity policies exacerbated recessions in several European countries, according to economists like Blanchard, Leigh, and Krugman. They contend that austerity measures increase income inequality and poverty, as indicated by IMF studies, and have resulted in slowed growth in OECD countries and decreased job creation in nations with robust employment protection legislation."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
    - Evidence 2: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
    - Evidence 2: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The chancellor, George Osborne, certainly plans more austerity, hoping to achieve a budget surplus and a rapidly declining debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the decade (four years later than he originally predicted)..
    - Evidence 2: The budget deficit was 11% of GDP in 2009-10. It is now about 5.5% and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of UK predicts a surplus by the end of the decade..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
","Topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime'

Supporters' Summary:
Supporters of austerity regimes, on the other hand, contend that such measures can enhance economic performance, bring long-term benefits, increase stability, reduce deficits, and are crucial during economic turmoil. Harvard economist Alberto Alesina's research is often cited, suggesting that spending cuts can lead to economic expansions, and the successful implementation of austerity measures in Greece is frequently mentioned. They also point out that austerity measures, though initially increasing the default premium, can improve the long-term economic performance of the economy. Supporters further argue that austerity regimes can lead to an export-led recovery by compressing domestic demand and expanding exports, as demonstrated in Ireland's case. They also maintain that reducing government spending is essential to manage national deficits and pay debts, as evidenced by the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility predictions. Lastly, historical examples such as the U.S. response to the 1920-21 recession under President Harding illustrate how austerity can effectively respond to economically challenging times."
We should adopt atheism,-1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism discriminates against religious people / violates freedom of religion.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..
    - Evidence 2: The report also criticized the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship; they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'..
- claim_2: People should choose for themselves whether Atheism should be adopted.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, Liddle argues that which option you take, then, God or no God, is a matter of choosing something for which there is no scientific proof either way..
","Opponents' Perspective:

The topic 'We should adopt atheism' is confronted with significant objections. Opponents argue that atheism can potentially violate the freedom of religion and discriminate against religious people. They cite the example of the Albanian Constitution of 1976, which explicitly supported atheistic propaganda while imposing prison sentences for religious activities, indicating a clear discriminatory practice (Evidence 1). Furthermore, they refer to the atheistic ideology permeating the Russian dictatorship, which denounces religion and God as 'lies' (Evidence 2).

Opponents also assert the importance of individual choice in adopting atheism. They reference the principle that freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs should only be subject to limitations deemed necessary in a democratic society for public safety, public order, health, morals, or the protection of others' rights (Evidence 1). They also suggest that the question of believing in God or not, is ultimately a matter of personal choice, given the lack of scientific proof either way (Evidence 2)."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
    - Evidence 2: I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 2: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 2: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
    - Evidence 2: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
","Proponents' Perspective:

Proponents of the topic 'We should adopt atheism' provide arguments suggesting the personal benefits of adopting atheism, potential lack of evidence for God's existence, the immorality inherent in some religions, and the adequacy of science in explaining the Universe.

Proponents argue that atheism frees individuals from the dogmas and controversies that can be found in religious texts. They point out that without religion, people won't have to worry about divine judgement or living according to strict religious moral codes (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 1). They also insist that atheism should be the default position given the lack of concrete evidence for God's existence. They highlight that an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God would naturally make his presence known, which seems not to be the case (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 2).

Furthermore, proponents contend that some religions can encourage immoral behavior, citing teachings about slavery in the Bible and immoral acts committed in the name of Christianity and Islam (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 3). Finally, they argue that science provides a more satisfying and verifiable explanation of the Universe than religion, alluding to the views of Nobel laureate Stephen Weinberg and renowned biologist Richard Dawkins (Evidence 1 & 2 for Claim 4)."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
    - Evidence 2: Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
- claim_4: Libertarianism removes essential laws/infrastructure/government services.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..
    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
- claim_5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
    - Evidence 2: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
","Opponents of the motion ""We should adopt libertarianism"" present five main claims:

Claim 1 posits that libertarianism is harmful to economic growth. They highlight that proponents of libertarianism often ignore market failures and propose laissez-faire capitalism. Evidence includes criticism that laissez-faire capitalism leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, as well as a statement from Adam Smith that the system is complex and administered without conscious purpose.

Claim 2 argues that libertarianism negatively affects minorities and the disadvantaged. Philosopher James P. Sterba suggests that the non-interference stance of libertarianism disproportionately impacts the poor, who should morally have the right to take from the surplus possessions of the rich to meet basic needs.

Claim 3 asserts that libertarianism is unjust and inequitable. Critics argue that markets can fail to meet social needs and result in unequal outcomes, as exemplified by the rise in income inequality in most OECD countries despite neoliberal policies.

Claim 4 argues that libertarianism eliminates necessary laws, infrastructure, and government services, citing environmental degradation and natural resource depletion due to lack of regulation as examples.

Finally, claim 5 emphasizes the role of government in protecting citizen rights, such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly, and in combating climate change."

Opponents of the Ban

Cloning for Organ Replication: Opponents argue that cloning can advance medical research and enhance the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's (Journal of the American Medical Association). Moreover, cloning can reduce the reliance on animal testing by creating human cells and tissues for research (National Institutes of Health).

Assisting Reproduction: Opponents argue that cloning can help those unable to have children naturally. Cloning can create a child free of genetic diseases present in parents (New England Journal of Medicine), or create a child genetically related to one of the parents, assisting couples struggling with infertility (Journal of Medical Ethics).

Promotion of Health: Opponents argue that cloning can be used to study and develop new treatments for conditions like infertility (Fertility and Sterility journal) and aging (Aging Cell journal).

Advancement of Science/Research: Cloning can be used to study extinct species and evolutionary processes (Journal of Evolutionary Biology). Also, it can produce genetically modified organisms for applications such as new medicines or improved agricultural production (Nature Biotechnology journal)."

Topic: 'We should ban human cloning'

Supporters of the Ban

Limited Understanding: Supporters argue that cloning is not well understood, with Leon Kass warning about societal implications of treating children as ""pure projects of our will"". The potential for creating and enslaving ""monsters"" such as human clones is also mentioned.

Ethical and Religious Concerns: Supporters contend that cloning is unethical, with countries like Germany, France, and the United States proposing a ban on all forms of human cloning at the United Nations General Assembly in 2001. It's seen as unethical due to its complexities and low success rate.

Unnatural Process: Cloning is seen as unnatural because it disrupts the familial order by removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship (Richard McCormick, S.J.). The Christian Coalition of America also considers human cloning an aberration.

Safety Concerns: Supporters of the ban highlight the potential for abuse of cloning technology (Council of Europe, 2008), and the health risks to cloned animals, including genetic abnormalities and premature death (Nature Reviews Genetics, 2003)."

Opponents' Stance:

Financial Benefit: Opponents argue that private military companies (PMCs) are cost-effective, offering a streamlined decision-making process that reduces bureaucratic processes, according to a 2010 study in International Affairs, and the Heritage Foundation suggests they offer flexibility in hiring and deployment, allowing rapid response to changing circumstances.

Training and Equipment: PMCs provide well-trained personnel and can respond quickly in a crisis, as reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2007. The Congressional Research Service in 2009 noted that PMCs offer specialized training programs that allow them to stay updated with the latest tactics and techniques.

Supplementing Regular Armies: According to the RAND Corporation in 2013, PMCs can perform non-core tasks such as security and support, thereby freeing regular army personnel for their primary missions. The Senate Armed Services Committee in 2007 also found that PMCs can carry out sensitive missions, like covert operations.

Increase Safety: A 2010 Heritage Foundation report suggests that PMCs can improve safety by offering support services such as logistics and communications. Additionally, RAND Corporation (2013) found that PMCs often invest in advanced technology, enhancing safety and effectiveness in operations."

","Debate Summary:

Topic: We should ban private military companies

Supporters' Stance:

Ethical Violations: Supporters of the ban argue that PMCs are prone to ethical violations and crimes, with the Congressional Research Service reporting unlawful killings by PMCs in 2010, and the Journal of Business Ethics highlighting potential conflicts of interest in 2008.

Lack of Professionalism: Amnesty International in 2009 revealed that PMCs have been accused of hiring poorly trained personnel, decreasing operational professionalism. The Congressional Research Service (2009) adds that limited transparency around PMC operations further impedes professionalism.

Questionable Loyalty: A 2007 Human Rights Watch report indicates that the opaque nature of PMCs can lead to actions against the hiring country's best interest. The Journal of Business Ethics (2008) suggests a potential conflict of interest when serving clients and broader societal interests, leading to trust issues.

Profit-driven: A 2006 report by the International Peace Institute claimed that unregulated PMCs often prioritize profit over other considerations. The Project on Government Oversight echoed this concern in 2008, noting the difficulty in monitoring profit-driven activities due to limited transparency.

Escalating Conflict: The Congressional Research Service in 2009 and Amnesty International in 2009 both suggest that PMCs may escalate and prolong conflicts, due to the lack of accountability and increased militarization they introduce."

","Debate Summary:

Topic: 'We should ban the use of child actors'
Opponents of the ban put forth several strong arguments. They propose that:

Acting may be a child's dream. The American Psychological Association (2010) and the Drama Teachers Association of America (2011) have both presented reports indicating that acting can help children express their emotions and pursue a career in performing arts, given their natural talent.

Child performers are necessary for certain roles. The Actors Equity Association's report (2014) and a study in the Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism (2016) suggest that child actors make productions more engaging and aid in the development of crucial character arcs.

Child performers shouldn't be banned as long as there is proper supervision and regulation, ensuring compliance with child labor laws and secure entertainment work permits.

Parents have the right to decide for their children. Citing reports from the American Academy of Pediatrics (2018) and the United Nations (2015), opponents assert that parents' cultural, religious, and personal values guide their decision-making and should be respected and protected."

A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
    - Evidence 2: In 1997, he published a pseudo-autobiographical novel called The Mao Game about a fifteen-year-old child star attempting to cope with heroin addiction, memories of past sexual abuse, and the impending death of his grandmother, who has been diagnosed with cancer..
","Debate Summary:

Topic: 'We should ban the use of child actors'
On the other hand, supporters of the ban argue:

Being a performer may harm the child's education. According to the Journal of Adolescence (2018) and the American Psychological Association (2017), child actors may experience long-term negative effects on their personal, professional, and academic lives due to high stress levels.

Child performers are at risk of exploitation. Evidence from the Journal of Youth and Adolescence (2014) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (2016) suggests that child actors may face human trafficking risks, physical harm, and a lack of proper care and support.

Child performers may lose their childhood. Studies have shown that child actors might lose their innocence due to exposure to adult themes and the intense pressure of the entertainment industry (Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 2014; National Child Traumatic Stress Network, 2010).

Child performers may experience high levels of pressure leading to burnout and mental health issues like depression and anxiety (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016; Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 2014).

Child performers tend to develop problems later in life, such as identity crises and difficulty adjusting to life outside the industry, as evidenced by the struggles of former child actor Herbert. The pressures of child acting can lead to severe issues, such as addiction and mental health disorders, later in life."

    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..
","Topic: We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp
Opposing Stance:

Argument 1:
Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.

Evidence: A report by the director of the National Intelligence indicated that 17.5% of former Gitmo detainees transferred to other countries were confirmed to reengage in terrorist or insurgent activities. Moreover, a definition of ""high-value enemy combatant"" highlights the potential threat these individuals pose if released.
Argument 2:
The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is better for prisoners than the alternatives.

Evidence: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is secure, provides maximum security to prevent escape, offers various levels of confinement based on compliance, and provides world-class medical care. It complies with the Geneva Convention and offers humane treatment, exceeding standards of maximum-security prisons worldwide.
Argument 3:

    - Evidence 2: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..

Arguments against ending affirmative action:

Affirmative action boosts diversity: The case of Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin highlighted the benefit Asian students receive from exposure to a diverse student body, underscoring the importance of diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action.
Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past: Historian Roger Wilkins' analysis underscores the need for affirmative action as a means to compensate for years of slavery and legalized discrimination faced by the Black community, a reality distinct from the experiences of other immigrant groups.
Affirmative action reduces discrimination: The example of Wesolowski's support for affirmative action for Saskatoon Catholic teachers and Johnson v.

Affirmative action is not just: The case against Harvard University illustrates how race-based admission practices may unjustly impact high-performing students, and critiques suggest that affirmative action may prioritize appearances over ensuring equal opportunities.
Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice: Affirmative action, as critiqued by the lawsuit against Harvard and Hardin's book, can inadvertently perpetuate racial prejudice.
Affirmative action reduces quality: Data from the University of Texas and graduation rates from higher education indicate that affirmative action might not be equipping minority students with the necessary tools to succeed, leading to disparities in academic performance and graduation rates."

","Summary of Debate:

Topic: 'We should end mandatory retirement'

Supporters' Argument:

Supporters of the motion believe that mandatory retirement has several negative impacts. Their arguments include the following points:

Decreases institutional knowledge: They reference commercial airline pilots in the US and successful businessman Greene's employment policies as examples of where mandatory retirement might lead to loss of experience and institutional knowledge.

Harms the economy: Evidence from the International Monetary Fund (2019) and the International Labour Organization (2012) shows that mandatory retirement can limit labor market flexibility and lead to inefficient use of human capital.

Discriminatory: The World Economic Forum (2016) and Harvard Business Review (2017) studies suggest that mandatory retirement promotes intergenerational inequity and can decrease older workers' sense of purpose.

Reduces quality of life for retirees: Research published in The Gerontologist and the Journal of Gerontology suggests that mandatory retirement can lead to decreased social connections, increased feelings of loneliness, and decreased psychological well-being.

Retirement should be at will: They suggest, based on studies by the World Economic Forum (2016) and the American Association of Retired Persons (2010), that allowing people to retire when they are ready can reduce the risk of poverty in old age and supports active aging."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,-1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons is essential for protection and deterrence.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..
","Debate Summary:

Opponents of the motion ""We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons"" argue that nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. They put forth the principle of deterrence as a key strategy in maintaining peace, having done so for nearly seven decades (Evidence 1). To further substantiate this claim, they draw attention to the conflict in Ukraine, asserting that the invasion did not indicate the failure of nuclear deterrence, but instead illustrated the importance of nuclear protection. In this example, the opponents argue that the boundaries set by nuclear deterrence, as seen with NATO and Russia, prevent major, frontal military attacks (Evidence 2)."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
    - Evidence 2: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
    - Evidence 2: David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack. Additionally, the fact that it happened so recently highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago..
","Debate Summary:

On the other hand, advocates for the abolition of nuclear weapons propose two main arguments. The first argument emphasizes the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands. They highlight concerns of theft or loss of nuclear materials which are continually being developed and may not always be recoverable (Evidence 1). They further argue that even those entrusted with nuclear weapons, like presidents, can pose a risk due to unforeseen personal crises or mental health issues (Evidence 2).

Their second argument focuses on the potential of nuclear weapons to provoke or escalate disastrous military action. Using historical events like the Cuban missile crisis, they argue that escalating tensions significantly increase the likelihood of unfortunate incidents leading to large-scale problems (Evidence 1). They also draw attention to a more recent event where contact was lost with 50 missiles, demonstrating that even current safeguards may not prevent accidental launches or false alarms, which highlights the persistent risks associated with nuclear weapons (Evidence 2)."
We should fight urbanization,-1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight urbanization', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..
    - Evidence 2: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
- claim_2: Urbanization benefits the economy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
    - Evidence 2: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
","Summary of the Opposition to 'We should fight urbanization':

Opponents of fighting urbanization present a strong case based on the potential opportunities and benefits that urbanization brings to individuals, the economy, and even the environment. They argue that cities offer numerous opportunities, using examples such as Japan's urbanization during the 20th century that provided better job prospects and education. Further evidence comes from Sihanoukville, where urbanization is expected to create economic opportunities leading to increased migration.

The second claim focuses on urbanization's potential for economic growth. This argument emphasizes that even overurbanization can result in positives such as more efficient economics due to scale, technological advancements, and increased occupational mobility. As proof, they cite the privatization of agriculture in China and the influx of international investment.

The last claim addresses environmental benefits. Despite the perceived strain urbanization puts on the environment, opponents argue that it drives green technology innovation and ultimately contributes to the green economy. Furthermore, they present the idea that urban productivity significantly exceeds that of rural areas, leading to the production of the same output with fewer resources, hence reducing the ecological footprint."

- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:

    - Evidence 2: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
","Summary of the Support for 'We should fight urbanization':

Supporters of the motion believe that urbanization has significant drawbacks and should therefore be fought. They argue that restricting migration could economically and socially benefit people in rural areas. This is supported by evidence from India, where protecting natural resources effectively prevented rural-urban migration. They also refer to Venezuela's urbanization, which led to neglect and abandonment of rural areas, making the country a net food importer despite its rich arable lands.

The second argument put forth states that urbanization leads to increased crime rates. They back this up by referencing the rise in crime rates during the industrialization era and the increase in criminal activities in rapidly urbanizing areas like Bopal & Ghuma.

Supporters also claim that urbanization negatively impacts the environment, causing increased degradation of marine environments due to coastal development and contaminating water quality due to the increase in metals and organic contaminants.

Lastly, supporters argue that urbanization puts a significant strain on city resources, leading to overpopulation, inadequate housing, and sanitary facilities, and limited access to educational facilities. They use UNESCO reports and case studies of fast urbanization processes leading to the formation of irregular neighborhoods to substantiate this claim."

    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience.

- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
","Topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting'

Stance 1: Opposition to compulsory voting

The opposition argues that compulsory voting infringes on a citizen's right not to vote, undermines the validity of abstention, and may result in uninformed voting.

Claim 1: Abstaining from a vote also reflects personal preferences.

Evidence: Herbert Spencer's critique of Blackstone's doctrine that any form of participation, including abstention, is considered consent to the winning candidate's rule. Abstention can indicate ambivalence, mild disapproval, political expedience, or a feeling of being inadequately informed.

Claim 2: Citizens have a right not to vote.

Evidence: Minchin, a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, argued that compulsory voting breaches civil liberties. This stance asserts that citizens should have the choice to vote, and enforcing this might lead down a slippery slope towards totalitarianism.

Claim 3: Compulsory voting can lead to uninformed or random voting.

Evidence: It is argued that compulsory voting might lead to votes from individuals who are uninformed or indifferent to the election outcome, which can dampen the majority's voice and skew election results. Uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of misleading advertising and sensational campaigning tactics."

- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 2: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 2: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..
","Topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting'

Stance 2: Support for compulsory voting

Supporters of compulsory voting argue that it increases representation, promotes political interest, and upholds the civic duty to vote.

Claim 1: Compulsory voting increases representation.

Evidence: Mandatory voting obliges candidates to address all voters, preventing political skewing towards the affluent or well-educated demographic, as often happens in voluntary voting systems like in the U.S. Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. argue that boosting turnout, especially among underrepresented groups, enhances justice and representation.

Claim 2: Compulsory voting incites greater interest in politics.

Evidence: With compulsory voting, candidates secure a majority of the people's votes, increasing the elected representative's legitimacy. Compulsory voting also enhances political education, as citizens tend to pay more attention to politics when they know they have to vote.

Claim 3: Citizens have an obligation to vote.

Evidence: The Thai constitution enshrines voting as a citizen's duty. Echoing this sentiment, Johnson highlights the historical struggles to secure voting rights, suggesting that eligible voters who don't participate are taking this hard-won right for granted."
We should legalize cannabis,-1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cannabis harms the body.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, the Board representative is quoted as having said that we might end up in the next 10 or 20 years with our psychiatric hospitals filled with people who have problems with cannabis, and that a recent study by the British Lung Foundation found smoking three cannabis joints caused the same damage to the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes..
    - Evidence 2: Dutch research has however shown that an increase of THC content also increase the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among younger or inexperienced cannabis smokers, who do not adapt their smoking-style to the higher THC content..
- claim_2: Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..
    - Evidence 2: In a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers are noticing a pattern that suggests alcohol might not be the only culprit of impaired driving. Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..

There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..
    - Evidence 2: Alaska's experiment with legalization in the 1970s led to the state's teens using marijuana at more than twice the rate of other youths nationally. This led Alaska's residents to vote to re-criminalize marijuana in 1990..
","Topic: 'We should legalize cannabis'

Summary of Opponent's Stance:

Opponents of cannabis legalization present four main arguments.

First, they claim that cannabis is harmful to the body. They assert that heavy cannabis usage can lead to significant lung damage, as per the British Lung Foundation's research. Furthermore, Dutch research suggests that increased THC content in cannabis can lead to impaired psychomotor skills, especially in younger or inexperienced users.

The second argument posits that cannabis use contributes to accidents, specifically vehicular crashes. Multiple studies, including one published in the American Journal of Public Health, show that the rate of fatal crashes involving cannabis and alcohol consumption has more than doubled over the past two decades.

Third, opponents see cannabis as a gateway to harder drugs and potential addiction. They cite a study involving same-sex twins that revealed a higher probability of one twin moving on to harder drugs if they smoked cannabis before age 17.

Lastly, they argue that legalizing cannabis could lead to increased usage among underage teenagers. They cite historical data from Alaska, where marijuana legalization resulted in the state's teens using cannabis at double the national rate, eventually leading residents to vote for re-criminalization of cannabis in 1990."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
    - Evidence 2: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..

    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
- claim_4: If cannabis was legalized it could be regulated.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..
    - Evidence 2: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
- claim_5: Legalizing cannabis will reduce black-market/criminal activity.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
    - Evidence 2: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
","Topic: 'We should legalize cannabis'

Summary of Supporters' Stance:

Supporters of cannabis legalization also present five key arguments.

First, they posit that legal substances, like alcohol and tobacco, pose even greater health risks than cannabis. They argue that occasional use of certain illicit drugs, including cannabis, may not lead to significant health or social problems, unlike persistent alcohol or tobacco usage.

Second, they suggest that legalizing cannabis could bring significant financial benefits. One study estimates that California saved almost one billion dollars between 1976 and 1988 due to decriminalization of cannabis.

Third, supporters argue that cannabis can have therapeutic benefits. They claim that the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis is inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which suggests that cannabis does have medical benefits.

Fourth, they contend that legalization could lead to effective regulation. They argue that controlled supply and application of drug laws can lead to selective social control, potentially reducing use among vulnerable demographics.

Finally, they propose that legalization would reduce black-market activities and associated criminal behavior. They cite a study by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy, which found that drug law enforcement tends to increase drug-related violence, and therefore alternative models, such as legalization, might be necessary. They also suggest that decriminalization could drastically reduce crime and improve public health."

","Topic: 'We should legalize prostitution'

Opponents' Stance:

The opponents of the legalization of prostitution argue that it may lead to negative consequences including increased STDs, immoral behavior, and violence against women.

Legalizing prostitution can lead to a rise in sexually transmitted diseases. Studies from developing countries like Kenya reveal that prostitution often acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general populace. Additionally, the process of registering prostitutes doesn't adequately address the health risks of unregistered sex workers, hence making the state complicit in the spread of such diseases.

The legalization of sex work may foster immoral behaviors such as pimping, organized crime, and human trafficking. Research conducted by Maxwell (2000) and corroborated by other studies shows a significant correlation between prostitution, drug abuse, and involvement in non-drug related crimes. Furthermore, reports from Dutch councilors, Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, underscore the increase in organized crime and violence in the industry after legalization.

Prostitution legalization might increase violence against women. Research by Giobbe (1993) shows similar behavioral patterns between pimps and batterers, involving social isolation, intimidation, and severe physical violence. Surveys conducted on sex workers in Leeds, Glasgow, and Edinburgh show a significant percentage of sex workers experiencing violence while at work."

","Topic: 'We should legalize prostitution'

Supporters' Stance:

Supporters of the legalization of prostitution argue that it can lead to economic growth, improved conditions for sex workers, industry regulation, and safety for the women involved.

The legalization of sex work can boost the economy. Historical examples such as Seattle's city founder, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, show that regulated prostitution can be a functional part of an economy.

Legalizing prostitution can increase benefits for sex workers, such as healthcare, safe sex practices, and the possibility of unionization. The Ministry of Justice has previously considered legalizing prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income, while ethnographical research from the University of Porto supports this move to improve the condition of women in the industry.

Legalization allows for regulation of the profession. Advocates, such as Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman, argue that acknowledging and legalizing prostitution can provide safer, regulated, and revenue-generating sex work. Dutch citizens overwhelmingly support this view, considering prostitution as a valid occupation.

Legalized sex work can make the profession safer for women. Studies from China and New Zealand reveal that intervention projects promoting safe sex behaviors have had positive effects on the health and safety of sex workers.

Legalization respects individual autonomy and validates sex work as a personal choice over one's body. Mariska Majoor, a former sex worker, argues that prostitution is a valid profession and a way of making money. This perspective is backed by a 2009 study which shows that sex work has become normalized among the surveyed prostitutes."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
    - Evidence 2: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
    - Evidence 2: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
    - Evidence 2: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
","Opposition's Stance: 'We should not legalize sex selection'

The opponents of legalizing sex selection base their argument on three central claims.

Firstly, they claim that sex selection can exacerbate gender imbalances. As evidence, they cite the substantial gender disparities in certain regions around the globe, such as India and China, where the preference for sons over daughters has led to a distorted male-to-female ratio. This is underscored by statistics that indicate 25% more male births than female births in some areas since the 1990s, reflecting persistent discrimination against females.

Secondly, they argue that sex selection only reaffirms gender biases and stereotypes. The act of parents playing ""God"" and deliberately choosing their child's gender breaks the natural law of conception, according to the opposition. They also reject the argument for 'family balancing' as a suitable use of sex selection, arguing that it often harbors sexist motivations and promotes consumerist tendencies in family creation.

Thirdly, they express concerns that sex selection could lead to an increase in abortions and even infanticide. They cite evidence indicating that son preference is correlated with repeat abortions, while highlighting the case of two doctors in Britain who were not prosecuted despite agreeing to perform a sex-selective abortion."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt4,top2_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 2: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 2: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..
","Supporters' Stance: 'We should legalize sex selection'

Supporters of sex selection legalization, on the other hand, present several counterarguments.

First, they argue that parents should have the freedom to select their child's sex. This freedom, they believe, can help parents plan their families more effectively, ensuring they are capable of providing proper nutrition and education. Additionally, it allows them to avoid passing gender-specific diseases onto their offspring.

Secondly, supporters suggest that sex selection aids in family planning. Particularly in regions where family size is limited, like China, the ability to select a child's gender gives parents the opportunity to have the gender of child they desire without exceeding population limits.

Thirdly, advocates believe sex selection can foster a happier, more complete family. The opportunity to have a child of a desired gender can enhance familial love and satisfaction. Moreover, it can provide solace for parents who have lost a child, giving them the option to have another child of the same gender.

Fourthly, supporters maintain that sex selection can help prevent diseases. With technologies such as Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD), embryos can be selected based on health factors, reducing the likelihood of genetic disorders and increasing chances of successful pregnancy.

Lastly, supporters argue that legalizing sex selection could actually prevent abortions or infanticide. They refer to horrific instances of gendercide, the killing of a newborn due to their gender, as justification. With the ability to select their child's gender, parents could avoid finding themselves with an undesired gender and resorting to such tragic outcomes."

- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
    - Evidence 2: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
    - Evidence 2: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 2: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 2: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..

    - Evidence 1: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..

    - Evidence 2: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
","Topic: Prohibition of Women in Combat

Opponents of this prohibition believe in equality between men and women and argue that women are an asset in combat. They point to evidence of women's increasing participation in economic activities and their lower rates of disciplinary problems as indicators of their potential effectiveness in combat roles. Additionally, they argue that women possess unique skills and strategies beneficial to combat situations, citing historical examples like the Soviet Army during WWII and women serving as Special Operations Executive agents. They also propose that women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat, using the example of Maria Bochkareva's WomenÕs Battalion of Death in WWI and the historical service of women in the U.S. military.

They further argue that women should have the choice to serve in combat if they wish to do so, citing studies like the one conducted by the British Ministry of Defense in 2010 that found women performed on par with men. They also posit that women should be accepted into combat roles if they can pass the required tests, advocating for gender-free fitness standards like those introduced by the Army, where selection is based on ability, not gender."

Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..

Claim 1 is that men are better suited to combat roles than women. This is supported by evidence like a Marine Corps study indicating all-male units were faster, more lethal, and could evacuate quicker than integrated units.

Claim 2 posits that women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers. This is bolstered by data from the US Army, which suggests that women overwhelmingly fail to keep up with their male counterparts in physical tests.

Claim 3 suggests that women in combat can be a distraction or harm the military's function. Evidence shows potential negative impacts on unit cohesion and operational effectiveness from relationships formed between men and women on extended overseas tours.

Claim 4 states that women should serve in safer roles. This is substantiated by statistics like the IDF's 2014 data showing that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions.

The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
    - Evidence 2: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
    - Evidence 2: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..
    - Evidence 2: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..

Topic: We should subsidize space exploration

Against

The opponents of the topic claim that:

Space exploration can be carried by the private sector. They cite recent examples of private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic partnering with NASA to launch humans and payloads into space. They also mention that NASA is encouraging the private sector to develop next-generation habitats, suggesting that private companies could be the future of space exploration.

Space exploration is expensive. The opponents mention the annual budget of space agencies that cost billions of dollars. They argue that the return on this investment, in terms of technological advancements, does not justify the enormous costs.

Space exploration is ineffective. They point out the environmental impact of space travel, with each launch producing hundreds of tons of carbon dioxide. Moreover, they argue that missions beyond Earth's orbit have limited direct benefits to life on our planet.

There are issues more important to fund than space exploration. Opponents argue that the billions of dollars spent on space exploration could instead be allocated to critical issues like education, healthcare, combating climate change, or researching cures for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's."

    - Evidence 1: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..

In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
    - Evidence 2: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
    - Evidence 2: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..

","Summary of the Debate

Topic: Should We Subsidize Vocational Education?

Opponents' Stance and Arguments:

The opponents of subsidizing vocational education put forward several reasons:

Diversion of resources: They argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes. The American Federation of Teachers in 2019 found that many vocational programs may not provide the skills and knowledge required for the 21st-century workforce, thereby offering limited economic benefits.

Costly investment: They also contend that subsidizing vocational education is expensive, potentially draining resources from other crucial areas like financial aid, student support services, and research and development, as suggested by a 2019 report from the National Skills Coalition.

Profession influx: Further, they assert that subsidies lead to an influx in vocational fields. A study analyzing the effects of subsidies in Germany showed an increase in vocational enrollment and corresponding decline in academic programs, leading to a potential oversaturation in certain vocational professions.

Career progression limitations: Finally, opponents argue that vocational education is not a good career choice due to limitations in advancement opportunities. A 2019 report from the American Federation of Teachers found that many vocational programs do not provide pathways for career advancement, making it challenging for workers to ascend the career ladder."

Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: That assisted suicide might secure human dignity is a very popular idea. One of the most prominent organizations for assisted suicide in Europe is called “Dignitas”; American laws regulating assisted suicide are called “Death with Dignity Acts” (e.g., the “Washington Death with Dignity Act”); and numerous academic defenders of assisted suicide use the phrase “death with dignity” as a title or starting point for their argumentation. Apparently, the concept of dignity suits the intuitions very well that motivate people to fight for the legalization of physician-assisted death..
    - Evidence 2: In 1992, Kevorkian himself wrote that it is always necessary to consult a psychiatrist when performing assisted suicides because a person's 'mental state is .. of paramount importance.'.
    - Evidence 3: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 4: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: .   They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 5: A qualitative study using narrative interviews was conducted throughout the UK. Results shows that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most people. Those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a right. Some had multiple reasons, including pain and anticipated pain, fear of indignity, loss of control and cognitive impairment. Those who did not want to be a burden also had other reasons for wanting euthanasia. Suicide was contemplated by a few, who would have preferred a change in the law to allow them to end their lives with medical help and in the company of family or friends..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient..
    - Evidence 2: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 3: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People should have the freedom to choose to end their life.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with 'active euthanasia' when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important..
    - Evidence 2: In 2002, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician-assisted suicide. This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances..
    - Evidence 3: The use of Advanced Decisions can help significantly but they also believe that if a right to an Assisted Death is available then the very knowledge of this fact can alleviate many of the worries an individual might have..
    - Evidence 4: Those who witness others die are 'particularly convinced' that the law should be changed to allow assisted death..
    - Evidence 5: The plaintiffs believe that every Canadian should have the choice to have what they consider to be a good death, including the option of a medically assisted death for seriously and incurably ill, mentally competent adults..
- claim_4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A September 2010 Irish Times poll showed that a majority, 57% of adults, believed that doctor-assisted suicide should be legal for terminally ill patients who request it..
    - Evidence 2: In an article published mid-2009, Pratchett stated that he wished to die by assisted suicide (although he disliked that term) before his disease progressed to a critical point..
    - Evidence 3: Drawing on the various ethical, medical and legal considerations as well as on the experiences of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, he argues that on some occasions not only passive euthanasia may be allowed but also physician-assisted suicide..
    - Evidence 4: Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned..
    - Evidence 5: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
","Opponents of the proposition argue against criminalizing assisted suicide, framing it as a matter of dignity, personal choice, and compassion. They assert that the dignity of an individual can be upheld through assisted suicide. This argument is supported by the fact that many organizations and laws related to assisted suicide incorporate the word 'dignity' reflecting a shared understanding of the act as a possible expression of personal autonomy at the end of life. They also cite statements from notable figures like Jack Kevorkian and advocacy groups like Dignity in Dying to corroborate their viewpoint. Additionally, a qualitative study from the UK lends weight to this claim, revealing strong public support for legalizing assisted suicide based on the desire to avoid pain, loss of control, and cognitive impairment. The opponents further argue that assisted suicide reduces suffering, with evidence from New Mexico's judicial system and Dutch law underlining the potential legality of the act under certain conditions. They highlight reports showing that the availability of assisted suicide can offer peace of mind, even if patients ultimately choose a natural death. Asserting that people should have the right to choose their end, opponents draw on examples of legal frameworks such as in the Netherlands and the use of Advanced Decisions to substantiate their claim. A desire for a 'good death' is presented as a valid choice for seriously and incurably ill adults, providing a way for them to maintain control over their fate. Lastly, opponents claim that terminally ill individuals stand to benefit from assisted suicide. Poll data from Ireland and personal accounts from public figures like Terry Pratchett support this argument. This claim is also backed by philosophical and ethical considerations, suggesting that when pain or suffering becomes unbearable, death can be a preferable alternative."

    - Evidence 1: As of 2014 assisted suicide remains illegal in Ireland..
    - Evidence 2: The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment..
    - Evidence 3: In 1997, in the cases of Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it..
    - Evidence 4: In 1994, a suit was filed in New York claiming that the anti-assisted suicide statute was a violation of equal protection and liberty guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment. This claim was rejected by the District Court on the basis that there is no right to assisted suicide given by the U.S. Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out..
- claim_5: People who are ill do not have clear judgement and are in need of help.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: As Emanuel said, 'The Netherlands studies fail to demonstrate that permitting physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia will not lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of children, the demented, the mentally ill, the old, and others.'.
    - Evidence 2: As applied to the euthanasia debate, the slippery slope argument claims that the acceptance of certain practices, such as physician-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia, will invariably lead to the acceptance or practice of concepts which are currently deemed unacceptable, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Supporters of the proposition argue that assisted suicide should be considered a criminal offense due to ethical and medical concerns. They claim that assisted suicide can enable individuals to exploit someone else’s death for personal benefit, with evidence derived from certain regulations requiring a long-term doctor-patient relationship and permanent residency to limit potential misuse. The supporters emphasize the potential for recovery among patients, arguing that considerations like depression or worry about being a burden should not justify assisted suicide. They argue that these might be signs that more could be done to help the patient, implying that the medical community should focus more on healing rather than hastening death. They contend that assisted suicide violates the doctor's role as a healer, a perspective voiced by medical professionals like Dr. Lynda Young. Legal precedents from New York also echo this argument, reinforcing the idea that a doctor's purpose is to preserve life rather than end it. Supporters claim that individuals do not have the right to self-harm or harm others, backed by Irish laws and U.S. court rulings against the constitutional right to assisted suicide. The New Zealand Medical Association's stance against voluntary euthanasia is also mentioned as evidence of professional ethical opposition to the practice. Lastly, they posit that individuals suffering from illness may not have clear judgment, asserting the need for greater assistance and care. They suggest that allowing assisted suicide could potentially lead to the nonvoluntary euthanasia of vulnerable individuals, indicating a slippery slope argument. The idea here is that legalizing assisted suicide could incrementally lead to more extreme practices, such as non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia, which are currently deemed unacceptable."
Homeschooling should be banned,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its opponents argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him 'a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost'..
    - Evidence 2: According to recent research, mainstream schools are failing to meet the requirements of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). Indeed, unhappiness at school is the reason why many parents decide to home educate their children..
    - Evidence 3: “Differentiation is what homeschooling is all about,” Sherry Bushnell told me. She and herhusband founded the National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network, an internationalorganization that supports parents who educate special-needs children at home. They homeschool their sonJordan, a 13-year-old boy with Down's syndrome, along with his nine siblings..
    - Evidence 4: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
    - Evidence 5: The efficiency of homeschooling – and the fact that you don’t have to follow the national curriculum or the typical timings of a school day – leaves you with time to spend broadening your child’s learning. You can make time for play, projects, real experiments, and the arts. Real-life skill building – including cooking, cleaning, volunteering, and learning to budget – could form a part of your school day. You could also choose to learn in different places, like museums, parks, and science centres..

","Opponents of banning homeschooling offer multiple arguments to support their stance. Firstly, they highlight that homeschooling is often the most suitable option for catering to the unique needs of exceptional, religious, ill, or disabled students (Claim 1). For example, Eastern York Schools and Lebanon School District offer services such as special education, combined purchasing, and instructional technology to homeschooled students. Additionally, homeschooling can benefit families living in remote locations, or those pursuing unusual lifestyles, like families of young athletes or actors. Secondly, opponents argue that homeschooling can be tailored to a child's pace and individual needs (Claim 2). They note that homeschooling allowed Ryan Gosling, a famous actor, to maintain his sense of autonomy. Nelson pointed out the benefits of personalized education, stating that it boosts children's engagement and helps them discover their strengths. Homeschooling also allows children to learn real-life skills and experience different environments, such as museums or science centers. The third argument concerns the issues with mainstream schools, such as violence and bullying (Claim 3). Homeschoolers often choose this path to protect their children from these problems and to create a more personalized learning environment. Opponents also assert that parents should have the freedom to choose their children's education (Claim 4). They cite Rep. Franklin, an opponent of public schools, who stated that homeschooling and private schooling are better alternatives. Homeschooling allows parents to be more involved in their children's education progress and explore their own family's culture without the constraints of government systems. Finally, they argue that the home environment is an excellent learning platform (Claim 5). They note that home-educated students tend to be more mature and have broader socialization experiences, offering more active learning environments."
Homeschooling should be banned,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Homeschooling should be banned', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Homeschools cannot be regulated/standardized.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Unschooling contrasts with other forms of home education in that the student's education is not directed by a teacher and curriculum..
    - Evidence 2: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 3: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 4: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although we acknowledged in the advantages section that homeschooled children do still develop socially, they naturally lose some interaction by spending more time at home. They may be out of touch with their peers, have fewer friends, and have less experience interacting with people from different backgrounds. Their view of the world could be very narrow and biased. In the worst cases, they could be brought up to be intolerant and misinformed, with little knowledge of general societal values. This could disadvantage them in the future..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..

    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 3: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse..
    - Evidence 2: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 3: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 4: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Supporters of banning homeschooling posit that homeschools cannot be adequately regulated or standardized (Claim 1). For instance, they mention the case of Vyckie Garrison, who couldn't provide a quality education for her children due to the lack of regulation. Furthermore, they suggest that without oversight and regulation, there's potential for child abuse and educational neglect. The second argument presented is that mainstream schools are essential for developing social skills (Claim 2). They suggest that homeschooling could lead to children being out of touch with their peers and having less exposure to diverse backgrounds. They reference a 20-year study, which showed a correlation between a child's social skills and their future success. The third argument asserts that mainstream schools often offer a higher quality of education (Claim 3). Supporters reference the European Court of Human Rights upholding the German ban on homeschooling, stating that education requires state regulation. They also mention that public school teachers are often more experienced and equipped to teach. The fourth claim suggests that parents are not necessarily qualified to teach (Claim 4). They argue that homeschooling might limit children's perspectives, as parents may unintentionally propagate a biased worldview. Also, they note that homeschooling involves administrative work and preparing children for exams, which could add to parental stress. In conclusion, the debate around banning homeschooling encompasses diverse views and angles, including the value of personalized learning and parental choice, versus the need for standardized education and societal interaction. Each side provides compelling arguments backed by evidence, leading to a complex and nuanced discussion."

","The opposition to the mandatory routine vaccination of children brings forth several arguments and evidence. Firstly, they suggest that routine child vaccinations may lead to harmful side effects. The CDC has reported instances where vaccines like the chickenpox vaccine can cause pneumonia, and a small possibility exists that the flu vaccine may result in Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, occurring in approximately one to two out of a million vaccinated individuals. Furthermore, the Rotashield vaccine for rotavirus had to be withdrawn from the market after its introduction due to potentially causing a higher incidence of bowel obstructions. The second claim is that mandatory vaccination contradicts fundamental rights. According to the opponents, the First Amendment of the US Constitution prevents laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion, which may extend to the refusal of vaccination on religious grounds. Also, they argue that compulsory vaccination infringes on the human right of bodily integrity, a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. Lastly, opponents contend that routine vaccinations are not necessary for maintaining children's health. Citing the Mayo Clinic, they argue that natural infection often provides more comprehensive immunity than a series of vaccinations."

    - Evidence 1: Two to three million deaths are prevented each year worldwide by vaccination, and an additional 1.5 million deaths could be prevented each year if all recommended vaccines were used..
    - Evidence 2: In the twentieth century, there were 16,316 deaths from polio and 29,004 deaths from smallpox yearly in the United States; in 2012 there were no reported cases of polio or smallpox..
    - Evidence 3: Diphtheria killed 21,053 people yearly, measles killed 530,217 people yearly, mumps killed 162,344 people yearly, rubella killed 47,745 people yearly, and Hib killed 20,000 people yearly in the twentieth century United States; by 2012 each of these diseases were decreased by 99% because of vaccinations..
    - Evidence 4: According to UNICEF, there were 500 cases of polio in 2014 worldwide (appearing only in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan), down from 350,000 cases in 1988, thanks to vaccination programs.
    - Evidence 5: After introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2000, several studies described a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States. One year after its introduction, a group of investigators found a 69% drop in the rate of invasive disease in those of less than two years of age..
- claim_2: Child vaccination saves lives.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that vaccination prevents 3.5–5 million deaths per year, and up to 1.5 million children die each year due to diseases that could have been prevented by vaccination.
    - Evidence 2: It is estimated that full vaccination, from birth to adolescence, of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections..
    - Evidence 3: According to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization, vaccines save 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, which equates to roughly 285 children saved every hour..
    - Evidence 4: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018..
    - Evidence 5: The measles vaccine has decreased childhood deaths from measles by 74%..
- claim_3: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated teenager who became infected during a visit to Romania.[REF] This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; three of them were hospitalized..
    - Evidence 3: Those seeking to enforce compulsory vaccination argued that the public good overrode personal freedom, a view supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905, a landmark ruling which set a precedent for cases dealing with personal freedom and the public good..
    - Evidence 4: An Apr. 2019 measles outbreak resulted in the quarantine of over 200 people who had been exposed to the measles on the campuses of the University of California at Los Angeles and California State University. Because they could not verify their vaccinations, quarantining them raised the campus’ herd immunity and blocked the spread of the disease..
    - Evidence 5: In 2011, 49 US states did not meet the 92-94% herd immunity threshold for pertussis (whooping cough), resulting in a 2012 outbreak that sickened 48,277 people and was the biggest outbreak since 1955..

    - Evidence 1: When rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur; however, they may occur again if the rate of vaccination decrease..
    - Evidence 2: Smallpox was a contagious and deadly disease, causing the deaths of 20–60% of infected adults and over 80% of infected children.[15] When smallpox was finally eradicated in 1979, it had already killed an estimated 300–500 million people in the 20th century..
    - Evidence 3: As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant..
    - Evidence 4: Vaccination during pregnancy is highly effective at protecting the infant from pertussis during their vulnerable early months of life, and is recommended in many countries..
    - Evidence 5: Pertussis vaccines are effective at preventing illness and are recommended for routine use by the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccine saved an estimated half a million lives in 2002..
- claim_5: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Vaccine-preventable diseases remain a common cause of childhood mortality with an estimated three million deaths each year..
    - Evidence 2: According to the World Health Organization (WHO): 'After observation of study populations for periods of up to 20 years in Japan and 10 years in the United States, more than 90% of immunocompetent persons who were vaccinated as children were still protected from varicella.'.
    - Evidence 3: Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats..
    - Evidence 4: As a more modest example, infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae (Hib), a major cause of bacterial meningitis and other serious diseases in children, have decreased by over 99% in the US since the introduction of a vaccine in 1988..
    - Evidence 5: Vaccine hesitancy has contributed to the resurgence of preventable disease. For example, in 2019, the number of measles cases increased by thirty percent worldwide and many cases occurred in countries that had nearly eliminated measles..
","Supporters of mandatory routine vaccinations for children argue for their effectiveness. They highlight that vaccinations prevent two to three million deaths annually worldwide, with a potential for more if all recommended vaccines are used. They provide historical data showing drastic decreases in deaths from diseases like polio, smallpox, diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella, thanks to vaccines. The significant reduction in polio cases globally, from 350,000 in 1988 to 500 in 2014, is noted as a significant achievement of vaccination programs. Next, supporters argue that child vaccinations save lives, with the World Health Organization estimating that vaccination prevents 3.5-5 million deaths per year. They present data showing that vaccination of all US children born in a given year would save 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections. Moreover, vaccines save approximately 2.5 million children from preventable diseases every year, according to Shot@Life, a United Nations Foundation partner organization. Vaccinations are also necessary to protect others, argue the supporters. They emphasize the concept of herd immunity, noting that outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur when the vaccination rate within a population is over 92%. They provide examples of outbreaks caused by unvaccinated individuals, showing that the protection of public health can supersede personal freedom, as upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Jacobson v. Massachusetts. Supporters further argue that routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading, highlighting again the role of herd immunity. They point to the success of the smallpox vaccine, which eradicated a disease that had been killing a significant proportion of infected adults and children. Lastly, supporters argue that children should not suffer from preventable diseases. The World Health Organization has observed that vaccine-preventable diseases cause an estimated three million deaths each year, a tragedy that could be averted with more extensive vaccination. Supporters also point to the dangers of vaccine hesitancy, which the World Health Organization categorizes as one of the top ten global health threats, and can lead to the resurgence of preventable diseases, as seen with the increase in measles cases worldwide in 2019."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:

The FTC’s failure to act imperils not only privacy but democracy as well.'.
    - Evidence 2: TikTok paid a $5.7 million fine for violating the children’s privacy law in 2019. Nevertheless, TikTok failed to delete personal information previously collected from children and was still collecting kids’ personal information without notice to and consent of parents..

It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.'.
    - Evidence 2: On October 18, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was scheduled to begin using personal information collected using social media platforms to screen immigrants arriving in the U.S. The department made this new measure known in a posting to the Federal Register in September 2017, noting that '...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results...' would be included in an applicant's immigration file. This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates..

    - Evidence 2: Herbert Lin - Senior Research Scholar, Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University, said:' Government regulation to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation is neither desirable nor feasible. It is not desirable because any process developed to address the problem cannot be made immune to political co-optation. '.
    - Evidence 3: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..
    - Evidence 4: Around the US 2016 election, Russian entities set up and promoted fake Pages on Facebook to influence public sentiment — essentially using social media as an information weapon..
    - Evidence 5: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
","Opponents to this topic present a number of robust arguments and evidence. Their first argument posits that social media regulation is not effective. They back this claim with several pieces of evidence. They reference the Federal Trade Commission's failure to enforce an order, resulting in the unlawful transfer of 87 million user records, which they argue imperils privacy and democracy. They also discuss the fine TikTok paid for violating children's privacy law, pointing out that the platform was still collecting children's personal information without consent. Further evidence is the inadequacy of California's Senate Bill No. 1001, intended to tackle the role of bots in fake news and advertising, as well as the noticeable gap in legislation holding platforms accountable for data privacy management. They also highlight the European General Data Protection Regulation (G.D.P.R.), citing the little action taken against Facebook and Google since its implementation. The second claim made by opponents of government regulation on social media is that it harms privacy. They refer to the government use of Social Media Monitoring Software (SMMS), which they argue can infrally track, monitor, and chart out individual activities and networks. They also call out the Department of Homeland Security's policy of using personal information collected from social media platforms to screen immigrants. The opponents argue that the majority of the public feel their potential risks due to data collection by companies and government outweigh the benefits and they have little or no control over how these entities use their personal information. Opponents then assert that social media regulation can harm freedom of speech and other democratic rights. To support this, they highlight warnings from the Open Rights Group and the Index on Censorship about the potential threat to freedom of expression. They also refer to the criticism towards tighter restrictions under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act as violations of the First Amendment. The evidence here suggests that nearly every country adopting laws relating to online content jeopardizes human rights, as seen with Peggy Hicks' statement, and the censorship situation in Vietnam following the passage of a cybersecurity law in 2018. Their fourth claim is that the government should not intervene in the affairs of a private company, arguing that government intervention can lead to bureaucracy and inefficiency, and can disrupt market systems that have a natural tendency to adjust and equalize. Finally, opponents assert that social media regulation can lead to political abuses by the government. They cite instances of the suppression of Palestinian voices during violence in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and how government regulation to prevent the spread of misinformation is susceptible to political co-optation. They also note instances where political pressures influenced public information, such as the altering of weather reports, and the manipulation of social media as an information weapon, as seen in the US 2016 elections and the political advertisements targeting minority communities. In summary, opponents of government regulation on social media argue that such regulation is ineffective, harms privacy, threatens freedom of speech, interferes with the operation of private companies, and can be co-opted for political abuses. They substantiate these claims with a variety of evidence from real-world instances of ineffective regulation, the detrimental impact on privacy, the potential suppression of free speech, the adverse effects of government intervention, and examples of political manipulation."

    - Evidence 3: Companies are obligated to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act if they know that children under age 13 use their platforms. The law, known as COPPA, gives parents control over what information online platforms can collect about their kids..
    - Evidence 4: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
    - Evidence 5: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice. We must see an independent, statutory regulator established as soon as possible, one which has the full support of the Government to take strong and effective actions against companies who do not comply,‘' said Lamb in a statement. ‘'It is imperative that we take every step to protect young people online as we do offline.‘'.
- claim_2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: “Platforms should be transparent about their content moderation decisions, prevent dangerous disinformation from going viral and avoid unsafe products being offered on marketplaces,” said Margrethe Vestager, who has spearheaded much of the bloc’s work to regulate the tech industry as the executive vice president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union..
    - Evidence 2: The European Union reached a deal on Saturday on landmark legislation that would force Facebook, YouTube and other internet services to combat misinformation, disclose how their services amplify divisive content and stop targeting online ads based on a person’s ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation..
    - Evidence 3: A recent Gallup poll found that only 37 percent believe “news organizations generally get the facts straight.” This is down from about half of the country who felt that way in 1998..
    - Evidence 4: Only 14 percent of Republicans believe the media report the news accurately, compared to 62 percent for Democrats. Even more disturbingly, 'a solid majority of the country believes major news organizations routinely produce false information.'.
    - Evidence 5: Fake content was widespread during the presidential campaign. Facebook has estimated that 126 million of its platform users saw articles and posts promulgated by Russian sources. Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.
- claim_3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Unlike the SARS outbreaks in 2003, the Chinese government has taken full advantage of social media to release real-time pandemic information and to refute false rumors about COVID-19..
    - Evidence 2: If we believe news headlines, social media is responsible for many of the major scourges of modern life. It is coarsening our political discourse, leading to polarization and division. It exposes vulnerable people to extremist ideology, driving them toward violence. Social media is addictive, can damage our body image and sense of self-worth..
    - Evidence 3: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 4: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
    - Evidence 5: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.
- claim_4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Along those lines, Senator Amy Klobuchar has proposed legislation to have the National Science Foundation identify “content neutral” restrictions on social media algorithms that might reduce the spread of harmful material..
    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
    - Evidence 3: Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'We will not allow child sexual abuse, terrorist material and other harmful content to fester on online platforms. Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.'.
    - Evidence 4: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 5: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The dramatic story of the consulting agency Cambridge Analytica is a case in point. The firm exploited the private information of over 50 million Facebook users to influence the 2016 American presidential election..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 3: Another rising concern, exacerbated by Cambridge Analytica’s breach of Facebook data, centers on how bad actors access private data from social media platforms and elsewhere and use it to manipulate opinions for the benefit of a few..
    - Evidence 4: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..
    - Evidence 5: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
","Supporters of this proposition advance several compelling arguments, underpinned by substantial evidence. Firstly, they assert that social media regulation protects younger audiences. Section 230 was enacted by Congress to promote First Amendment and e-commerce interests, but also to safeguard minors. Furthermore, groups like EPIC have filed complaints urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and penalize platforms like TikTok for violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). This law gives parents control over the information collected about their children under 13 years old on these platforms. Anecdotal evidence, such as the case of Molly Russell, a young British teenager whose distressing social media feeds allegedly contributed to her death, reinforces the need for regulation. The necessity for an independent, statutory regulator with government backing, rather than self-regulation, was underscored by Lamb. Secondly, proponents argue that regulation is necessary to combat fake news. They cite the stance of Margrethe Vestager, a European Commission executive, advocating for transparency in content moderation to prevent the spread of dangerous disinformation. Legislation like the Digital Services Act in the EU forces platforms to combat misinformation and disclose their content promotion policies. Public faith in news accuracy is waning, with only 37% believing news organizations generally get the facts straight, highlighting the need for intervention. The widespread dissemination of fake content during the presidential campaign, as demonstrated by Facebook and Twitter statistics, further underscores this point. The third argument posits that social media regulation is beneficial to society at large. The Chinese government has utilized social media to release accurate pandemic information and refute false COVID-19 rumors, demonstrating potential societal benefits. However, without regulation, social media can also exacerbate societal problems like political polarization, extremism, and mental health issues. Pending legislation in the EU aims to make platforms more transparent and eliminate manipulative techniques, aiming for societal benefit. The fourth contention is that regulation can address negative content on social media. Proposed legislation like Senator Amy Klobuchar's aims to restrict social media algorithms' spread of harmful material. The European Union's Digital Services Act intends to hold companies accountable for policing illicit content on their platforms. Further support comes from tech leaders like Richard Pursey who state that online safety is a fundamental human right and government regulation is the way forward. Lastly, advocates argue that regulation is necessary to handle malicious users. This argument is substantiated by instances like the Cambridge Analytica scandal where private information from Facebook was exploited to influence the 2016 American presidential election. According to Pew Trust, 13% of Americans have had their social media accounts hijacked, and incidents like the Russian operation Internet Research Agency meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election demonstrate the harm that can be done. In conclusion, the supporters of government regulation of social media platforms bring forth a robust argument in its favor, substantiated by a multitude of evidences, and covering various areas from the protection of minors to the necessity of countering disinformation."

    - Evidence 5: As Ezra Klein and other writers have noted, divisions between the two parties have intensified over time as various types of identities have become 'stacked' on top of people’s partisan identities..
- claim_3: The US has a negative culture.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Hustle Culture tells us that if we aren’t spending our entire waking lives working, we deserve to be poor!.
    - Evidence 2: I struggle so much with this insane work culture in America. We are so freaking proud of working ourselves to death..
    - Evidence 3: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
    - Evidence 4: In a recent opinion piece for The New York Times, Anne-Marie Slaughter laments the state of the current American workplace, which she considers toxic by nature..
    - Evidence 5: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Consequently, a struggling Man­hat­tan family with a yearly salary of $60,000, but a standard of living uncomfortably close to the federal poverty line, is taxed at a higher rate than a family with that same standard of living in Atlanta (making $26,000 a year)..
    - Evidence 2: As he accepted the Republican nomination for president, Donald Trump stated that “America is one of the highest-taxed countries in the world,” while promoting his tax cut proposal..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers estimate, for example, that 80 percent of families saw the share of budgets dedicated to spending on needs such as housing and health care increase by more than 7 percentage points between 1984 and 2014, potentially crowding out spending on other categories like leisure, longer-term investments in education, and saving for retirement..
    - Evidence 4: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
    - Evidence 5: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: There are 750,000 Americans who are homeless on any given night, with one in five of them considered chronically homeless. The ranks of the sheltered homeless include disproportionate numbers of males, blacks, middle-aged people (i.e., ages 31-50), veterans, and disabled..
    - Evidence 2: In the United States, 21 percent of all children are in poverty, a poverty rate higher than what prevails in virtually all other rich nations..
    - Evidence 3: The ownership of wealth among households in the U.S. became somewhat more concentrated since the 1980s. The top 10% of households controlled 68.2 percent of the total wealth in 1983 and 73.1% of the total wealth in 2007..
    - Evidence 4: In 2021, the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth, up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent (roughly sixty-three million families) owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021..
    - Evidence 5: The United States’ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019—the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany—according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: In this edition of the Poll, 65% of people in the USA said they were worried about violent crime as a threat to their safety, with a four-percentage-point increase (from 22% to 26%) in people feeling ‘very worried’ compared to 2019. This put worry about crime second to concern about road traffic collisions (73%)..
    - Evidence 2: Almost two in five people (39%) in the USA feel less safe than they did five years ago – up from 27% in 2019 – a new global report shows..
    - Evidence 3: The US has the highest rate of death by guns in the developed world, and more than double the gun ownership rates than Yemen, a country that has been embroiled in a civil war since 2014..
    - Evidence 4: An astounding 1.5 million Americans died by gunfire between 1986 and 2017..
    - Evidence 5: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..
- claim_7: The US is xenophobic/racist.
  Evidence supporting claim_7:
    - Evidence 1: A range of scholars from at least the late 19th century to the present have produced arguments that white supremacy exists in U.S. school curriculum, oftentimes to the detriment of non-White students Americans' learning outcomes and the whole of American society..
    - Evidence 2: 'Xenophobia doesn’t just reveal itself through a bigoted relative who is saying stuff about ‘the Mexicans’ at Thanksgiving dinner,' says Lee. 'Xenophobia is a form of racism that has been embedded in our laws.'.
    - Evidence 3: For example, Germans were first labeled “swarthy,” a term that was meant to signify blackness and to imply that German immigration was undesirable..
    - Evidence 4: Nearly three in ten Asian Americans report experiencing racial slurs or jokes since the start of the pandemic, over 6,600 incidents of hate crime (including physical attacks on Asian elders) have been reported nationwide, and six women were murdered at three Asian-owned spas in Georgia in March 2021..
    - Evidence 5: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
","Opponents make several compelling claims about the challenges faced by citizens due to systemic issues. Claim 1 asserts that the US has unfair health and education policies, substantiated by evidence like racial bias in education (with white teachers often providing less constructive feedback to Black or Latino students), and health insurance disparities. This results in significant portions of the population, particularly Black and Hispanic adults, as well as uninsured individuals, struggling to afford healthcare costs. Opponents' second claim posits that the US has a divisive political system. This is demonstrated through the polarized perspectives that emerged during the 2020 presidential election and differing views on significant national issues such as the economy, racial justice, and climate change. Moreover, the nation's division was palpable during the coronavirus outbreak, where perceptions on the government's response were starkly different between Republicans and Democrats. The third claim, that the US has a negative culture, is supported with evidence pointing to a pervasive 'hustle culture' that glorifies overwork and dismisses leisure, misuse of digital technology, and an apparent lack of respect for one another within the society. Fourthly, the high cost of living and taxation is seen as problematic. Demonstrated by the struggles of families living near the poverty line in areas like Manhattan being taxed higher than those with similar standards of living in less expensive cities. Furthermore, increases in spending on necessities like housing and healthcare are outpacing income growth, putting additional financial pressure on families. Claim 5 draws attention to the issue of inequality and poverty, evidenced by the significant homelessness rates, high child poverty levels compared to other wealthy nations, and concentrated wealth in the hands of the top 10% of households. The United States' Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, is comparable to countries like Bulgaria and Turkey, suggesting a significant wealth gap. The opponents' sixth claim suggests that the US is unsafe, as indicated by public concerns about violent crime, increasing feelings of insecurity compared to five years ago, and alarmingly high rates of gun-related deaths. The country's ranking for general quality of life also slipped due to safety concerns. Finally, the seventh claim points out xenophobia and racism in the US. Arguments exist that white supremacy has been present in the U.S. school curriculum for centuries, negatively impacting non-White students. This systemic racism extends beyond education, with examples provided, such as racial slurs against Asian Americans and the poorer health profiles of middle-class Black Americans due to racialized trauma. In sum, opponents argue that the United States' systemic issues in health and education policy, divisive political landscape, pervasive negative culture, high cost of living, inequality, safety concerns, and issues of racism and xenophobia make the country a less than ideal place to live."

","The proponents of the argument that 'The USA is a good country to live in' put forth several significant claims supported by strong evidence. They begin with the claim that the US has a robust economy and high standard of living. Evidence in support of this includes a comparison of the per capita income, which was $56,300 in 2015 - one of the highest in the developed world. Joseph Sullivan in a column for National Review also highlights that between 2016 and 2019, economic growth in the U.S. was the best among its peers, surpassing other nations such as Finland and Sweden. Moreover, with 67% of people aged 15 to 64 having a paid job, the employment rate in the US is slightly above the OECD average. The second claim is that the US has exemplary health and education systems. The US ranks 8th in the United Nations Human Development Index which measures health, education, and per capita income levels. A significant proportion of adults aged 25-64 (92%) have completed upper secondary education, which is higher than the OECD average of 79%. Moreover, the US education system is globally respected, with 40 out of 100 top universities located in the country, according to a 2014 survey. Third, the argument posits that the US boasts an impressive environment and nature. The estimated value of natural resources in the U.S. is substantial at $45 trillion, with coal and timber making up a large proportion of this. The country also hosts a diverse range of landscapes and natural wonders, ranging from the Rocky Mountains to the Grand Canyon, and is home to an impressive variety of wildlife. The fourth claim advocates for the democratic rights and freedoms prevalent in the US. According to 'Human Rights: The Essential Reference,' the American Declaration of Independence was the first civic document to define modern human rights. In addition, citizens enjoy the right to peaceful public protest, as guaranteed by the First Amendment. In terms of culture, proponents argue that the US is rich and diverse, greatly influencing the rest of the world. The US is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world due to the influences of Indigenous Americans, Latin Americans, Africans, Asians, and English settlers who colonized the country in the 1600s. This diversity has led to the United States being described as a 'melting pot' of cultures. Additionally, the argument highlights the country's global power, ranking as the world's most powerful country according to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and US News & World Report. The US's economic, military, and cultural dominance underscore this position, making it a leader in the global order. Finally, the US offers ample opportunities for individuals, especially in the job market. The Department of Labor reports that there are about 9.8 million job vacancies, with job growth surging in recent months, providing unmatched career opportunities. Consequently, proponents argue that the abundant job opportunities and the presence of offices of almost all major global companies make the US a land of unique opportunities."
The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A leading participant in the Council, Eusebius of Caesarea, wrote: It is fitting that those in the priesthood and occupied in the service of God, should abstain after ordination from the intercourse of marriage..
    - Evidence 2: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
    - Evidence 3: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 4: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
    - Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Gray held a series of councils in his diocese from 1241 to 1255 which endeavoured to enforce clerical celibacy, keep benefices from being inherited, and improve the education and morals of the clergy..
    - Evidence 2: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
    - Evidence 3: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 4: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption..
    - Evidence 5: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 3: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..

- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..
    - Evidence 2: Theresia (Katharina Schoenberger); Sr. Agnes (Elisabeth Haas); Sr. Elisabeth (Anna Maria Mueller); Sr. Klara (Elisabeth Meuser)) took the vows of celibacy, obedience and poverty in front of the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum..
    - Evidence 3: Philippe Delhaye wrote: During the first three or four centuries, no law was promulgated prohibiting clerical marriage. Celibacy was a matter of choice for bishops, priests, and deacons... The apostolic constitutions (c. 400) excommunicated a priest or bishop who left his wife 'under pretense of piety' (Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio 1:51)..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Paul VI brings as witness the value of celibacy testified by many religious in the Church throughout the world, in many times and locations.
    - Evidence 2: Among the early Church statements on the topic of sexual continence and celibacy are the Directa and Cum in unum decretals of Pope Siricius (c. 385), which asserted that clerical sexual abstinence was an apostolic practice that must be followed by ministers of the church.
    - Evidence 3: Another important matter which the legate had been ordered to carry out was the enforcement of the law of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: Siricius was emphatic that clerical continence belonged to immemorial, even apostolic, tradition. He declared that priests had been under a duty to observe temporary continence when serving in the Temple, but that the coming of Christ had brought the old priesthood to completion, and by this fact the duty of temporary continence had become an obligation to perpetual continence..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Celibacy could have contributed to the instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, a report by the church’s Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia has found. The report, released on Friday as a response to the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, said “obligatory celibacy” for Catholic priests “may … have contributed to abuse in some circumstances”, and recommended priests undergo “psycho-sexual development” training..
    - Evidence 2: The Archbishop of Vienna today said priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals to hit the Catholic church. In an article for Thema Kirche, his diocesan magazine, Christoph Schonborn became the most senior figure in the Catholic hierarchy to make the connection between the two and called for an unflinching examination of the possible reasons for paedophilia..

","Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God: Opponents claim that celibacy allows priests to devote their lives completely to God, free from the obligations and distractions of family life. Eusebius of Caesarea, a leading figure in the Council, argued that those serving God should abstain from marital relations. This view was echoed by Paul VI, who said that celibacy enables a closer relationship with God and that it is sustained by divine grace. Moreover, Garry Wills in his book 'Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit' argued that celibacy played a pivotal role in establishing the Church as an influential institution. Clerical celibacy, according to advocates, is a special gift allowing ministers to be closer to Christ and dedicate themselves more freely to God and their neighbour. Celibacy is a strong religious belief: Opposition to abandoning celibacy is rooted in the historical and spiritual traditions of the church. Gray, for example, held a series of councils between 1241 and 1255 enforcing clerical celibacy and improving clergy education. Clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' from the church's beginnings, seen as a spiritual marriage with Christ, a view popularized by early Christian theologian Origen. Moreover, mandatory celibacy became canon law in 1074 under Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate corruption. Celibacy makes priests to be perceived as holy: The opponents argue that celibacy helps foster the perception of priests as holy figures. Pope's upholding of celibacy presents it as not just an alternative to marriage, but a different form of love that is equally demanding and genuine. In 387 or 390, a Council of Carthage decreed that those serving divine sacraments should observe perfect continence, a practice that was seen to heighten their spiritual purity. Priests choose to be celibate: The opposition underscores that celibacy is a personal choice made by those who join the priesthood. As Laurent Cleenewerck, an Orthodox Church priest, indicates, celibacy was favored and viewed as a gift by Paul. Some nuns and priests, such as Sr. Theresia and Sr. Agnes, among others, willingly took vows of celibacy. Philippe Delhaye noted that for the first few centuries, clerical marriage was not prohibited; celibacy was a personal choice. Religious experiences and traditions should be maintained: The opponents also argue that religious traditions, including celibacy, should be preserved. They cite Pope Siricius, who asserted in the 4th century that clerical sexual abstinence was an apostolic practice that should be upheld. Removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts: The opponents claim that abandoning celibacy might lead to sexually reckless behavior. This argument is supported by reports suggesting that celibacy could have contributed to instances of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, implying that without the discipline of celibacy, sexual recklessness could become more prevalent."

- claim_1: Celibacy is outdated.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, the knights of the order were virtually secularized: Pope Paul III commuted their vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity (1540)..
    - Evidence 2: George T. Dennis SJ of Catholic University of America says: 'There is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.' Peter Fink SJ agrees, saying that underlying premises used in the book, Apostolic Origins of Priestly Celibacy, 'would not stand up so comfortably to historical scrutiny'. Dennis says this book provides no evidence that celibacy had apostolic origins..
    - Evidence 3: In 1874 Old Catholics removed the requirement of clerical celibacy..
    - Evidence 4: From its beginnings, the idea of clerical celibacy has been contested in canon courts, in theology, and in religious practices..
    - Evidence 5: Perhaps the most striking example is that in most Eastern Catholic Churches, ordination of married men to the priesthood is routine (although no priest may marry after ordination, and only celibate priests may become bishops)..
- claim_2: Celibacy is too pressuring/diffcult.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Records suggest that some of the nuns, returned to their families with small pensions of ¬£4 a year and still under monastic vows of celibacy, endured considerable hardship as a result of the closure of the convent..
    - Evidence 2: It's not just biology, sexual chemistry makes celibacy a difficult lifestyle, says Jimmy O'Brien. Women sometimes saw priests as forbidden fruit and a bit of a challenge, he remembers. But what he found hardest was not having someone to share life with..
    - Evidence 3: Forcing priests to suppress their urges or hide their sexual behaviour has warped people, believes Elizabeth Abbott, author of A History of Celibacy: For thousands of years it's failed. It brings out horrible things..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Protestant apologists further argue that clerical celibacy violates the Biblical teaching in the First Epistle to Timothy:. The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth. For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving..
    - Evidence 2: Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen's depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced..
    - Evidence 3: Men are driven by testosterone to want sex, says John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University. Women are driven to a lesser degree by a mixture of testosterone and oestrogen, he explains. ’I'd regard celibacy as a totally abnormal state.’ Around 80-90% of men masturbate and it's likely that priests do too, he says. There is data to suggest that men who ejaculate more are less prone to prostate cancer, he says. You could argue that it's not so healthy to be celibate..

Firstly, they contend that celibacy is outdated, as there's no clear evidence of an obligation of priestly celibacy before the fourth century, as argued by experts such as George T.

They also point to the numerous instances of secularization and removal of the requirement of celibacy, such as Pope Paul III commuting the vow of celibacy to one of conjugal fidelity in 1540 and the Old Catholics' removal of the celibacy requirement in 1874. Secondly, they argue that celibacy is too pressuring or difficult, supported by anecdotes like Jimmy O'Brien's admission of the difficulty of celibacy and Elizabeth Abbott's assertion that celibacy has warped people throughout history. The third argument states celibacy is unnatural and unhealthy, with John Wass, Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University, claiming that celibacy is an abnormal state. Critics also cite Biblical passages that seemingly oppose celibacy, such as the First Epistle to Timothy. The fourth argument revolves around the claim that celibacy leads to inappropriate sexual behavior. This is supported by evidence such as numerous allegations of sexual abuse against Catholic priests and statements from religious figures like Christoph Schönborn and Hans Küng, who associate priestly celibacy with sexual abuse scandals. Finally, they believe celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests, as suggested by the experience of Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck and Gerard's complaint about York canons avoiding ordination to evade the vow of celibacy."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Moreover, a 2010 CDC study on child well-being and family structure shows that children from homes with married parents did better in every category..
    - Evidence 2: Research by the Institute for American Values shows that children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused, less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviors, have a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager, and are less likely to be raised in poverty..
    - Evidence 3: Children raised in intact married families tend to earn higher grades than those in non-intact families.1) For example, kindergarten children from married families have higher reading scores than those from cohabiting families.2) Parents in always-intact married families are also more likely to help their children do their homework than are parents in stepfamilies or single-parent families,3) and fathers in always-intact married families are more involved in their children’s homework than are stepfathers.4) Compared with children in stable married families, students experiencing parental divorce have lower academic expectations and test scores.5).
    - Evidence 4: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 5: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization..
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church..
    - Evidence 3: Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually..
    - Evidence 4: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 5: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Evidence published by John Helliwell (and Shawn Grover) in the Journal of Happiness Studies finds that marriage makes people happier and that they continue to be more satisfied years into the marriage..
    - Evidence 2: Married people overall do better on virtually every indicator of health and well-being, says Robin Simon, a sociology professor and researcher at Wake Forest University. Even when they get sick, married people are more likely to recover..
    - Evidence 3: But while cohabitation is on the rise, data from Pew and other sources continue to show that married Americans enjoy greater overall happiness, as well as greater satisfaction with their relationships. The marriage happiness premium extends to nearly every aspect of a couple's relationship, with one notable exception: their sex lives..
    - Evidence 4: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 5: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult. About eight-in-ten married adults (78%) say they feel closer to their spouse than to any other adult in their life; a narrower majority of cohabiters (55%) say the same about their partner..
    - Evidence 2: Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly..
    - Evidence 3: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult.
    - Evidence 4: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 5: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: One of the most significant advantages of marriage is eligibility for Social Security spousal and survival benefits. First, as a married couple, you're each eligible to collect your own Social Security benefit or up to 50 percent of your spouse's benefit, whichever is greater. This can be a financial plus if one of you is a higher earner..
    - Evidence 2: Getting married makes financial sense, especially for people who have widely disparate incomes. For example: The annual income limitations for IRA contributions by married couples are based on joint income, allowing for far higher savings. A couple's combined income may well place them in a lower tax bracket than the higher-income spouse would pay as an individual. If each spouse has a different employer, each can choose the better of two health insurance plans. Car insurance and home insurance coverage are cheaper for two than for one. In the long run, the lower-paid spouse may be eligible for a larger Social Security benefit than the person's solo income would allow..
    - Evidence 3: One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage..
    - Evidence 4: One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill..
    - Evidence 5: There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married..
","Opponents of the idea that we should abandon marriage present equally compelling arguments. First and foremost, they argue that marriage significantly benefits children, backed by a wealth of research from institutes like the CDC and the Institute for American Values. These studies show children from married families often outperform their peers from non-intact families in various areas, including education, health, and behavior. Secondly, they maintain that marriage is crucial for people, whether for religious, traditional, or general reasons. They cite its long history as an institution essential for social stability and argue that marriage mirrors our Creator’s unconditional love for us. The third argument declares that marriage makes people happier. Research conducted by John Helliwell published in the Journal of Happiness Studies, Robin Simon's research at Wake Forest University, and data from Pew all support the idea that married individuals generally report higher happiness and satisfaction levels than their unmarried counterparts. The fourth argument posits that marriage brings the couple closer. A survey suggests that married adults feel closer to their spouse than any other adult, and trust levels are also notably higher in marriages than in cohabiting relationships. Finally, they argue that marriage provides important financial benefits. Benefits range from Social Security spousal and survival benefits to income splitting, tax advantages, and cheaper insurance coverage. Inheritance tax benefits are also mentioned as a significant financial advantage for married couples."
We should abandon marriage,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to CNN, dowry-related woman abuse in the country is often caused by dissatisfaction over the amount of dowry received, as it has become more of a condition of marriage, rather than a gift. Women are known to commit suicide, driven by the pressure of not being able to keep up with dowry payments, or they face violence within their marriage, or are murdered for the same reason..
    - Evidence 2: Millions of girls around the world experience female genital mutilation (FGM) as a prerequisite to marriage or as a means to control a woman’s sexuality before marriage. This is an infringement on a woman’s right to her bodily autonomy, and as it is often performed on school-aged girls, also stops them from being able to access education and deprives them of their childhood, as well as causing both short- and long-term health consequences..
    - Evidence 3: Women must be submissive to male family members in all aspects of her life. Rigid gender roles often result in the expectation that women be submissive to male family members. When married, women are expected to obey their husbands, act according to their wishes and not strive for equal decision making. If they transgress these norms they may face physical violence used by husbands as punishment or discipline..
    - Evidence 4: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
    - Evidence 5: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Alison, for instance, found that her husband would go out with his friends at the weekend while she stayed at home, preparing lessons and doing the housework. Then there are factors that have the capacity to bring everything to a head. Money is one. “He’d say, ‘Well, you chose to have a low-paid job,’” Alison says. By then they’d had a (planned and wanted) baby, and children are another acknowledged marriage stressor. They bring high strain (in terms of finances, fatigue and housework) and often highlight different standards of care. “It wasn’t an easy time,” Alison says. “It reinforced just how different we were. Before, when we argued, I just thought, ‘Well, we’ll make up a few hours later.’ But when you’ve got a child, you don’t want to be falling out all the time..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 3: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
    - Evidence 4: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 5: nan.

    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..

- claim_4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 3: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
    - Evidence 4: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 5: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","The proponents for abandoning marriage argue that the institution is oppressive towards women, unstable, laden with unfair obligations, and its purported advantages can be achieved by monogamous relationships. Evidence cited includes harmful norms that undermine women's rights, such as dowry-related abuse, female genital mutilation, and the expectation of female submission (CNN, personal accounts). The claim of marital instability is supported by evidence showing a global increase in divorce rates since the 1970s, with a peak of 48% of American marriages in the 1970s ending within 25 years (UN, Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers). Critics further argue that marriages often come with unfair obligations, citing examples of restrictive laws in Qatar, and medieval laws that enforced marital coercion and female subservience. Lastly, proponents assert that the emotional intimacy, reduced STD risks, and emotional stability expected in marriages can also be achieved in monogamous relationships."

- claim_1: Children can still express themselves using other means.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A former student at Hershey High School (Hershey, PA), wrote in her May 31, 2009 oped titled “The Case for High School Uniforms,” published on PennLive.com: “Contrary to popular belief, uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. Uniforms do not silence voices. Students can wear a variety of expressive items, such as buttons or jewelry….
    - Evidence 2: According to research published by Andrea Dashiell, 54% of eighth graders said that they still felt like they could express themselves in important ways even though they were being asked to follow a school uniform policy..
    - Evidence 3: Free speech does not relate to the regulations of clothing type or the length of a skirt. Fashion is not considered to be the purse speech in the United States that the Constitution guarantees..

- claim_2: School uniform reduces bullying.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: According to the long study and governments statistics gathered children are at higher risk if they “are perceived as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, wearing glasses or different clothing, being new to a school, or being unable to afford what kids consider 'cool.'.
    - Evidence 2: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 3: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
    - Evidence 4: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: B.R. international Public School shows that alongside featuring unity, uniforms likewise promote equality. Envision the circumstance without school uniforms. Students would show up in garments of their decision. Regardless of the amount we attempt, this will ingrain inequality- kids from rich foundations would wear their marked garments and adornments, while other students would build up a feeling of inadequacy..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..
    - Evidence 3: In a Texas survey of approximately one thousand middle schools, it was found that students in uniforms “reported significantly more positive perceptions of belonging in their school community than reported by students in the standard dress group” (David L. Brunsma)..
    - Evidence 4: Uniform is defined by Joseph and Alex (1972) as a costume identifying similar appearance, distinctiveness, or uniformity of a group. They viewed that uniform is not only attire that an individual wears, but also symbolizes membership of group, while creating exclusion and otherness to people outside the group..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Students in uniform are more focused in their academics which also helps to minimise disciplinary problems. With a uniform policy teachers can spend more time teaching in the classrooms rather than keeping a check on students if they are dressed appropriately or not..
    - Evidence 2: Natasha Irshad said 'One of the major distractions faced by schools with no uniform policy is focusing on the wardrobes of other children. Kids will be focusing more on the clothes of other kids rather than focusing on studying.'.
    - Evidence 3: In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result..
    - Evidence 4: One study showed that 70% of principals believed that mandated school uniforms reduced disciplinary problems at their schools..
    - Evidence 5: Some people believe that a school uniform can improve learning by reducing distraction, sharpening focus on schoolwork and making the classroom a more serious environment, allowing students to perform better academically..
- claim_5: School uniforms saves costs.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: According to recent NY Post article, most parents responded that they spent $48 on pants for their children and that $30 was a reasonable price for a T-shirt. Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..
    - Evidence 2: A UK study found that the average school uniform costs parents £88.05. The average non-school outfit, on the other hand, sets parents back £113.00..
    - Evidence 3: A national survey of 517 US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe 'one of the main benefits to parents is that school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel,' and 77% estimated the average annual cost of school uniforms per child to be $150 or less..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Opponents of this view argue that uniforms do not inhibit self-expression, reduce bullying, create a sense of equality and unity, encourage discipline and focus on learning, and can be cost-saving. In the case of self-expression, evidence indicates that students can express themselves in other ways and that fashion is not considered pure speech protected by the constitution (Andrea Dashiell, former student op-ed). The claim of reduced bullying is backed by evidence from the Department of Education and the Schoolwear Association, showing that uniforms can reduce bullying by minimizing differences in appearance. On the matter of equality and unity, research shows that uniforms promote a sense of belonging and reduce socioeconomic inequality (B.R. International Public School, David L. Brunsma). Uniforms are said to encourage discipline and focus on learning, as evidenced by Natasha Irshad's statement and a study revealing that 70% of principals believe uniforms reduce disciplinary problems. Finally, the cost-saving aspect of uniforms is supported by data indicating that school uniforms can be less expensive than regular apparel (NY Post, UK study)."
We should abandon the use of school uniform,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon the use of school uniform', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: School uniform harms learning/creativity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The people who make up the rules for uniform requirement have false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same. That sounds more like a post-apocalyptic society in which we are all forced to think the same and have no choices in our lives from the day we are born, similar to novels such as Anthem and Fahrenheit 451..
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..
    - Evidence 3: Senior Alyse Madsen said. “Strict dress codes infringe on a students self-expression and make for a dull environment with little creativity.”.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: School uniform is harming the student's self expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Based on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that 'it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.'.
    - Evidence 2: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 3: According to Dr. Alan Hilfer, child psychologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, this may lead to situations in which teenage students start resenting uniforms, undermining the whole purpose of the measure..
    - Evidence 4: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 5: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: School uniforms can seem like an added expense for families already struggling due to the increasing costs of bills and essential items. With the news that families could find themselves £1,200 worse off each year..
    - Evidence 2: In a study of consumer costs of uniforms and whether money is actually saved, researchers found that uniforms do not replace kid's clothing, and parents actually ended up spending more money on clothes when uniforms are required..
    - Evidence 3: 95 percent of parents think school uniforms cost too much. About 16 percent said they’ve had to cut back on food and other essentials to pay for uniforms, and 13 percent said its pushed them into debt..
    - Evidence 4: The Children’s Society estimated recently that the average cost of a school uniform is now £340..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Children's Society from 2020 showed the average spent on school uniform per year was £337 for each secondary child and £315 for primary in Wales. The costs were three times what parents thought was acceptable..
- claim_4: School uniforms are often uncomfortable/sexist.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, many types of clothes popular among female students (especially during hot weather) are considered to be “sexually suggestive” (“School dress codes,” 2017, para. 7). According to the proponents of such rules for teenage girls, short skirts and similar clothes contribute to sexual crime in schools (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 2: Dr Johanna Reidy from Otago’s Department of Public Health says girls are forced to wear uniforms that stop them from being active during breaks or cycling to school..
    - Evidence 3: A researcher from the University of Otago says a radical redesign of uniforms is needed.  Students are often made to wear school uniforms that leave them too hot in summer, too cold in winter and are physically restrictive for girls..
    - Evidence 4: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
    - Evidence 5: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..
- claim_5: School uniforms increase conformity or harm individuality.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: This idea is supported by testimony from a 17-year-old student forced to wear uniforms. Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
    - Evidence 2: According to Grace Chen of the Public School Review, forced conformity may leave students ill prepared to enter the adult world where appearance matters even if uniforms are not required..
    - Evidence 3: 'School uniforms only reinforce the notion that authority and obedience matter most, which does not factor into dressing appropriately for a job in an adult career field' contends Scott Key of Fresno State University..
    - Evidence 4: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
    - Evidence 5: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","Those who advocate for the abandonment of school uniforms present several compelling arguments. Firstly, they contend that school uniforms harm learning and creativity. This argument is grounded on the perspectives of academics, students, and fiction narratives. According to Dr. Tara Maginnis, uniforms promote conformity over creativity and impinge upon students' constitutional rights to free speech and expression. Senior Alyse Madsen further notes that strict dress codes limit students' self-expression and lead to a sterile, creativity-stifled environment. Secondly, the supporters argue that school uniforms can suppress students' self-expression. This argument relies on the First Amendment, scholarly studies, and expert opinions. A study from Arizona State University suggests that students from schools without uniform policies have a higher self-perception. Child psychologist Dr. Alan Hilfer notes that this might result in students resenting uniforms, defeating their intended purpose. Moreover, Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, argues that uniforms can instigate self-image issues, especially among body-diverse students. Thirdly, advocates highlight the financial strain uniforms place on families. Research reveals that school uniforms can pose an additional expense for families, pushing some into debt. The Children's Society estimates that the average cost of a school uniform is now around £340, a cost three times what parents consider acceptable. The fourth argument revolves around the uncomfortable and potentially sexist nature of school uniforms. Critics argue that uniforms can contribute to sexual crime in schools and hinder girls' physical activity. Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project, asserts that dress codes can implicitly encourage the acceptance of male entitlement to female bodies. The data from a GLSEN study corroborates this, showing a significant percentage of LGBT and transgender students were prevented from wearing clothes that reflected their identities. Lastly, the opposition to school uniforms suggests that uniforms stifle individuality and enforce conformity. Grace Chen of the Public School Review states that forced conformity might leave students ill-equipped for adult life where personal appearance plays a critical role. Other researchers point out that choosing their attire encourages independent thinking in students and prepares them for adulthood."

We are one step closer to providing victims’ families and loved ones with the justice and closure they are owed by law. I will sign this legislation as soon as it gets to my desk..
    - Evidence 2: Leslie Rutledge, JD, Arkansas Attorney General, and Tom Cotton, JD, US Senator (R-AR), in a Sep. 17, 2019 article, Justice Served: Resuming Death Penalty Right Thing, available at arkansasag.gov, stated: Though we understand some Arkansans have principled objections to the death penalty, we believe the ultimate punishment is warranted for the most heinous murderers. Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..

The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
    - Evidence 3: Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals..
    - Evidence 4: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 5: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","Opponents of the abolition of capital punishment present a series of arguments for the death penalty's retention. They claim that it helps victims and their families find justice and closure. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster and Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge express their support for the death penalty, asserting that it provides justice for victims' families and loved ones. They also maintain that the death penalty is acceptable in cases of severe crimes, drawing upon the assertions of Prime Minister Tony Blair and Human Rights Watch, both of whom acknowledge the severity of certain offenses that might warrant capital punishment. Thirdly, they argue that the death penalty acts as a powerful deterrent to crimes. Charles Stimson of the Heritage Foundation cites general and specific deterrence and retribution as the primary penological objectives served by capital punishment. Armstrong Williams and David Muhlhausen also emphasize the deterrent effect, suggesting that the death penalty communicates a clear message to potential criminals and reduces murder rates. Lastly, they affirm the preventative function of the death penalty. Drawing on the research by Hashem Dezhbakhsh and Joanna Shepherd, the proponents underscore that capital punishment has a strong deterrent effect, with each execution potentially preventing an average of eighteen murders. This perspective reaffirms their belief that capital punishment is necessary to maintain societal order and safety."

    - Evidence 2: Judge Fogel halted the execution to permit time to review whether the new injection procedures addressed previous objections..
    - Evidence 3: In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of people with mental retardation in Atkins v. Virginia, ruling that the practice constitutes cruel and unusual punishment..
    - Evidence 4: Execution is the ultimate, irrevocable punishment: the risk of executing an innocent person can never be eliminated. And such mistakes cannot be unmade. Since 1976, 143 US death row prisoners have been exonerated completely for their crimes..
    - Evidence 5: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..

    - Evidence 2: The death penalty is a waste of taxpayer funds and has no public safety benefit. The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
    - Evidence 3: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..

    - Evidence 2: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 3: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
    - Evidence 4: Nick Petersen, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Miami, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: Social science research does not support the contention that the death penalty deters crime. In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that “available studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.” A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion. Citing a number of problems with deterrence research, the council reported that “claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgments about capital punishment..
    - Evidence 5: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
","Supporters for the abolition of capital punishment believe it is inherently wrong, detrimental to the disenfranchised, and irreversible. They argue that state-sanctioned killing goes against the principles of human rights. Evidence from Amnesty International confirms this, stating that capital punishment is the ultimate denial of human rights. Further support comes from past court cases, such as Atkins v. Virginia, where the execution of people with mental retardation was ruled as cruel and unusual punishment, thereby indicating the intrinsic wrongness of the death penalty. Supporters also assert that the death penalty disproportionately affects the disenfranchised. They cite that the application of the death penalty is unfair and often skewed against people of color, and those who can't afford skilled attorneys. Furthermore, a study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts showed that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was almost eight times greater than a non-death penalty case, suggesting that the financial burden of capital punishment could be better utilized in areas that improve public safety, health, and welfare. Finally, the argument that the death penalty is irreversible is supported by numerous studies and statements. One key point is the inability of the death penalty to deter crime. In 2012, the National Research Council concluded that studies claiming capital punishment deters crime were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, the fact that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent is a strong argument against its use. As H. Lee Sarokin, a former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, stated, fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force."

    - Evidence 2: Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) was a strong supporter of these committees, which aimed to further support the goals of the PRO-IP Act, centered upon protecting American intellectual property and in turn, protect innovation central to the U.S. economy and its job market..
    - Evidence 3: By codifying intellectual property for plant breeders, UPOV aims to encourage the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society..
    - Evidence 4: Some copyright scholars believe that, regardless of contemporary advances in technology, copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works, and that without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created..
    - Evidence 5: The basic public policy rationale for the protection of intellectual property is that IP laws facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovation into the public domain for the common good, by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights to exploit their works and invention for a limited period..
- claim_2: Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Sponsor Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) said, Millions of American jobs hang in the balance, and our efforts to protect America's intellectual property are critical to our economy's long-term success..
    - Evidence 2: According to the review intellectual property (IP) policy is an increasingly important tool for stimulating economic growth..
    - Evidence 3: Many economists believe that, in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced, because there would be insufficient incentives for commercial organisations to produce them.
    - Evidence 4: In relation to computer software, the Business Software Alliance (BSA) claimed in its 2011 piracy study: Public opinion continues to support intellectual property (IP) rights: Seven PC users in 10 support paying innovators to promote more technological advances...
    - Evidence 5: A joint research project of the WIPO and the United Nations University measuring the impact of IP systems on six Asian countries found a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth..
- claim_3: Intellectual property rights protect against stealing.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Intellectual property rights (IPR) treat IP as a kind of real property, subject to analogous protections, rather than as a reproducible good or service..
    - Evidence 2: Operation In Our Sites is an initiative led by the NIPRCC to detect and hinder intellectual property violations on the Internet..
    - Evidence 3: WIPO was created in 1967 to encourage creative activity, to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world..

    - Evidence 5: Proponents say that copyright better preserves intellectual property like movies, music and television shows..
- claim_4: People, or a business, own their innovations and should be able to be compensated for their endeavour.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Free culture is a term derived from the free software movement, and in contrast to that vision of culture, proponents of open-source culture (OSC) maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers..
    - Evidence 2: Intellectual property rights (IPRs) - IPRs essential to implement the standard to be licensed to all applicants on a worldwide, non-discriminatory basis, either (1) for free and under other reasonable terms and conditions or (2) on reasonable terms and conditions (which may include monetary compensation)..
    - Evidence 3: By providing innovators with durable and tangible return on their investment of time, labor, and other resources, intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility..
    - Evidence 4: IP-intensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added (price minus material cost) per employee than non-IP-intensive industries.
    - Evidence 5: These exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated research and development costs..
","Opponents of the abolition of intellectual property rights believe that such rights incentivize creativity and innovation, promote investment in new products, prevent theft, and ensure rightful compensation for innovators. They argue that intellectual property rights are vital for economic growth and fostering innovation. This is substantiated by the World Intellectual Property Organization treaty and other international agreements, as well as the actions of the Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy in supporting the PRO-IP Act to protect American intellectual property and stimulate the job market. Opponents also state that intellectual property rights spur investment in developing new products. Supporting evidence includes the acknowledgment that intellectual property policy is a crucial tool for stimulating economic growth, as it provides commercial organizations with incentives to produce intangible assets. A joint research project by the WIPO and the United Nations University also demonstrated a positive correlation between the strengthening of intellectual property systems and subsequent economic growth. Furthermore, intellectual property rights are viewed as necessary protection against theft. Initiatives such as Operation In Our Sites led by the NIPRCC are cited as essential measures to detect and counter intellectual property violations on the Internet. Lastly, opponents argue that innovators deserve compensation for their endeavors, emphasizing that intellectual property rights secure a tangible return on their investment. This is demonstrated by the fact that IP-intensive industries are estimated to generate 72 percent more value added per employee than non-IP-intensive industries. Therefore, the exclusive rights granted by intellectual property laws provide a financial incentive and a means to cover associated research and development costs."

    - Evidence 2: Murray Rothbard argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain..
    - Evidence 3: Stallman argues that the term intellectual property is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of copyright, patent, trademark, and other laws by lumping together areas of law that are more dissimilar than similar..
    - Evidence 4: Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman argues that, although the term intellectual property is in wide use, it should be rejected altogether, because it systematically distorts and confuses these issues, and its use was and is promoted by those who gain from this confusion..
    - Evidence 5: Some critics of intellectual property, such as those in the free culture movement, point at intellectual monopolies as harming health (in the case of pharmaceutical patents), preventing progress, and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses, and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents..

    - Evidence 1: The duration increased from an average of 32.2 years to 95 (for copyrights owned by corporations) between 1974 and 2004, and it may yet be extended further, in violation of the constitutional requirement that the exclusive rights be for limited times.  The scope has increased from regulating only publishers to now regulating just about everyone..
    - Evidence 2: Lateef Mtima, director of the Institute for Intellectual Property and Social Justice at Howard University School of Law, expressed concern that users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable themselves, saying, Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the bill is that the conduct it would criminalize is so poorly defined..
    - Evidence 3: Professor Lessig analyzes the tension that exists between the concepts of piracy and property in the intellectual property realm in the context of what he calls the present depressingly compromised process of making law that has been captured in most nations by multinational corporations that are interested in the accumulation of capital and not the free exchange of ideas..

    - Evidence 3: Another unusual and criticized decision taken by Fleva (in his secondary capacity as Minister of Industry and Commerce) was the abolition of virtually all patents, measures justified by his belief that intellectual property rights were holding back industrialization. This policy, backed by a sizable portion of the public, was only repealed in 1906, under continued pressure from the international arms industry..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Advocates for the abolition of intellectual property rights posit a variety of claims. The first is that these rights hinder the continual improvement of services and products. They cite examples like the case of Fox Talbot, whose patent rights on photography were accused of stunting the field's development in 1852. Economists such as Murray Rothbard argue that intellectual property laws discourage innovation as improvements might infringe on existing patents, discouraging further research. The second claim is that intellectual property rights limit access to critical information and products. They note how the duration and scope of copyrights have drastically increased from an average of 32.2 years to 95 between 1974 and 2004. They argue that it's in violation of the constitutional requirement for such rights to be for limited times. Thirdly, they suggest that these rights are fundamentally unfair. The People's Health Movement, for example, considers the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement iniquitous and against the interest of developing countries and their citizens. Edwin Hettinger and Roderick T. Long argue that the philosophical tradition justifying property cannot guide us in thinking about intellectual property. Fourth, the advocates claim that intellectual property rights stifle creativity and innovation. An historical case cited is when a minister abolished virtually all patents, believing they held back industrialization. Petra Moser has also asserted that intellectual property laws might negatively impact innovation based on historical evidence. Fifth, they argue that these rights waste money. Bhagwati states that protecting intellectual property is merely a matter of royalty collection, and government-enforced monopolies, such as intellectual monopoly, create many social costs. Lastly, they argue that intellectual property rights are ineffective. They cite Tucker's argument that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot be held as property. Kinsella asserts that intellectual property rights can only be implemented by limiting others' physical property rights."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws.  A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes — and the results weren’t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1% obtained their firearms through a retail source..
    - Evidence 2: In 2018, a study was released that examined the effect of comprehensive background checks on the state. The study examined nearly two decades (1981-2000) of data and found that background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California..
    - Evidence 3: A study in Applied Economics Letters found that “assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level” and “states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gun-related murders.”.
    - Evidence 4: According to a Mar. 10, 2016 Lancet study, most state-level gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates, and, of 25 state laws, nine were associated with higher gun death rates..

    - Evidence 2: The U.S. Supreme Court revisited the issue in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 478 F.3d 370. The plaintiff in Heller challenged the constitutionality of a Washington D.C. law which prohibited the possession of handguns. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down the D.C. handgun ban as violative of that right. The Court meticulously detailed the history and tradition of the Second Amendment at the time of the Constitutional Convention and proclaimed that the Second Amendment established an individual right for U.S. citizens to possess firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court struck down a New York law requiring parties interested in purchasing a handgun for the use of self-defense outside of the home to obtain a license because the law issued licenses on a “may-issue” rather than a “shall issue” basis. This “may issue” licensing method allowed state authorities to deny interested parties public use licenses for firearms if the interested party was unable to show “proper cause” as to why they have a heightened need for self-protection over the general population..
    - Evidence 4: In a 5-4 vote Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of individual Americans to keep and bear arms. The court said gun ownership is an individual right, not connected with military service, and that it can be regulated in some ways..

    - Evidence 2: Daniel J. Schultz, lawyer, stated, “the Framers [of the Constitution and Bill of Rights] understood that ‘well-regulated’ militias, that is, armed citizens, ready to form militias that would be well trained, self-regulated and disciplined would post no threat to their fellow citizens, but would, indeed, help to ‘insure domestic Tranquility’ and ‘provide for the common defence.'.
    - Evidence 3: Constitutions in 37 US states protect the right to bear arms for self-defense, most with explicit language such as Alabama’s: 'every citizen has a right to bear arms in defense of himself and the state.'.
    - Evidence 4: A May 9, 2013 48% of convicted felons surveyed admitted that they avoided committing crimes when they knew the victim was armed with a gun..
    - Evidence 5: In a Gallup survey conducted in August 2019, gun owners were most likely to cite personal safety or protection as the reason they own a firearm. Roughly six-in-ten (63%) said this in an open-ended question..
","Opponents to the abolition of the right to bear arms assert a variety of arguments. Firstly, they claim that gun control is ineffective. Evidence such as a 2016 Obama administration study shows that criminals largely obtain firearms through illegal channels.

Secondly, they claim gun ownership as a fundamental right. They cite legal precedents such as the District of Columbia v.

Thirdly, they argue that gun ownership is essential for hunting and sport shooting. Pew Research reports that 32% of gun owners in 2013 owned guns for hunting, and 7% for sport shooting. Economic data shows substantial financial expenditure on hunting equipment. Fourthly, they believe gun ownership promotes self-protection.

    - Evidence 2: A study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that firearms were the second leading cause of deaths for children, responsible for 15% of child deaths compared to 20% in motor vehicle crashes..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a long-lasting increased risk of violent death”.
    - Evidence 4: Harvard professor David Hemenway, PhD, wrote 'We analyzed the relationship between homicide and gun availability using data from 26 developed countries from the early 1990s. We found that across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides.'.
    - Evidence 5: When US gun ownership goes down, overall suicide rates drop; meanwhile, each 10 percentage-point increase in gun ownership is linked to a 26.9% increase in the youth suicide rate..
- claim_2: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Jeffrey Voccola, Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University, notes, 'The average gun owner, no matter how responsible, is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle life-threatening situations, so in most cases, if a threat occurs, increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation.'.
    - Evidence 2: A June 1985 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that “the weapons used [in altercations]… were those closest at hand.”.
    - Evidence 3: An editorial published in the June 1985 American Journal of Public Health noted, “gun-inflicted deaths [often] ensue from impromptu arguments and fights; in the US, two-thirds of the 7,900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns.”.
    - Evidence 4: A 1993 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that '[r]ather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.'.
    - Evidence 5: 'On the absolute scale, this means that a state like California, which has approximately two mass shootings per year, will have an extra mass shooting for every 10 unit increase in permissiveness over five years,' explain the researchers. 'It will also have three to five more mass shootings per five years for every 10 unit increase in gun ownership,' they add..

    - Evidence 3: Ian Ayres, JD, PhD, and John J. Donohue, JD, PhD, Professors of Law at Yale Law School and Stanford Law School respectively, state, “with guns being a product that can be easily carried away and quickly sold at a relatively high fraction of the initial cost, the presence of more guns can actually serve as a stimulus to burglary and theft..
    - Evidence 4: According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics May 2013 report, 37.4% of state prison inmates who “used, carried, or possessed a firearm when they committed the crime for which they were serving a prison sentence” obtained the gun from a family member or friend..
    - Evidence 5: One of the worst recent examples was the massacre in a Sutherland Springs, Texas, church last November, in which 26 people were killed by a man whose domestic violence conviction should have barred him from buying guns..
- claim_4: Guns lead to accidental deaths.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths and “89% of unintentional shooting deaths of children occur in the home—and most of these deaths occur when children are playing with a loaded gun in their parents’ absence.”.
    - Evidence 2: Accidental gun deaths occur mainly to those under 25 years old. So far in 2022, 209 children (age 0-17) have died by gunshot and an additional 519 were injured. Adolescents are particularly susceptible to accidental shootings due to specific behavioral characteristics associated with adolescence, such as impulsivity, feelings of invincibility, and curiosity about firearms..
    - Evidence 3: In 2021, unintentional shooting deaths accounted for over 4% (2,007) of total gun related deaths (44,912) in the United States..
    - Evidence 4: A study from 2014 showed that victims of unintentional shootings were three times more likely to live in a household with a firearm..
    - Evidence 5: A 2001 study found that regardless of age, people are nine times more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns..
","The supporters of the motion 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms' base their argument on four primary claims: Claim 1 argues that banning guns would save lives. This is supported by data showing guns were the leading cause of death by homicide and suicide. Moreover, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that firearms were the second leading cause of child deaths, and another study associates the legal purchase of a handgun with an increased risk of violent death. Claim 2 maintains that gun ownership allows for mass shootings/general gun violence. Supporting evidence includes a study noting the increase in dangerous situations when more guns are present, and another suggesting that guns at home increase the risk of homicide by family members or intimate acquaintances. Claim 3 posits that guns can fall into the wrong hands, with evidence showing that many guns used in criminal acts initially enter circulation via legal transactions, and numerous instances where guns were stolen from homes or acquired from family or friends by those committing crimes. Claim 4 warns that guns lead to accidental deaths. According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and the National Physicians Alliance, states with the highest concentration of guns have nine times the amount of accidental gun deaths. Further evidence demonstrates the heightened risk of unintentional shootings for younger individuals, specifically those under 25."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Years of brutal cuts to public health services, following NHS reform legislation passed in 2012 which moved public health from the NHS to local authorities whose budgets were hit the hardest, had taken their toll..
    - Evidence 2: Nationally, local authority budgets were cut by nearly a third from 2010 to 2018, according to the UK National Audit Office and the public health grant fell by £700m in real terms between 2014/15 and 2019/20, as revealed by a Health Foundation report. Across society a decade was defined by the destruction of a safety net built over many years. From the closure of Sure Start centres and libraries to the crumbling estates and rocketing vacancy lists of NHS organisations – few public services were left unscathed..
    - Evidence 3: As Sir Michael’s landmark report in February, 10 years on from the Marmot review of 2010, said: ‘From rising child poverty and the closure of children’s centres, to declines in education funding, an increase in precarious work and zero hours contracts, to a housing affordability crisis and a rise in homelessness, to people with insufficient money to lead a healthy life and resorting to food banks in large numbers, to ignored communities with poor conditions and little reason for hope… Austerity will cast a long shadow over the lives of the children born and growing up under its effects.’.
    - Evidence 4: The UK’s largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has documented a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. In that decade this food bank network went from distributing just under 26,000 parcels a year to handing out more than 1.33 million of them..
    - Evidence 5: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
    - Evidence 3: For instance, interest rates on Greek debt fell following its first bailout. However, the gains were limited to the government having decreased interest rate expenses. Although the private sector was unable to benefit, the major beneficiaries of lower rates are large corporations. Consumers benefited only marginally from lower rates, but the lack of sustainable economic growth kept borrowing at depressed levels despite the lower rates..
    - Evidence 4: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
    - Evidence 5: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In an excoriating 24-page report, which will be presented to the UN human rights council in Geneva next year, the eminent human rights lawyer Philip Alston said that in the UK 'poverty is a political choice'..
    - Evidence 2: Philip Alston, the UN’s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, ended a two-week fact-finding mission to the UK with a stinging declaration that levels of child poverty were “not just a disgrace, but a social calamity and an economic disaster”, even though the UK is the world’s fifth largest economy,.
    - Evidence 3: Austerity Britain was in breach of four UN human rights agreements relating to women, children, disabled people and economic and social rights. “If you got a group of misogynists in a room and said how can we make this system work for men and not for women they would not have come up with too many ideas that are not already in place,” Philip Alston said..
    - Evidence 4: Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government should listen to the people being pushed into poverty by its policies. Universal credit is failing miserably, leaving families in debt, [in] rent arrears and at risk of becoming homeless. Three million children are growing up in poverty despite living in a working household..
    - Evidence 5: Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots – Denise Hunter, 57, at the West End food bank in Newcastle-on-Tyne.
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
    - Evidence 3: Because the evidence shows that austerity strangled the green shoots of economic recovery that were sprouting when the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition took office..
    - Evidence 4: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
    - Evidence 5: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers..
    - Evidence 2: Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%..
    - Evidence 3: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
    - Evidence 4: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
    - Evidence 5: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","The opponents of the stance 'We should adopt an austerity regime' put forth five key claims: Claim 1 asserts that austerity cuts access to essential services, using evidence such as the significant decrease in public health grants in the UK, the rising number of emergency food parcels distributed by food bank networks, and the harsh effect on child and family welfare budgets. Claim 2 holds that austerity extends recessions, with evidence pointing to the negative impact of austerity measures on economic downturns, the exacerbation of economic hardships, and the ineffectiveness of these measures in stimulating sustainable economic growth. Claim 3 argues that austerity is unfair to citizens. This claim is supported by a report from the UN human rights council that declared poverty as a political choice in the UK, citing the country's breach of four UN human rights agreements, and the increase in child poverty and economic disaster. Claim 4 states that austerity results in lower growth. Evidence includes Greece's experience where austerity measures, despite reducing the deficit, failed to rejuvenate the economy. It also highlights the suppressed tax revenues and the halving of pay growth across OECD countries post-crisis. Claim 5 argues that austerity results in lower job creation. It uses evidence such as the belief that cutting government spending leads to large-scale unemployment and the high unemployment rates experienced in European countries under austerity regimes. The International Labour Organisation reports indicate an increased probability of unemployment or vulnerable employment, especially for women."
We should adopt an austerity regime,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity improves the economic measures.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: For example, Canada in 1993-96, cut their fiscal deficit but maintained strong economic growth..
    - Evidence 2: More recently, supporters of austerity argue that the rebound in economic growth in Latvia and Estonia show that countries who pursue fiscal austerity can overcome their problems. (e.g. Latvia showed fast growth of 5.1% in past 12 months at Q1 2012).
    - Evidence 3: If budget deficits are not cut, it can lead to higher bond yields (e.g. in case of Greece, Spain and Ireland)..
    - Evidence 4: The measures implemented in 2010 achieved a remarkable degree of fiscal consolidation, bringing the Greece government deficit from 15.8% in 2009 to 10.7% in 2010..
    - Evidence 5: Contrary to this, research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina demonstrated the benefits of ‘expansionary austerity:’ fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 showed that spending cuts were often 'associated with economic expansions rather than recessions'..
- claim_2: Austerity is important in the long term.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting budget deficits will give investors greater confidence about the long-term performance of the economy. Lower debt levels will encourage the private sector to invest. In 2012, the EU commission produced a report saying that austerity measures are working to reduce budget deficits. José Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: ‘I can say the medicine is beginning to work’ (Economist). The EU point to falling deficits in countries such as Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Hungary has also improved its fiscal position..
    - Evidence 2: Some economists argue ‘austerity’ is necessary to reduce budget deficits, and cutting government spending is compatible with improving the long-term economic performance of the economy..
    - Evidence 3: If policymakers and the electorate show sufficient resolve, carrying through with austerity will eventually be rewarded by better financing conditions. Austerity pays off in the long run..
    - Evidence 4: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Austerity is important to increase stability.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Astute monetary policy and falls in international commodity prices are given by a recent World Bank overview, as reasons for this relatively steady growth in the services and industrial sectors, enjoyed by Morocco and reflected in the country’s GDP..
    - Evidence 2: Morocco was a heavily indebted country in the 1980s. Austerity measures and promarket reforms have been credited with positive outcomes, including economic stability, steady growth at low inflation rates, and a gradual fall in unemployment..
    - Evidence 3: A reduction in wages and public expenditure negatively impacts domestic demand. But this negative effect is offset by the positive effect on exports. A strong state commitment to macroeconomic stability and improved cost competitiveness improved the real exchange rate (REER) and facilitated an export-led recovery..
    - Evidence 4: Put simply, a growth in external demand (consumers outside Ireland buying more Irish produced goods and services) compensated for a contraction in the internal demand caused by austerity (Irish consumers, households and government spending less). It’s the German model of adjustment: commit to macroeconomic stability, compress domestic demand and expand exports..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Countries use austerity measures to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. That's when creditors become concerned that the country will default on its debt. It occurs when the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio is greater than 77%..
    - Evidence 2: That's the tipping point, according to a study by the World Bank. It found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth. Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the country 1.7% in economic growth..
    - Evidence 3: The Greek debt crisis led to a crisis in the eurozone. Many European banks had invested in Greek businesses and sovereign debt. Other countries, like Ireland, Portugal, and Italy, had also overspent. They took advantage of low-interest rates as eurozone members. The 2008 financial crisis hit these countries hard. As a result, they needed bailouts to keep from defaulting on their sovereign debt..
    - Evidence 4: Almost a decade after the onset of the global financial crisis, national debt in advanced economies remains near its highest level since World War II, averaging 104 percent of GDP. In Japan, the ratio is 240 percent and in Greece almost 185 percent. In Italy and Portugal, debt exceeds 120 percent of GDP. Without measures either to cut spending or increase revenue, the situation will only get worse..
    - Evidence 5: The most commonly proposed austerity measures in the IMF loans include wage bill cuts and freezes (31 countries), increases to or the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) (14 countries), and general public expenditure cuts (55 countries)..
- claim_5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Despite its negative reputation concerning its commitment to reforms and its implementation record, Greece has put forth an immense effort over the last three years and indeed has taken impressive steps toward achieving fiscal sustainability, with occasionally remarkable results. In the three years since the beginning of the crisis, it implemented a fiscal tightening of some 20% of GDP (around €50bn, while it has committed to measures cumulatively totalling €65bn by 2015) and reduced its budget deficit by an impressive nine percentage points, despite having lost a fifth of its GDP since 2009..
    - Evidence 2: For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 left many governments with reduced tax revenues and exposed what some believed were unsustainable spending levels. Several European countries, including the United Kingdom, Greece, and Spain, turned to austerity as a way to alleviate budget concerns..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the most successful model of austerity, at least in response to a recession, occurred in the United States between 1920 and 1921. The unemployment rate in the U.S. economy jumped from 4% to almost 12%.  Real gross national product (GNP) declined almost 20%—greater than any single year during the Great Depression or Great Recession. President Warren G. Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.

    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Proponents of austerity argue that such an economic policy can lead to improved economic measures, long-term stability, deficit reduction, and overall economic resilience during troubled times. Firstly, the claim that austerity improves economic measures is supported by evidence from multiple countries. Canada during 1993-96 successfully reduced its fiscal deficit while maintaining strong economic growth. Similarly, Latvia and Estonia showed promising economic growth after pursuing fiscal austerity. The case of Greece also exemplifies the ability of austerity measures to achieve significant fiscal consolidation. Research by Harvard economist Alberto Alesina also indicates that spending cuts were often associated with economic expansions, not recessions. The argument that austerity is important in the long term is supported by the assertion that reducing budget deficits can bolster investor confidence about the long-term performance of an economy. The European Union has found that austerity measures worked to reduce budget deficits in countries like Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg, Sweden, and Hungary. Additionally, by carrying through with austerity, policymakers will eventually be rewarded with better financing conditions. On the point of stability, austerity is believed to increase economic stability, with Morocco's steady growth and low inflation rates being attributed to its austerity measures and promarket reforms. Similarly, in Ireland, a contraction in internal demand caused by austerity was offset by an expansion in external demand, contributing to macroeconomic stability. Austerity is also deemed essential for reducing deficits or paying debts, with the World Bank suggesting a debt-to-GDP ratio greater than 77% as a tipping point for economic slowdown. Austerity measures are used to avoid a sovereign debt crisis, which was observed during the Greek debt crisis and the subsequent eurozone crisis. The IMF loans commonly propose austerity measures, including wage bill cuts, VAT increases, and general public expenditure cuts. Lastly, proponents argue that an austerity regime is especially important in economically troubled times. Despite the immense challenges, Greece implemented stringent austerity measures during the financial crisis and achieved impressive results in fiscal sustainability."

    - Evidence 2: As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film The Golden Compass, believing that while the religious elements of the film would be watered down from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says denigrates Christianity and promotes atheism for kids, citing author Philip Pullman as saying that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief..
    - Evidence 3: The report also criticized the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship; they have denounced our religion and our God as 'lies'..
    - Evidence 4: Article 37 of the Albanian Constitution of 1976 stipulated, The State recognises no religion, and supports atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in the people,  and the penal code of 1977 imposed prison sentences of three to ten years for religious propaganda and the production, distribution, or storage of religious literature..

    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights has found that a person cannot be forced to demonstrate views or behaviour associated with a particular religion. This means, for example, that public authorities should take care when using procedures that involve the swearing of oaths. A requirement to swear on a religious text, such as the Bible, would breach human rights law. An alternative form of affirmation should be available that isn’t connected with religion..
    - Evidence 3: Freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Opponents of adopting atheism argue on several fronts, including the violation of religious freedom, a lack of moral grounding, and the fundamental principle of personal choice. The claim that atheism discriminates against religious people or violates freedom of religion is supported by historical and contemporary examples. The philosopher John Locke argued that atheism could undermine social order and lead to chaos. More recently, the film 'The Golden Compass' was criticized for allegedly promoting atheism and undermining Christianity. Opponents also argue that atheism lacks a moral compass. Douglas Wilson, an evangelical theologian, posits that while atheists can behave morally, they cannot rationally explain why they should lead a morally responsible life without belief.Finally, opponents believe in the freedom to choose whether to adopt atheism. Rod Liddle argues that choosing to believe or not to believe in God is a personal decision with no definitive scientific proof. Furthermore, the European Court of Human Rights has declared that individuals cannot be forced to adopt particular religious or atheistic views, signifying the necessity of personal choice in religious beliefs. This freedom to practice one's beliefs is subject to limitations prescribed by law in the interests of public safety, public order, health, and morals, and for the protection of others' rights and freedoms."
We should adopt atheism,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: La Mettrie defended a purely pleasure-based view of the proper end of human life, and advocated atheism as the only means of liberating human beings from the various forms of oppression which stand in the way of human progress..
    - Evidence 3: Being an atheists often comes with contradictory ideologies that the society thrusts upon people but on the inside, atheists are free of conflicting ideas. They do not need to debate almost every time some stranger comments or offends any religion for they not believe in religion. They do not ever get into heated debates about which religion is better than the other..
    - Evidence 4: They believe in scientific explanations and do not dwell on mythologies that are most of the time impossible to believe in unless you are a blind follower. Their reasons and concepts are clear and they are happy about whatever they believe to be true. Satisfaction at heart is the most important thing people seek and atheism brings it in the most literary and non-mythical way..
    - Evidence 5: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A few years ago, in a conversation with fellow atheist Peter Boghossian, Richard Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
    - Evidence 3: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 4: Theodore Drange (2006)  has developed an argument that if God were the sort of being that wanted humans to come to believe that he exists, then he could bring it about that far more of them would believe than currently do.  God would be able, he would want humans to believe, there is nothing that he would want more, and God would not be irrational.  So God would bring it about that people would believe.  In general, he could have brought it about that the evidence that people have is far more convincing than what they have.  He could have miraculously appeared to everyone in a fashion that was far more compelling than the miracles stories that we have.  It is not the case that all, nearly all, or even a majority of people believe, so there must not be a God of that sort..
    - Evidence 5: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
    - Evidence 3: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
    - Evidence 4: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..

    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
    - Evidence 3: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
    - Evidence 4: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God. 'The world needs to wake up from the long nightmare of religion. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","The proponents of adopting atheism outline a multi-faceted argument. They suggest that atheism can be personally beneficial. Baggini asserts that atheism fosters a superior ethical basis, arguing that morality needs to exist independently of religious imperatives. La Mettrie advocates for atheism as the liberator of humans from oppressive ideologies, while other arguments emphasise the freedom and satisfaction atheists experience from being unbound by religious debates, dogma, and confusion. The proponents also argue that atheism should be adopted because the existence of God can't be definitively proven. Richard Dawkins, a renowned atheist, contends that no evidence could convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away. Similarly, atheist Michael Scriven states that atheism is the rational choice in the absence of any tangible evidence for God's existence. Further bolstering this claim, Theodore Drange and J.L. Schellenberg present arguments to the effect that if God truly wanted humans to believe in his existence, he would make it far more evident. The third line of argument focuses on the perceived immorality of religions. Critics claim that religion confuses obedience with morality, with one of the arguments being that if you are simply following a set of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Some assert that religion is intrinsically immoral because it is predicated on untruths. Furthermore, criticisms are levelled against specific religions, pointing to historical and contemporary wrongs as evidence of their immorality. Lastly, they argue that science can sufficiently explain the Universe. This is supported by claims that atheists or agnostics are more knowledgeable about religion than religious followers. Supporters of this claim often reference scientific achievements and advancements, like Darwin's theory of evolution, as an explanation for complex biological designs and as a counter to religious explanations of the Universe. Stephen Weinberg, a Nobel Prize winner, even suggests that weakening the hold of religion might be the greatest contribution scientists can make to civilization."
We should adopt libertarianism,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt libertarianism', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Libertarianism harms economic growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Carson coined the pejorative term vulgar libertarianism, a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality..
    - Evidence 2: In 2007, the environmentalist George Monbiot wrote an article in The Guardian connecting Ridley's libertarian economic philosophy and the ¬£27 billion failure of Northern Rock..
    - Evidence 3: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
    - Evidence 4: The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others..
    - Evidence 5: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
    - Evidence 3: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..

- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good..
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..

    - Evidence 2: As libertarians they believe that all secular governments exist to protect natural rights, and only to protect natural rights; and they believe that natural rights are necessarily defined in terms of private property, at least in the legal and political arena..
    - Evidence 3: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The government has a crucial role in protecting basic human rights such as freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. These rights are often enshrined in constitutional documents and are protected by laws and institutions that are enforced by the government. For example, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlights the importance of government protection of human rights, particularly for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
    - Evidence 2: The government also has a crucial role in protecting the environment, particularly in the absence of market-based solutions. For example, a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights the importance of government action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

","Critics suggest that the libertarian focus on free markets can sometimes defend corporate capitalism and economic inequality, as noted by Carson. They point to instances such as the £27 billion failure of Northern Rock as an outcome of libertarian economic philosophy. The authors Teles and Lindsey suggest that poor regulation can suppress economic growth and increase inequality. Critics like Hale and proponents of government intervention argue that the libertarian focus on laissez-faire capitalism ignores market failures and can lead to economic instability and inequality. Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off: Some opponents point out that libertarianism could theoretically allow for morally dubious practices like non-coercive enslavement contracts. Philosopher James P. Sterba argues that libertarianism should prioritize the liberty of the poor, suggesting that the rich should be required to sacrifice some of their wealth to meet the basic needs of the poor. Sterba further argues that a morally consistent application of libertarian principles requires equality in the distribution of goods and resources. Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal: Critics suggest that libertarianism can lead to unjust outcomes, such as the historical example of American slaveholders being coerced into freeing their slaves. Critics also argue that libertarian claims of trickle-down economic prosperity are not supported by empirical evidence, pointing to increased income inequality in many OECD countries. They suggest that the libertarian emphasis on individualism can lead to unjust outcomes and ignore the importance of social cooperation. Libertarianism removes essentia laws/infrastructure/government services: Critics argue that libertarians' belief in the legalization of victimless crimes and their focus on protecting natural rights defined by private property can have negative impacts. They note that libertarians often reject regulation and collective control, which can prevent effective responses to issues such as environmental degradation. The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens: Critics highlight the crucial role of government in protecting human rights and the environment. They point out that government institutions enforce laws protecting freedoms such as speech, religion, and assembly, and that government action is essential for mitigating the impacts of climate change."

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: For Gustav Landauer, propaganda of the deed meant the creation of libertarian social forms and communities that would inspire others to transform society..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians argue that a decrease in government intervention leads to increased freedom for individuals. By limiting the role of the government in society, individuals are able to make their own decisions about how to live their lives and pursue their own interests. For example, a study by the Cato Institute found that countries with lower levels of government intervention tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth.
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians also argue that protection of individual liberty is the central goal of political systems. By emphasizing individual freedom and property rights, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to pursue their own goals and interests. For example, philosopher Robert Nozick argues that individual rights and property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians also argue that increased freedom and competition lead to increased innovation and economic growth. By allowing individuals and businesses to freely pursue their own interests, a libertarian system can promote greater efficiency, innovation, and prosperity. For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.

    - Evidence 2: So why not prohibit alcohol .. I submit that there is only one why not, and this should be no news to libertarians who presumably believe in inalienable individual rights: namely, that no one has the right to coerce anyone not himself directly engaged in an overt act of aggression against rights..
    - Evidence 3: Rothbard's defense of the self-ownership principle stems from what he believed to be his falsification of all other alternatives, namely that either a group of people can own another group of people, or the other alternative, that no single person has full ownership over one's self. Rothbard dismisses these two cases on the basis that they cannot result in a universal ethic, i.e. a just natural law that can govern all people, independent of place and time. The only alternative that remains to Rothbard is self-ownership, which he believes is both axiomatic and universal..
    - Evidence 4: Sunstein and Thaler state that the libertarian aspect of our strategies lies in the straightforward insistence that, in general, people should be free to do what they like-and to opt out of undesirable arrangements if they want to do so..
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians support maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters..
","The discourse we embark upon today scrutinizes the adoption of libertarianism, a political philosophy advocating minimal state intervention in the life of citizens. Its proponents argue that libertarianism fosters economic growth, bolsters freedom in the political system, promotes happiness and fulfillment, and reinforces individual freedoms. Firstly, the advocates of libertarianism posit that this ideology fuels economic growth. The argument is substantiated by examples drawn from economics and sustainability. Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins, in their book Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, suggest that aspects of libertarianism can be merged with green politics to drive both economic and environmental progress. Additionally, libertarian proponents such as James Shikwati promote freedom of trade as a vital solution to poverty. The book 'Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution' by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins. The views of James Shikwati on trade freedom. Secondly, supporters assert that libertarianism amplifies freedom in the political system. The central idea is that decreased government intervention increases freedom for individuals. This is backed by studies such as that by the Cato Institute which found countries with lower government intervention levels have higher individual freedom and economic growth. Libertarian philosophers such as Robert Nozick and economists like James Buchanan affirm the fundamental importance of individual and property rights for a just and free society.Cato Institute's study on government intervention. Robert Nozick's and James Buchanan's theories on individual and property rights. Thirdly, it's argued that libertarianism enhances happiness and fulfillment. The ideology promotes laws that neither favor nor harm any race or sex, creating equal opportunities for all individuals. Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theory supports this claim, asserting that individuals derive the most happiness when engaged in fulfilling activities of their choice. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theory on individual happiness. The libertarian stance against laws favoring or harming any race or sex. Lastly, proponents argue that libertarianism bolsters individual freedom and liberties. They believe in self-ownership and oppose government bureaucracy, taxes, and infringement on personal rights. For instance, the philosophy of Rothbard, emphasizing self-ownership, supports this claim, dismissing all alternatives as inconsistent with a universal ethic. Rothbard's philosophy on self-ownership. Libertarian opposition to government bureaucracy and taxes, and promotion of private charity and diverse lifestyles. In summation, the advocates of libertarianism argue that the ideology, by advocating for minimal state intervention, enhances economic growth, freedom within the political system, personal happiness and fulfillment, and individual liberties. Its adoption, they propose, can usher in an era of prosperity, justice, and freedom."
We should ban human cloning,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
    - Evidence 3: Cloning can also be used to improve the quality of life for people with certain medical conditions. For example, cloning can be used to create replacement tissues for people with conditions like Parkinson's disease, which can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. A study by the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that transplantation of human stem cells can help to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease..
    - Evidence 4: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research. By creating human cells and tissues that are specific to an individual, researchers can better understand the effects of new treatments and drugs on human health. For example, a study by the National Institutes of Health found that human tissue cloning can help to reduce the need for animal testing..
    - Evidence 5: Cloning can also be used to advance medical research in a number of different areas. For example, cloning can be used to study the development of diseases and to develop new treatments for those diseases. A study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found that cloning can help to improve the understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's and to develop new treatments for those diseases..
- claim_2: Cloning helps those who can’t otherwise have a child.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents claim that human reproductive cloning also would produce benefits.
    - Evidence 2: One of the main arguments for not banning human cloning is that cloning can help those who are struggling with infertility. According to the World Health Organization, infertility affects about 10% of couples of reproductive age worldwide..
    - Evidence 3: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility..
    - Evidence 4: For example, cloning can be used to create a child who is genetically related to one of the parents. A study by the Journal of Medical Ethics found that cloning can help couples who are struggling with infertility.

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Courtney Campbell, director of the Program for Ethics, Science and the Environment at Oregon State University, says, Some traditions and leading figures in conservative Protestantism who were opposed to human cloning for reproductive reasons have come to see that given the ambiguity about their own views about the status of embryonic life, and given the potential for health benefits, they could be opposed to reproductive cloning, but affirm therapeutic cloning..
    - Evidence 2: For example, scientists could clone specific organs and use them to replace damaged or diseased organs in individuals. A study by the Lancet medical journal found that cloning could provide a source of organs for those in need of transplants..
    - Evidence 3: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic makeup of individuals with a particular disease and to develop therapies that target the underlying cause of the disease. A study by the Nature Genetics journal found that cloning could be used to develop gene therapies for a range of diseases..
    - Evidence 4: For example, scientists could use cloning to produce stem cells that could be used to treat a range of diseases. A study by the Nature journal found that cloning could greatly advance stem cell research..
    - Evidence 5: For example, scientists could use cloning to study the genetic basis of infertility and to develop new therapies to treat infertility. A study by the Fertility and Sterility journal found that cloning could be used to better understand the processes of reproduction..

    - Evidence 5: For example, cloning can be used to produce genetically modified organisms that can be used for a range of applications, such as producing new medicines and improving agricultural production. A study by the Nature Biotechnology journal found that cloning can help to advance biotechnology..
","Our opponents argue for banning human cloning, but let's consider the life-saving potential it holds. The World Health Organization reports a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation. Imagine a world where cloning could resolve this, creating customized organs specific to an individual's needs, reducing the risk of rejection and enhancing the success rate of transplantation. As affirmed by the American Journal of Transplantation, personalized transplantation can have a transformative impact on transplantation's success. Now, let's ponder on infertility. According to the World Health Organization, about 10% of couples of reproductive age worldwide struggle with infertility. Cloning can gift these couples a genetically related child, a blessing as shown by studies from the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics and the Journal of Medical Ethics. Additionally, the New England Journal of Medicine affirms that cloning can help reduce the transmission of genetic diseases. Moreover, human cloning can be instrumental in promoting health. Courtney Campbell, the director of the Program for Ethics, Science, and the Environment at Oregon State University, affirms this. According to a study by the Lancet medical journal, cloning could provide a source of organs for those in need of transplants. The Nature Genetics journal has revealed that cloning could develop gene therapies for various diseases. Last but not least, cloning could be a catalyst for scientific research. New Jersey's 2004 S1909/A2840 legislation and Missouri's 2006 Amendment Two testify to the importance of cloning in advancing stem cell research. The Journal of Medical Ethics and the Journal of Medical Science also highlight cloning's potential in advancing our understanding of diseases and their treatments."
We should ban human cloning,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
    - Evidence 3: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The National Council of Ethics of Portugal published its Opinion on the Ethical Implications of Cloning in 1997. The opinion states, the cloning of human beings, because of the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person, the equilibrium of the human species and life in society, is ethically unacceptable and must be prohibited..
    - Evidence 2: The basis for this justification is that reproductive human cloning necessarily infringes notions of human dignity..
    - Evidence 3: Through the act of creating another human being, Christians have also posed the question as to whether this would be too much like playing God. Not only this, but some Christian ethicists argue that human cloning would create substantial issues of identity and individuality.This could be seen through the confusion of the child resulting from cloning as to who his parents are, what connection he has to his genetic duplicate, etc..
    - Evidence 4: The Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and its Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Being appear to ban SCNT of human beings. Of the Council's 45 member states, the Convention has been signed by 31 and ratified by 18. The Additional Protocol has been signed by 29 member nations and ratified by 14..

    - Evidence 2: Scientists with experience in animal cloning have encountered low rates of success per implantation, where cloned fetuses are often malformed and dead before birth..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
    - Evidence 4: A study published in the journal Nature Biotechnology in 2005 found that cloning can result in genetic mutations that may cause long-term health problems and reduced lifespan..
    - Evidence 5: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2008 reported that cloning may result in unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences for the health of the cloned organism..
","The proponents of banning human cloning argue that we do not yet fully understand cloning's implications. Philosopher Leon Kass believes that the public's repugnance towards cloning human beings may be a deep wisdom beyond reason's power to fully articulate. He warns us not to transgress what is profoundly unspeakable. Furthermore, we must consider the ethical and religious implications of human cloning. Portugal's National Council of Ethics believes the cloning of human beings is ethically unacceptable due to the problems it raises concerning the dignity of the human person. Even Pope John Paul II has declared the techniques involved in cloning, which involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, as not morally acceptable. The argument against cloning continues with its unnatural essence. Rev. Demetri Demopulos, a Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist, opposes human cloning as it disrupts the natural order of procreation and fosters a culture of self-love. Finally, let's consider the safety concerns associated with cloning. Dr. Phil Noguchi of the FDA warns that human cloning risks transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newborn child. Studies published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics and Nature Biotechnology have reported low success rates, malformations, and premature deaths in cloned animals, highlighting the potential dangers involved in human cloning."

","The opponents of the banning of private military companies put forth four main claims.  Private military companies (PMCs) offer financial benefits. A report by the Congressional Research Service (2009) and a study in Defense and Security Analysis (2011) indicate that PMCs result in cost savings and provide efficient services compared to traditional military personnel. Furthermore, the RAND Corporation (2013) and the Heritage Foundation (2010) both argue that PMCs provide access to specialized skills and offer greater flexibility in personnel deployment, while a study in International Affairs (2010) suggests PMCs can streamline decision-making processes. PMCs are well-trained and better equipped. Evidence from the Heritage Foundation (2010) and the RAND Corporation (2013) suggests that PMCs require high levels of training and have access to advanced technology. Additionally, Defense and Security Analysis (2011) shows that PMCs often utilize state-of-the-art equipment, while International Affairs (2010) notes their expertise in unconventional warfare. PMCs can supplement regular armies in tasks the latter are unable or unwilling to do. Evidence from International Affairs (2010), the Heritage Foundation (2010), and the RAND Corporation (2013) argue that PMCs provide expertise in unconventional warfare, logistical support, and security functions that allow regular armies to focus on their primary missions. The Senate Armed Services Committee (2007) also highlights that PMCs can carry out sensitive, covert operations. PMCs increase safety. Defense and Security Analysis (2011) and the RAND Corporation (2013) suggest that PMCs provide improved security in conflict zones and deploy advanced technology to ensure operations safety. The Heritage Foundation (2010) asserts that PMCs can lead to more efficient resource use and can improve overall safety by providing support services."

","Supporters of the banning of PMCs present five main arguments. PMCs are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes. Human Rights Watch (2007) and the Congressional Research Service (2010) cite evidence of human rights violations and unlawful killings by PMCs, including the use of child soldiers as reported by the United Nations (2004). A study in the Journal of Business Ethics (2008) argues that PMCs can face ethical conflicts when serving their clients versus society at large. PMCs lack professionalism. Reports by Human Rights Watch (2006) and Amnesty International (2009) argue that PMCs often operate with limited accountability and transparency, leading to violations of international humanitarian law. Studies in International Affairs (2010) and Congressional Research Service (2009) note issues with unclear chains of command and hiring of poorly trained personnel. PMCs cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country. Evidence from the Congressional Research Service (2012), the Journal of Military Ethics (2009), and the Project on Government Oversight (2008) suggest that PMCs often prioritize contractual obligations over national loyalty, leading to potential conflicts of interest and mistrust. PMCs prioritize profit over ethical considerations. Human Rights Watch (2006), International Affairs (2010), and Amnesty International (2009) suggest that PMCs prioritize profit, often with limited accountability. The Project on Government Oversight (2008) and the International Peace Institute (2006) argue that the lack of industry regulation allows PMCs to put profit over other considerations. PMCs can encourage or prolong conflict. Reports from the Project on Government Oversight (2008), the International Peace Institute (2006), and Amnesty International (2009) argue"

","Ladies and gentlemen, imagine a child nurtured with a dream to act, a dream instilled by their parents and shaped by the world of celebrity culture. A 2014 study in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence affirms that parents significantly influence children's career aspirations. Furthermore, the Journal of Popular Culture in 2013 notes that celebrity culture impacts children's career choices, including acting. What if we take away the opportunity for these children to pursue their dreams? As the Drama Teachers Association of America noted in 2011, some children possess a natural talent for acting. The American Psychological Association also found in 2010 that acting allows children to express their emotions, further contributing to their interest in the performing arts. Consider the example of Ashwin Chitale, who found success and confidence at a young age and even won the best child artist award. On a broader perspective, child actors play a critical role in films and theatre. As reported by the National Association of Theatre Owners in 2013 and highlighted in the Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism in 2016, children bring diversity and help convey crucial themes in stories. The Actors Equity Association in 2014 pointed out that child actors increase audience engagement and widen the appeal of the production. However, we agree that there must be strict supervision and regulation. Child actors should be given adequate protection, including securing entertainment work permits, as required by law. Lastly, let's remember the sanctity of family decision-making authority. As emphasized by a Journal of Medical Ethics study in 2005 and reports by the Heritage Foundation (2008) and the United Nations (2015), parents should be the ones to make the best decisions for their children."

    - Evidence 2: Many child actors find themselves struggling to adapt as they become adults..
    - Evidence 3: There are many instances of troubled adult lives due to the stressful environment to which child actors are subjected..
    - Evidence 4: Anissa Jones, of Family Affair fame, overdosed on August 28, 1976 at age 18.   Jonathan Brandis, who appeared in a number of films as a child and teenager, committed suicide in 2003 at the age of 27 due to reasons possibly related to his lack of continued success into adulthood..
    - Evidence 5: Herbert was always happiest and at his best when he was performing. A talented actor, he felt secure and confident when the cameras rolled, but like many child actors, he faced difficulties adjusting to the real world beyond the controlled environment inside the studio walls. The career of a child actor often creates a profoundly troubling lack of identity at a difficult time, just after he has lost his commercial value with the onset of puberty..
","Ladies and gentlemen, while we value dreams and aspirations, we must not forget the harmful impact acting has on a child's education. As revealed by a study in the Journal of Education and Practice in 2013, child actors often miss out on school and receive inadequate education. The American Academy of Pediatrics in 2009 found that this could lead to developmental and emotional difficulties, causing long-term negative effects. Moreover, child actors are often exploited, as seen in several scenes depicting child actors at odds with labor laws. The U.S. Department of Labor report in 2018 and a study in the Journal of Adolescence in 2012 alarmingly noted that child actors face wage theft, lack of breaks, and poor working conditions. What's more tragic is the loss of childhood among these young performers. As UNICEF's 2016 report and various studies indicate, child actors often spend most of their time working and rehearsing, leaving them with little to no time for normal childhood activities. The pressure on these children is enormous. Tight production schedules and high-stress environments can have severe emotional impacts on child performers, leading to mental health issues like depression and anxiety, as reported by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network in 2010. Most worrying are the problems that manifest later in life, as evidenced by the struggles faced by several former child actors. The career of a child actor often results in a troubling lack of identity when puberty strikes, leading to a deep-rooted crisis. It's high time we consider the implications and reassess the role of child actors in our society."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
    - Evidence 2: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 3: High-Value Enemy Combatant Defined.--In this section, the term  ``high-value enemy combatant'' means an enemy combatant who--(1) is a senior member of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group; (2) has knowledge of an imminent terrorist threat against the United States or its territories, the Armed Forces of the United States, the people or organizations of the United States, or an ally of the United States;  (3) has, or has had, direct involvement in planning or preparing a terrorist action against the United States or an ally of the United States or in assisting the leadership of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group in  planning or preparing such a terrorist action; or (4) if released from detention, would constitute a clear and continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the United States..

    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..

    - Evidence 4: nan.

- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is essential to gain intelligence.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
    - Evidence 3: “The president has been really explicit ... that Gitmo is a very, very important tool,” Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said on Fox News this morning. It's also important to understand that Guantanamo Bay is an incredibly important intelligence asset..
    - Evidence 4: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..
    - Evidence 5: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..
","Ladies and Gentlemen,  I rise today to stand against the motion to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. I assert that the closure would present two primary risks: a significant threat to our national security and a compromising shift in the treatment of detainees. On the point of national security, let me remind you that there are currently 80 hardened and unrepentant terrorists detained in Guantanamo Bay. The relocation of these detainees could directly risk America's national security. The director of National Intelligence reported that approximately 17.5% of former Guantanamo detainees have reengaged in terrorist activities after being transferred. We must consider these alarming numbers. Furthermore, the detainees include high-value enemy combatants with intimate knowledge of imminent threats to our country and those who, if released, would pose clear and ongoing threats. Our next point of contention is the humane treatment of prisoners. Contrary to popular belief, the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a state-of-the-art facility providing humane treatment to all detainees and exceeding the standards of any maximum-security prison in the world. The International Committee of the Red Cross, human rights organizations, and Attorney General Holder can attest to this. Moreover, its isolated location ensures maximum security and presents various levels of confinement opportunities based on detainee compliance. Lastly, Guantanamo Bay is an unparalleled asset for gathering intelligence. It was strategically designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in our war on terror. It provides us an unprecedented opportunity to understand the inner workings of Al Qaeda and other such organizations. Top-ranking officials like Sebastian Gorka and Leon Panetta have emphasized the indispensability of Guantanamo Bay in collecting life-saving intelligence. We cannot overlook this critical function in our fight against global terrorism."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241..
    - Evidence 3: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
    - Evidence 4: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
    - Evidence 2: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 3: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
    - Evidence 4: Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad..
    - Evidence 5: The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
    - Evidence 3: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued C.I.A. presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined..
    - Evidence 2: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
    - Evidence 3: The cost of running Guantanamo Bay's prison and court system jumped by nearly $90 million from 2013 to 2018, even as the number of prisoners there has decreased. That is according to a new analysis from Carol Rosenberg at The New York Times..
    - Evidence 4: Simply by transferring the 84 detainees already cleared to leave Guantanamo, the United States could save nearly $2 billion over the next 10 years..
    - Evidence 5: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: On December 2, 2002, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld approved various harsh techniques, including: “interrogator identity” (interrogator impersonates a citizen or interrogator from a country known for harsh treatment of prisoners); stress positions, such as standing, for up to four hours; isolation for up to 30 days, with extensions beyond 30 days upon Commanding General approval; deprivation of all light and auditory stimuli; hooding during transportation and questioning; 20-hour interrogations; the use of a prisoner’s individual phobias, such as fear of dogs, to induce stress; and light pushing..
    - Evidence 2: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
    - Evidence 3: The CSRT applies a broad definition of enemy combatant that inevitably ensnares innocent people;  applies a presumption of guilt;  has no juries; disables prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence;  prohibits prisoners from having lawyers;   and relies on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely..
    - Evidence 4: A government report describes the facility as having been “modified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,” with doors that had been “sealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.” Inside, the walls were “covered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.” There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound..
    - Evidence 5: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
","Respected audience, we stand today to argue for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, advocating for the detainees' right to trial, the impact on the US's international image, and the unjust practices that have been prevalent. Firstly, we need to uphold the principles of our justice system. The U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Boumediene v. Bush, has already ruled that detainees have rights under the Constitution's habeas corpus provision to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts. We cannot let this landmark ruling be undermined. Our nation's reputation and commitment to the rule of law are at stake. Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantanamo’s negative impact on our nation’s reputation and national security. Its existence has been a blot on our reputation and served as a recruiting tool for terrorists. Leaders from organizations like Human Rights First have explicitly said that Guantanamo has long tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights. Moreover, Guantanamo Bay stands as a symbol of racial and religious injustice. Its existence shatters lives, shreds this country’s reputation in the world, and compromises national security. It has become a worldwide symbol of oppression, harming our international standing. Not only is Guantanamo a moral and strategic failure, but it's also a financial burden on the taxpayers. The annual cost of $540 million does not even include classified expenses. With only 40 prisoners currently housed, we are spending approximately $13 million per prisoner per year. Finally, we must address the human rights violations taking place within Guantanamo Bay. The treatment of prisoners has often crossed the line into abuse and even torture. Reports of sexual humiliation, physical abuse, and other inhumane practices cannot be ignored. Moreover, the tactics employed during detention and interrogation are starkly unjust, often entailing the use of coercive methods and denial of a fair trial."
We should end affirmative action,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should end affirmative action', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Affirmative action boosts diversity.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Scott Plous, PhD, Professor of Psychology at Wesleyan University, wrote in his article “Ten Myths About Affirmative Action,” posted on his website: 'Several studies have documented important gains in racial and gender equality as a direct result of affirmative action.'.
    - Evidence 2: Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, told CBS News, 'If we as a nation are serious about creating equity and justice, we have to institute programs that have been proven to create more equity in our schools, in our colleges, and our workplaces.' He added, 'Affirmative action programs in education have been demonstrated to increase diversity and increase access specifically for underrepresented groups.'.
    - Evidence 3: For example, one study found that students of color experience a 23 percentage point decline in likelihood of admission to highly selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban goes into effect..
    - Evidence 4: Nearly 70 major US companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, General Electric Co., and JetBlue Airways Corp. warned in a brief to the court that without affirmative action they’ll lose access to “a pipeline of highly qualified future workers and business leaders” — and will struggle to meet diversity hiring goals they’ve set..
    - Evidence 5: By the end of his tenure, UC was admitting more minority students than it was in 1997, the year before the ban on affirmative action took effect..
- claim_2: Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Barack Obama, JD, 44th President of the United States, provided the following statement on affirmative action to the NAACP “2008 Voter Action Center,”: 'I support affirmative action. When there is strong evidence of prolonged and systemic discrimination by organizations, affirmative action may be the only meaningful remedy available.'.
    - Evidence 2: Affirmative action itself has been defined as 'any measure, beyond simple termination of a discriminatory practice, adopted to correct or compensate for past or present discrimination or to prevent discrimination from recurring in the future.' (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Statement on Affirmative Action, October 1977.).
    - Evidence 3: These programs have brought or accompanied significant gains for women and minorities. In the past 25 years, black participation in the work force has increased 50 percent and the percentage of blacks holding managerial positions has jumped fivefold. In 1970, women comprised only 5 percent of lawyers compared to 20 percent today. Twenty-five years ago, the student population at University of California, Berkeley, was 80 percent white compared to 45 percent today..
    - Evidence 4: In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson delivered a speech to the graduating class at Howard, where he outlined his plans for civil rights legislation and endorsed aggressive affirmative action to combat the effects of years of segregation of blacks from the nation's economic opportunities [REF]..
    - Evidence 5: The justification for affirmative action is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture,[REF] and to address existing discrimination [REF]..
- claim_3: Affirmative action reduces discrimination.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The National Organization for Women (NOW) stated the following in its article 'Talking About Affirmative Action,':'Affirmative Action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95% to 97% of the high-level corporate jobs. And that’s with affirmative action programs in place. Imagine how low figures would be without affirmative action.'.
    - Evidence 2: Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve a range of goals: bridging inequalities in employment and pay; increasing access to education; enriching state, institutional, and professional leadership with the full spectrum of society; redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances, in particular addressing the apparent social imbalance left in the wake of slavery and slave laws..
    - Evidence 3: The government claimed that this was an affirmative action scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education..
    - Evidence 4: Affirmative action - provide positive preferential treatment in allotment of jobs and access to higher education, as a means to accelerate the integration of the SCs and STs with mainstream society..
    - Evidence 5: Similarly, Johnson v. Transportation Agency 480 U.S. 616 (1987), upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan to correct a 'manifest imbalance' demonstrated by statistical evidence in the representation of minorities and women in traditionally segregated job categories..
","Ladies and Gentlemen, we stand today to strongly object to the proposition of ending affirmative action, arguing from three pivotal standpoints: affirmative action boosts diversity, it compensates for the past, and it reduces discrimination. Let's first discuss diversity. Several studies, including those noted by Scott Plous, Professor of Psychology at Wesleyan University, have shown the important gains in racial and gender equality as a direct result of affirmative action. Ibram X. Kendi, director of the Boston University Center of Antiracist Research, echoed this sentiment, underlining the effectiveness of affirmative action programs in increasing diversity and access for underrepresented groups. This is further supported by research indicating a substantial 23 percentage point decline in admission rates for students of color at selective public colleges after an affirmative action ban. Many major US companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, General Electric Co., and JetBlue Airways Corp. have expressed concern about losing access to a pipeline of highly qualified future workers and leaders without affirmative action. Our second argument revolves around the compensatory role of affirmative action. As articulated by Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, affirmative action serves as a meaningful remedy for prolonged and systemic discrimination. This viewpoint is upheld by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, defining affirmative action as a means to correct past or present discrimination and prevent its recurrence. The impact of these programs is evident in the significant gains for women and minorities in workforce participation and educational representation over the past decades. Our third stance emphasizes affirmative action's role in reducing discrimination. The National Organization for Women has highlighted how affirmative action levels the playing field, ensuring that women and people of color have a fair chance to compete in education and business. Support for affirmative action across the globe aligns with these goals of bridging inequalities, increasing access to education, and redressing apparent past wrongs."

    - Evidence 2: While this system may seem helpful at diversifying campuses on the surface, it is simply putting a Band-Aid on systematic issues..
    - Evidence 3: Affirmative action is peak performative activism, as it focuses on making schools look more appealing than actually making sure marginalized communities are getting equal opportunities..
    - Evidence 4: This agenda is celebrated on the backs of Asian-American students.

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, mentioned : 'When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations, the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. ‘Affirmative action’ programs that leap-frog less-qualified minorities over more-qualified non-minorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such, race-based affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.'.
    - Evidence 2: Williams believes programs such as affirmative action and minimum wage laws set up to aide minorities have, in fact, been harmful to them and stifled their ability to advance in society..
    - Evidence 3: Some opponents[REF] further claim that affirmative action has undesirable side-effects and that it fails to achieve its goals..
    - Evidence 4: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job. Just because BIPOC students are getting into a university, doesn't necessarily mean they are being equipped with the tools they need to succeed in that university..
    - Evidence 5: For example, according to data released by the University of Texas in connection with Fisher, the mean SAT scores (out of 2400) and mean high-school grade-point averages (on a 4.0 scale) varied widely by race for the entering class of 2009. For Asians, the numbers were 1991 and 3.07; whites were at 1914 and 3.04; Hispanics at 1794 and 2.83; and African-Americans at 1524 and 2.57. The SAT scores for the Asian students placed them in the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT-takers nationwide; the African-American students, meanwhile, were at the 52nd percentile..
","Ladies and Gentlemen, we argue in favor of ending affirmative action today, bringing forth five key points: affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities, is ineffective, is not just, perpetuates prejudice, and reduces quality. Firstly, let's consider the diminishing of achievements. Connerly argues that affirmative action implies preferential treatment over merit and devalues the accomplishments of minorities. This sentiment is further amplified by studies that indicate a perceived devaluation of minority achievements due to affirmative action, as exemplified in Li's civil rights complaint against Princeton. Next, we contend that affirmative action is ineffective. Cases like Arizona's Proposition 107 illustrate the public's skepticism about affirmative action. The divide between privileged and less-skilled African Americans underscores the limited effectiveness of such policies in promoting social equity. The third argument is the unjust nature of affirmative action. We propose that it's a superficial solution to a deeper problem within the American education system. It prioritizes image over ensuring equal opportunities for marginalized communities, demonstrated by lawsuits against Harvard University for capping Asian American admissions. Fourthly, affirmative action is seen to perpetuate prejudice. Opponents label it as 'reverse discrimination', illustrated by Sweden's Supreme Court ruling that ethnic quotas are discriminatory. Moreover, affirmative action has been criticized for promoting biases against high-performing minorities, as noted in the ongoing Harvard lawsuit. Lastly, we argue that affirmative action reduces quality. Clint Bolick, JD, Director of the Goldwater Institute, suggested that affirmative action programs that prioritize race over merit might obscure systemic problems and, hence, are a disservice to the very groups they aim to help. This is underpinned by the discrepancy in graduation rates and academic performance among different racial groups in higher education, indicating the inefficiency of affirmative action in equipping minority students with necessary tools for success."

Secondly, the opponents argue that mandatory retirement benefits those about to retire. They reference a report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, which found that mandatory retirement can increase financial security for workers. Workers can rely on receiving pension benefits and other retirement benefits at a set age, helping them prepare and plan for their retirement."

","Supporters of ending mandatory retirement present five key arguments. Firstly, they argue that mandatory retirement decreases institutional knowledge, using examples such as Air Traffic Controllers in the UK and Commercial airline pilots in the US, where there are no or increased retirement age limits. Successful business practices, like those of Greene, are also cited as evidence, as he implemented policies barring mandatory retirement age at his manufacturing facility. Secondly, the argument posits that mandatory retirement harms the economy. Several studies by the OECD, NBER, ILO, and the World Economic Forum, suggest that mandatory retirement decreases labor force participation, reduces productivity, leads to inefficient use of human capital, and impedes workforce diversity. Thirdly, mandatory retirement is seen as unfair or discriminatory, leading to age discrimination, disregard for individual circumstances, impaired life satisfaction, limited earning potential, and decreased sense of purpose as supported by studies and reports from AARP, ILO, WHO, NBER, and the Harvard Business Review. Fourthly, it's argued that mandatory retirement reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire. This argument is backed by scholarly articles in The American Economic Review, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, Journal of Gerontology, and The Gerontologist. These studies suggest that mandatory retirement results in health declines, decreased economic well-being, reduced psychological well-being, decreased physical and cognitive function, and decreased social connections. Finally, they argue that everyone should be allowed to retire when they are ready. Studies by the World Health Organization, the Harvard Business Review, the International Labour Organization, AARP, and the World Economic Forum support the claim that retiring when one is ready promotes well-being, supports individual choice, maintains older workers' skills, supports active aging, and reduces the risk of poverty in old age."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Deterrence is a strategy that seeks to prevent an actor from taking specific action, and has been central to keeping peace for nearly 70 years..
    - Evidence 2: The invasion of Ukraine did not signal the failure of nuclear deterrence, as that country was not covered by any nuclear umbrella. On the contrary, it confirmed that countries that are not protected by deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are protected by deterrence remain safe from a major, frontal military attack. The possession of nuclear weapons by NATO and Russia bounds the horizon of conflict between them: the West does not intervene in Ukraine; Moscow spares their territory..

","Opponents argue that nuclear weapons serve a critical function of protection and deterrence.  Nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence. The essence of deterrence, a strategy that has been maintaining peace for approximately 70 years, is presented as crucial evidence. They also highlight the case of Ukraine's invasion, which doesn't signify the failure of nuclear deterrence but rather affirms it. Ukraine wasn't shielded by any nuclear umbrella, implying that countries not under deterrence can suffer such a fate, while those that are remain safe from a significant, direct military attack. Therefore, the opponents see nuclear weapons as a necessary evil that ensures a balance of power and mitigates the risk of major conflicts."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, said Deepti Choubey, senior director of nuclear and bio-security at the Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington. These are the materials that a terrorist would use to make a kind of bomb that you would use for nuclear terrorism attacks and they are currently spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world..
    - Evidence 2: Bart Dal, adviser for nuclear security and safeguards at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said terrorism had increased since September 2011 – meaning the whole nuclear world has to improve security. “Imagine what the effect would be if they [terrorists] succeeded,” he said. “The consequences are so large that we have to take this into account. If you expose a nuclear weapon in one city or more, that would change our lives forever.”.
    - Evidence 3: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 4: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
    - Evidence 5: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..

    - Evidence 1: On 21 September 2022, Mr Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” of Russian citizens to serve in the war in Ukraine. He also accused NATO members of making statements about “the possibility and admissibility of using weapons of mass destruction—nuclear weapons—against Russia”. He threatened to escalate the conflict if, in defence of Ukraine, any attacks were launched on Russian territory: In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff..
    - Evidence 2: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 3: More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and other NATO countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a single nuclear warning shot, according to a terrifying simulation..
    - Evidence 4: Max Tegmark: Soviet Sub Captain Decides to Fire Nuclear Torpedo During Cuban Missile Crisis To me, this is both harrowing and educational: it shows how great risk can come from the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings that couldn’t start a nuclear war on their own, but can provide the perfect storm when combined. The fact that it remained secret for decades also suggests that there may be recent scary incidents that we haven’t yet heard of..
    - Evidence 5: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
","Supporters of the abolition of nuclear weapons present several key arguments that highlight the dangers of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands. They cite evidence of the significant quantity of weapons-usable nuclear material that exists worldwide and could potentially be exploited for nuclear terrorism. They also emphasize the increase in terrorism since September 2011, suggesting an elevated risk of nuclear material being misused. The rise of terrorist groups such as Isis claiming the potential to obtain nuclear weapons further compounds this risk. Beyond intentional misuse, there are other risks, including the possibility of an irresponsible leader, theft by a terrorist organization, potential cyber threats to nuclear command, and unexpected mental health issues affecting those with access to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action. Supporters use recent conflicts, like the mobilization of Russian citizens for the war in Ukraine and the subsequent threats involving nuclear weapons, as examples. They point to the potential catastrophic impact of nuclear warfare, citing estimates from a potential Soviet nuclear attack that would have resulted in hundreds of millions of deaths. Furthermore, they point to simulations predicting over 91 million casualties within three hours of a nuclear warning shot. The Cuban Missile Crisis is used as an example to demonstrate how nuclear tensions can escalate rapidly due to unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings. They argue that similar flare-ups in tensions in the future may not end as luckily as the Cuban Missile Crisis. In conclusion, supporters strongly advocate for the abolition of nuclear weapons, citing the massive risks they pose to global security and human life. On the other hand, opponents argue that nuclear weapons play an essential role in maintaining peace and deterring major conflicts."

- claim_1: Cities offer more opportunities.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Migration to urban areas is usually motivated by the hope of better lives..
    - Evidence 2: Deficient urban planning, densely Urbanization creates enormous social, economic and environmental changes, which provide an opportunity for sustainability with the 'potential to use resources more efficiently, to create more sustainable land use and to protect the biodiversity of natural ecosystems.’ condensed urbanization, and poverty are ongoing problems..
    - Evidence 3: A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities..
    - Evidence 4: With new investments in these areas and associated development strategies, planners anticipate increased urbanization of Sihanoukville, alongside growing economic opportunities that will lead to migration from rural areas..
    - Evidence 5: During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: 12th century western Europe brought renewed focus on urbanisation as a means of stimulating economic growth and generating revenue..
    - Evidence 2: Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city..
    - Evidence 3: New government policies encouraged the privatisation of agriculture, the wholesale urbanisation of China's rural population, the development of tens of thousands of small-scale rural industries and an influx of international investment..
    - Evidence 4: For example, they argue that industrialization supports greater efficiency of agriculture through technology, an advantage for the productivity of rural farmers as well as urban consumers..
    - Evidence 5: Even in the case of overurbanization, some of the positive effects of urbanization could be present in regards to economic growth, such as the development of more efficient economics due to scale, technological developments, diversity of both products and occupations, as well as the greater opportunity of occupational and social mobility and greater readiness to adapt..
- claim_3: Urbanization benefits the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Biodiversity will play an increasingly important role within the urban landscape..
    - Evidence 2: Urbanization brings higher productivity because of its positive externalities and economies of scale. Asian urban productivity is more than 5.5 times that of rural areas. The same output can be produced using fewer resources with urban agglomeration than without. In this sense, urbanization reduces the ecological footprint..
    - Evidence 3: Urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies. In the long term, environment-friendly equipment, machines, vehicles, and utilities will determine the future of the green economy..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Opponents of the motion believe that urbanization is not a force to be combated but rather a societal change to be embraced for its numerous benefits. Their first claim is that cities offer more opportunities. Migrants are usually driven to urban areas by the prospect of better lives. Evidence of this is seen in historical events like the migration of people from rural areas to metropolitan areas in Japan during its 20th-century economic development, driven by the promise of better jobs and education. It's also evident in Sihanoukville, where new investments are predicted to lead to growing economic opportunities and migration from rural areas. Their second claim is that urbanization is beneficial to the economy. Evidence from 12th-century Western Europe shows that urbanization can stimulate economic growth and generate revenue. Also, unplanned urbanization during Manchester's Industrial Revolution resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialized city. This line of thought is echoed in China's recent urbanization policies that have led to economic development through industrialization and international investment. Lastly, they claim that urbanization benefits the environment. Biodiversity, for example, can flourish in an urban landscape. The economies of scale that result from urban agglomeration can result in higher productivity and the same output produced using fewer resources, thereby reducing the ecological footprint. Furthermore, urbanization drives innovation, including green technologies which are crucial for a sustainable future."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The continuation of the economic decline combined with the increased population and urbanization led to decrease of agrarian production..
    - Evidence 2: Venezuela's rural areas have seen substantial economic disinvestment, governmental neglect, depopulation, and abandonment ever since oil wealth was discovered in the early 20th century; as a consequence Venezuela now has an urbanization rate of more than 85%-among the highest in Latin America-and is, despite its vast tracts of highly fertile soil and arable land, a net food importer..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Urbanization harms the environment.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: As internal migration by farmers looking for better-paying jobs in urban hubs causes a significant rural-urban inequality gap (the owners of firms would be profiting, while laborers from those industries would see their incomes rise at a much slower rate and agricultural workers would possibly see their incomes decrease), rural populations decrease as urban populations increase..
    - Evidence 2: The rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization are associated with a strong increase in energy demand and emissions of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide (see also acid rain) and hydrogen sulfide, which may affect plant metabolism..
    - Evidence 3: Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural activities largely contribute sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers..
    - Evidence 4: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
    - Evidence 5: A specific concern is urbanization, which affects water quality by increasing its load of metals and organic contaminants..
- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The fast urbanization of Tagum from the late '80s to 1990 which was attributed to the mushrooming of business establishments and other commercial activities, increasing population and services and other factors, has caused various problems and needs, like roads, drainage, the increasing numbers of squatters, upscaling trend of traffic congestion in major streets, garbage and sanitation, land use and others..
    - Evidence 2: Wirth was concerned with the effects of the city upon family unity, and he believed urbanization leads to a low and declining urban reproduction rates .. families are smaller and more frequently without children than in the country..
    - Evidence 3: A recent study of 4.4 million men and women in Sweden found a 68%-77% increased risk of diagnosed psychosis for people living in the most urbanized environments, a significant proportion of which is likely to be described as schizophrenia..
    - Evidence 4: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 5: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..
","Supporters of the motion argue that urbanization brings with it a host of challenges that justify resistance. Their first claim is that imposing restrictions on migration would be beneficial for the people in rural areas. Economic decline coupled with increased population and urbanization has led to the decline of agrarian production . Venezuela's urbanization example shows that neglect of rural areas can lead to substantial economic disinvestment, depopulation, and abandonment. Secondly, they argue that urbanization leads to an increase in crime. This is evident in New Zealand's Māori population's struggle with issues like a rise in urban crime, poverty, and health problems following increased urban migration . Rapid urbanization and growing populations in places like Bopal & Ghuma have similarly seen an increase in criminal activities. Thirdly, supporters state that urbanization is harmful to the environment. As urban populations increase, rural populations decrease, leading to rural-urban inequality gap. Rapid economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization increase energy demand and emissions of air pollutants. Additionally, urbanization contributes to sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters, a harmful effect on the environment. Lastly, they claim that urbanization places a strain on cities' resources. Fast urbanization like in the case of Tagum leads to various problems like traffic congestion, sanitation, and land use . Overurbanization leads to detrimental effects like inadequate housing, high mortality, and a lack of educational facilities. In some cases, urbanization can even result in the creation of slums due to local governments' inability to manage it."
We should introduce compulsory voting,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience. A person may also abstain when they do not feel adequately informed about the issue at hand, or have not participated in relevant discussion..
    - Evidence 3: Herbert Spencer noted that whether a person votes for the winning candidate, votes for a losing candidate, or abstains from voting, he will be deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate, if they were to follow the doctrine of Blackstone of which Spencer stated A rather awkward doctrine this..

    - Evidence 1: Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates freedom of speech because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom not to speak..
    - Evidence 2: Minchin was a right faction leader in the Liberal Party, and supported the abolition of Australia's compulsory voting system, on the stated basis that compulsory voting is a fundamental breach of .. civil liberties..
    - Evidence 3: Citizens have the right to choose whether they want to vote. Compulsion is part of a slippery slope to totalitarianism..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed/random manner.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study of the Netherlands found that the abolition of compulsory voting increased the vote share of Dutch social democratic parties while reducing the vote share of minor and extreme parties..
    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 3: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly. The impact of ‘random’ votes ends up being particularly detrimental because it fails to increase civic engagement and may skew election results..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: A recent poll showed most Americans don’t know basic facts about the Constitution. (A third of respondents couldn’t name a single branch of government or a single right protected by the Bill of Rights.) Even worse, people may be voting based on intentional disinformation..

","Those who oppose compulsory voting have significant reasons. Firstly, they assert that abstaining from a vote is also a way to reflect one's preferences. Here, the act of non-participation is seen as a valid expression of one's political views. They support this claim with the philosophical insight from Herbert Spencer that, whether a person votes for the winner, a loser, or abstains, they are implicitly consenting to the rule of the elected candidate. Secondly, opponents believe citizens have an inherent right not to vote. They view compulsory voting as a breach of civil liberties and the freedom of speech, because, as they put it, the right to speak inherently includes the right not to speak. The invocation of totalitarianism as the ultimate endpoint of such compulsion adds weight to their argument. The third criticism is that compulsory voting may lead to uninformed or random voting. They draw on evidence from the Netherlands, where the abolition of compulsory voting led to an increased vote share for mainstream parties and decreased for minor ones. This, they argue, shows that forcing individuals to vote could lead to superficial campaigning techniques, potentially skewing the real intent behind democratic elections. Finally, the opponents of compulsory voting argue that not everyone has the ability to vote, citing a poll that shows most Americans don't know basic facts about their Constitution, suggesting that people might be casting votes based on disinformation."
We should introduce compulsory voting,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should introduce compulsory voting', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Compulsory voting increases representation.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2016 study finds that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement in several ways..
    - Evidence 2: A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda by up to 20 percentage points..
    - Evidence 3: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Since voting at referendums in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory has been allowed in 1977, compulsory voting has also applied there..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
    - Evidence 3: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting increases the political education of the people. They will tend to pay more attention to politics if they know they have to vote..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: People have an obligation to vote.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary..
    - Evidence 2: The European Court of Human Rights, in the 1971 case of X v Austria, ruled that mandatory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, because only attendance at a polling station - and not voting itself - is compulsory, while the voters also have the option of casting a blank or spoiled ballot paper..
    - Evidence 3: A counter argument to opponents of compulsory voting is that in these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot..
    - Evidence 4: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..
    - Evidence 5: Johnson said: Voting is one of our most important rights. African Americans and women fought for years to gain that right in the U.S. And in some countries, people still face barriers, or difficulties, when trying to vote. People who can vote but don’t are taking that right for granted..
","Proponents of compulsory voting believe that it has several significant advantages. They argue that compulsory voting increases representation. They back this claim with a study showing that compulsory voting reduced the gender gap in electoral engagement, and a Swiss study where it was found to boost support for leftist policy positions. They also believe that compulsory voting necessitates politicians to cater to all citizens, not just the well off or well educated. Furthermore, supporters believe that compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics. They point to the case of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory where the introduction of compulsory voting led to improved democratic engagement. This increased interest, they argue, enhances the political education of citizens and lends more legitimacy to elected representatives. Lastly, the supporters believe that citizens have a moral obligation to vote. Drawing on the European Court of Human Rights' 1971 ruling, they argue that compulsory voting doesn't infringe upon fundamental freedoms. They highlight that citizens can still 'spoil' their vote if they wish to abstain, and remind us of the struggles fought to secure this right in many societies, further emphasizing the importance of not taking the right to vote for granted."

Researchers from Boston Medical Center, Boston University, and the University of Victoria in British Columbia found that deadly car crashes involving both cannabis and alcohol consumption have more than doubled in the United States in the past two decades, as have car crash deaths involving just cannabis..
    - Evidence 4: Researchers analyzed 19 years of data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, a national database of fatal crashes on public roads. They found that from 2000 to 2018 the percentage of crash deaths involving cannabis increased from 9 percent to 21.5 percent, and the percentage of deaths involving cannabis and alcohol also more than doubled, from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Their results also show that cannabis-involved car crashes are more likely to involve the deaths of passengers, as well as individuals younger than 35, compared to crash deaths not involving cannabis. Analyses were conducted to account for drug testing rates and alcohol policies, and the results remained consistent..

The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
    - Evidence 2: Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs..
    - Evidence 3: The Department of Justice also considers the fact that people are willing to risk scholastic, career, and legal problems to use cannabis to be evidence of its high potential for abuse..
    - Evidence 4: For instance, NIDA claims the following in its youth publication The Science Behind Drug Abuse: A chemical in marijuana, THC, triggers brain cells to release the chemical dopamine. Dopamine creates good feelings - for a short time. Here's the thing: Once dopamine starts flowing, a user feels the urge to smoke marijuana again, and then again, and then again. Repeated use could lead to addiction, and addiction is a brain disease..

    - Evidence 3: In response to the UK government's official drugs advisory body's opposition to cannabis reclassification (upwards, from a class C to a class B drug) in 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown said: I believe that if we're sending out a signal, particularly to teenagers - and particular those at the most vulnerable age, young teenagers - that in any way we find cannabis acceptable, given all we know about the way that cannabis is being sold in this country, that is not the right thing to do. There is a stronger case now for sending out a signal that cannabis is not only illegal, it is unacceptable..

","On the opposition front, the first argument revolves around the harm cannabis inflicts on the body. Research from the Netherlands shows an increase in THC content, found in cannabis, leads to a rise in impaired psychomotor skills, particularly among inexperienced users. Furthermore, a 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre in Baltimore highlights the impact of heavy, chronic marijuana smoking on proteins associated with heart disease and stroke. Also, the British Lung Foundation found that smoking three cannabis joints inflicts the same damage on the linings of the airways as 20 cigarettes. The second argument addresses the increased lack of judgement or accidents associated with cannabis use. Notably, Anslinger, an infamous anti-drug crusader, proposed that cannabis causes people to commit violent crimes and act irrationally. A 2012 meta-analysis found that acute cannabis use heightened the risk of an automobile crash. Similarly, a recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health revealed a significant increase in deadly car crashes involving cannabis and alcohol consumption in the United States over the past two decades. The third argument is built around the gateway theory, suggesting cannabis paves the way for the abuse of other illicit drugs. A 2006 study by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden demonstrated that adolescent rats given a small dose of THC were more likely to administer larger doses of heroin later on. The fourth argument pertains to the risk of legal cannabis reaching underage individuals. According to federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey, 85% of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain despite the expenditure of billions towards arresting and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses. Lastly, the opposition claims that legal cannabis will boost the black market and criminal activity, citing the numerous illegal cannabis busts in California despite the legalization of medical and recreational use."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: In 2001, the New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group stated that decriminalizing cannabis will result in greater availability of resources to respond to more serious crimes without any increased risks to public safety..
    - Evidence 3: Psychopharmacologist David Nutt argues, though he is against full declassification, that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco, which, if they were invented today would be illegal..
    - Evidence 4: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
    - Evidence 5: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
    - Evidence 3: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 3: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..

    - Evidence 1: British Crime Survey statistics indicated that the proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds using cannabis decreased from 28% a decade ago to 21%, with its declining popularity accelerating after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C was announced in January 2004. The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Proponents of fully decriminalizing cannabis to allow the regulated cultivation and sale of cannabis, including Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, argue that fully decriminalizing cannabis would largely decrease financial gains earned by gangs in black market cannabis sales and trafficking..
    - Evidence 2: Nicholas Green, chairman of the Bar Council, made comments in a report in the profession's magazine, in which he said that drug-related crime costs the UK economy about Â£13bn a year and that there was growing evidence that decriminalisation could free up police resources, reduce crime and recidivism and improve public health..
    - Evidence 3: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
    - Evidence 4: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
    - Evidence 5: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..

  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.

","Proponents of cannabis legalization offer counterarguments. Their first argument is that alcohol and tobacco, which are legal, cause more harm than cannabis. A 2002 DAWN report for the USA documents more than half a million deaths a year from legal substances, while only two possible drug-induced deaths were reported from marijuana. Secondly, they argue that cannabis is financially beneficial. It's suggested that legalizing cannabis could save billions by reducing prohibition enforcement and generate billions in annual tax revenues through proposed taxation and regulation. The third claim is that cannabis can be safe, healthy, and provide pain relief. For example, a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences states that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans due to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart. The fourth argument states that legalizing cannabis would lead to its regulation. British Crime Survey statistics showed a decrease in cannabis usage among 16-24 year-olds after the decision to downgrade the drug to class C in 2004. Their fifth claim is that legalizing cannabis will decrease black-market activity and associated criminal activity, as the drug's financial appeal would be reduced. They cite support from Law Enforcement Against Prohibition and several British officials. Lastly, proponents argue that individuals should have the right to do whatever they want to their bodies, a notion rooted in philosopher John Stuart Mill's harm principle that underlines the sovereignty of the individual over their own body and mind."

- claim_1: Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A survey in completed in Athens in the late 1980s found that 12 of 350 registered prostitutes were HIV positive; in the late 1990s, 44 surveyed foreign prostitutes were HIV positive..
    - Evidence 2: One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana. The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia..
    - Evidence 3: Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes..
    - Evidence 4: Some studies of prostitution in urban settings in developing countries, such as Kenya, have stated that prostitution acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behaviour like pimping/organized crime/trafficking.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Additionally it is argued that the legalisation of prostitution would result in an increase in human trafficking and crime..
    - Evidence 2: Bob Herbert also stated that many brothel prostitutes are controlled by outside pimps: Despite the fiction that they are independent contractors,most so-called legal prostitutes have pimps - the state-sanctioned pimps who run the brothels and, in many cases, a second pimp who controls all other aspects of their lives (and takes the bulk of their legal earnings)..
    - Evidence 3: The United Nations stated in 2009 that sex trafficking is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking and estimates that about 79% of human trafficking reported is for prostitution.
    - Evidence 4: In 2005 Amma Asante and Karina Schaapman, two councilors for the Labour Party (Netherlands), wrote a report, Het onzichtbare zichtbaar gemaakt (Making the Invisible Visible). Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..
    - Evidence 5: Maxwell (2000) and other researcher have found substantial evidence that there is strong co-occurrence between prostitution, drug use, drug selling, and involvement in non-drug crimes, particularly property crime..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The issue of unintended consequences was raised by critics of the proposed legislation in Sweden in 1996 three years before it took place, namely that it would drive women in prostitution underground, increase the risk of violence, harm the most vulnerable, and be almost impossible to enforce, which some claim has happened.
    - Evidence 2: Many feminists are opposed to prostitution, which they see as a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and as a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men..
    - Evidence 3: Columnist Bob Herbert wrote A grotesque exercise in the dehumanization of women is carried out routinely at Sheri's Ranch, a legal brothel about an hour's ride outside of Vegas. There the women have to respond like Pavlov's dog to an electronic bell that might ring at any hour of the day or night. At the sound of the bell, the prostitutes have five minutes to get to an assembly area where they line up, virtually naked, and submit to a humiliating inspection by any prospective customer who has happened to drop by.
    - Evidence 4: The Aboriginal Women's Action Network, an abolitionist organization in Canada, has specifically noted that because the prostitution of Aboriginal women results from and reinforces such extreme hatred of Aboriginal women, no regime of legalisation (which will expand the industry and entrap more women) can be safer for Aboriginal women. Prostitution can only further harm Aboriginal women..
    - Evidence 5: Melissa Farley argues that Nevada's high rape rate is connected to legal prostitution because Nevada is the only US state which allows legal brothels and is ranked 4th out of the 50 U.S. states for sexual assault crimes, saying, Nevada's rape rate is higher than the U.S. average and way higher than the rape rate in California, New York and New Jersey. Why is this? Legal prostitution creates an atmosphere in this state in which women are not humans equal to them, are disrespected by men, and which then sets the stage of increased violence against women..
- claim_4: Selling one's body is immoral.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Such feminists see prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, as the client has sex with a woman who does not enjoy it and who may be making a tremendous psychological effort to mentally dissociate herself from the client. They say that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act as it puts the woman in a subordinate position, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client..

","The topic of 'legalizing prostitution' has been met with stern opposition from some parties, who contend that this would entail a myriad of adverse consequences. First, they argue that such legalization would lead to an escalation in sexually transmitted diseases, a claim substantiated by several pieces of evidence. An Athens-based survey from the late 1980s found that of 350 registered prostitutes, 12 were HIV positive. By the late 1990s, this number had risen significantly among foreign prostitutes. Furthermore, studies in Africa, specifically in Ghana and Kenya, revealed prostitution as a major source of HIV and STD transmission. These studies demonstrate the health risks associated with prostitution, which are unlikely to be ameliorated by registration. Second, opponents highlight the moral complications of such a move, asserting that it would fuel immoral behaviour like pimping, organized crime, and trafficking. This is backed by several pieces of evidence, including a 2009 United Nations report, which stated that 79% of human trafficking is for prostitution. It is also argued that legalization can indirectly facilitate exploitation by pimps and criminal gangs, as evidenced by findings from the Netherlands, where such patterns were found after legalization. Third, critics argue that legalizing sex work will perpetuate violence against women. Citing critics of proposed legislation in Sweden, they note that legalization could increase risks for women in prostitution and further entrench societal patriarchy. Columnist Bob Herbert also highlighted the dehumanization of women in legalized brothels. Furthermore, studies such as Melissa Farley's suggest a correlation between legalized prostitution and high rates of sexual assault. Lastly, opponents argue that selling one's body is fundamentally immoral. This claim, however, lacks any explicit evidence in this material but could be supported by a perspective that views prostitution as a form of male dominance over women."
We should legalize prostitution,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize prostitution', Its positive supporters argue that:

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Because whores are necessary in big cities and especially in cities of commerce such as ours - indeed it is far better to have these women than not to have them - and also because the holy church tolerates whores on good grounds, for these reasons the court and sheriff of Amsterdam shall not entirely forbid the keeping of brothels..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The report also addressed the suggestion of civil remedy, stating that the person exploited in prostitution may normally be considered the injured party, implying a civil right to damages under the law..
    - Evidence 2: Proponents of decriminalization believe that all people, including sex workers, are entitled to the same rights regarding safety, health and human rights, and that outdated criminal laws need to be reformed in order to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers..
    - Evidence 3: Ethnographical research on street prostitution, done by Alexandra Oliveira, of University of Porto has led the researcher to argue that prostitution should be legalized to improve the situation of the women..
    - Evidence 4: The Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour calls for the legalization of sex work, the elimination of state regulations that are more repressive than those imposed on other workers and businesses, the right to recognition and protection under labour and employment laws, the right to form and join professional associations or unions, and the right to legally cross borders to work.
    - Evidence 5: In 2003, the Ministry of Justice considered legalising prostitution as an official occupation with health benefits and taxable income and held a public discussion on the topic..
- claim_3: Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent..
    - Evidence 2: The goal in decriminalizing sex work is that anyone doing any type of sex work would be treated the same way, with the same rights and responsibilities, as any other self-employed person. Whether they support decriminalization or some form of legalization, pro-sex work feminists believe that the current laws that exist surrounding prostitution in many countries need to be changed and are harmful to the people who work in the industry..
    - Evidence 3: In the 1990s, Dutch attitudes supported the legalization of prostitution: in a 1997 survey, 73 percent of Dutch citizens favored legalization of brothels, 74 percent said that prostitution was an acceptable job, and in a 1999 poll 78 percent felt that prostitution is a job like any other job (polls cited in Weitzer 2000, p. 178.
    - Evidence 4: Since 2003, Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman has repeatedly stated that he favors legalization of prostitution in the city, perhaps turning East Fremont Street into a little Amsterdam. Goodman said there are pragmatic reasons to back legalized prostitution. Those include the acknowledgement that illegal prostitution is occurring and that brothels could provide safer, regulated and revenue-generating sex, he said..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Women in indoor and outdoor prostitution both report high levels of violence and constant need for vigilance and fear..
    - Evidence 2: The police only interfered when public order was at stake or in cases of human trafficking. The reasoning behind this gedoogbeleid (policy of tolerance) was harm reduction, and the belief that the enforcement of the anti-prostitution laws would be counterproductive, and that the best way to protect the women was to tolerate prostitution. This genuine Dutch policy of tolerating formally illegal activities for harm reduction purposes has been and still is also applied towards illegal drugs in the Netherlands..
    - Evidence 3: In 1996-97, following the success of prevention interventions in neighboring Thailand, the Chinese CDC launched the first intervention projects to promote safer sex behaviors to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers working at entertainment establishments in Yunnan..
    - Evidence 4: Whilst such campaigns may have failed to eradicate prostitution in toto, there is some evidence that regulation of China's recreational venues has helped to create a legitimate female service worker with the right to refuse to engage in practices repugnant to the valid labour contract, as well as the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace..
    - Evidence 5: The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers' fight for decriminalisation.It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes' safety and health..
- claim_5: Sex work is a valid choice over your body.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Many people who support legal prostitution argue that prostitution is a consensual sex act between adults and a victimless crime, thus the government should not prohibit this practice..
    - Evidence 2: The potential benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include greater disposable income, access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options..
    - Evidence 3: For the purposes of decriminalization, Feminists for Free Expression defines the word prostitution to mean any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved; nonconsensual sex acts or sex acts perpetrated against minors are not prostitution, in their view. Instead they prefer the term criminal sexual acts..
    - Evidence 4: A 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that among the sex workers surveyed, sex work had become normalized..
    - Evidence 5: Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the Prostitution Information Center, from Amsterdam, holds that: In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this .. Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will..
","Proponents of 'legalizing prostitution' assert that the move would have several benefits, both for the individuals involved and society at large. First, they contend that the legalization of sex work could provide an economic boost. Historical precedents like the city of Amsterdam and one of Seattle's founders, David Swinson 'Doc' Maynard, support this claim by illustrating how well-regulated prostitution can contribute to the economy. Second, supporters argue that legalizing sex work would enhance sex workers' benefits, including healthcare, safe sex practices, and unionization rights. A wide range of evidence supports this claim, from a report that acknowledges the right of those exploited in prostitution to damages, to the Canadian Guild for Erotic Labour's call for the legalization and regulation of sex work to provide better working conditions and rights for sex workers. Third, proponents assert that legalization would enable better regulation of the profession. A 1995 study noted that consistent condom use in brothels led to the absence of STDs, showing how regulation could improve health outcomes. Similarly, attitudes in the Netherlands and Las Vegas support the notion that regulated, legal prostitution can be a valid occupation. Fourth, they claim that legalization will increase safety for sex workers. This is substantiated by evidence from the Netherlands, China, and New Zealand, demonstrating how regulation and decriminalization can mitigate violence and improve health and safety conditions for sex workers. Lastly, supporters argue that sex work should be recognized as a valid choice over one's body. They posit that as long as it is consensual, it should not be prohibited by the government. Additionally, it is suggested that prostitution can provide financial and social mobility benefits, and some studies have noted that sex work has become normalized among sex workers, reinforcing the argument for its acceptance as a profession."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Instead of policy expanding women's opportunities for gainful employment policy, from 1979 onward the one-child policy has added upon the son preference causing the largest number of missing women in any country..
    - Evidence 2: Some bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society . Charles Lockwood of Yale says, a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars..
    - Evidence 3: When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences..
    - Evidence 4: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
    - Evidence 5: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: With socioeconomic improvements, modernization and the rise in women's status, son preference has declined in many urban areas in China but has persisted in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, reasserting itself under the one-child policy..
    - Evidence 2: Gender-biased sex selection (GBSS) is a result and an expression of cultural preference for sons..
    - Evidence 3: Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son, while a deeply rooted son preference makes many families want a son..
    - Evidence 4: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
    - Evidence 5: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 3: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
    - Evidence 4: Under the tradition of son preference and the one-child policy, missing females in China are formed through sex-selective abortion, discrimination in care for females, and non-registration of girls at birth..
    - Evidence 5: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
","The opponents present three main arguments against it: gender imbalance, gender stereotypes, and the potential for increased abortions or infanticide. They argue that sex selection could exacerbate gender imbalances, citing China's one-child policy that bolstered son preference and resulted in the largest number of missing women globally. Some bioethicists, including Charles Lockwood of Yale, warn of the potential for social unrest and even wars from significant gender imbalances. The evidence further points to the declining ratio of girls to boys in India and China due to the preference for boys. Opponents also argue that sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes and biases. They note that even with socioeconomic improvements and modernization, son preference still persists in some strictly traditional families and rural areas, especially in China. They argue that gender-biased sex selection is a manifestation of cultural preference for sons, leading to the discrimination of girls who are seen as depriving parents of the chance to have a son. Lastly, opponents of sex selection argue that it could potentially lead to increased rates of abortion and infanticide. They present evidence of how son-preference and the one-child policy in China have resulted in sex-selective abortions and the neglect, or even killing, of girls. In Britain, there was a case where two doctors accepted a request to perform an abortion based on sex selection, which is illegal, highlighting potential abuses of the practice."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Most families opt for unisex stuffs for babies before they are born. From clothes to toys, the color of the crib to the various necessities and accessories, everything is gender neutral in most cases. With gender selection or knowing baby’s gender can help every family to buy gender specific items. This not only does away with the ambiguity but actually helps the baby to get the best stuff as well. There is also a financial aspect as after the birthing of a baby, the parents always spend money on items that are for a boy or girl respectively. Knowing the gender or choosing gender allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The economic advantage is not oft talked about but it is significant..
    - Evidence 3: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
    - Evidence 4: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 4: There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire..
    - Evidence 5: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 3: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..

","The proponents of the debate topic, 'We should legalize sex selection,' base their arguments on parental freedoms, family planning, family happiness, disease prevention, and reducing abortions or infanticide. Advocates argue that it is within the parents' freedoms to select the gender of their child. They believe that fulfilling the desire for a specific gender could instill some gender balance in the family. Moreover, it allows parents to plan for the family financially and to prevent gender-specific diseases. Proponents also argue that sex selection allows for better family planning. It provides control over the number of children they have, facilitating better care and educational opportunities. It is particularly beneficial in countries with population control measures, allowing parents to choose the gender of their single permitted child. They also claim that sex selection contributes to family happiness and completeness. It is argued that parents being able to choose their child's gender would result in more love towards the child. For parents who have lost a child, the ability to choose the gender of the next child can offer comfort. Proponents of sex selection argue it can be used to prevent diseases in the child. Technologies like Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) can prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases and other disorders. Lastly, supporters argue that sex selection could help prevent abortions and infanticide, especially where there is a cultural preference for a specific gender. If parents can choose the gender before birth, it could reduce the occurrence of gender-specific infanticide."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In common usage, the phrase 'flag burning' refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest..
    - Evidence 2: In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7-2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:  In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth..
    - Evidence 3: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 5: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Judge White did not go so far as to say that flag-burning is not constitutionally protected; rather, he wrote that without the benefit of the majority's thinking if it were to find flag burning protected by the First Amendment, I would sustain such a conviction..
    - Evidence 2: In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 3: the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
    - Evidence 4: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
","The opposition stands firmly against the prohibition of flag burning, contending that it serves as an effective tool of expression, protest, and critique. We argue that flag burning is an important form of symbolic speech, as recognized by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The term 'flag burning' in common parlance refers specifically to an act of protest, rather than a senseless act of vandalism. This is exemplified in cases such as that of John Tinker and his sister, Mary Beth Tinker, whose quiet and passive protest of wearing black armbands was recognized as a form of protected symbolic speech by the court. Similarly, the case of Gregory Lee Johnson in 1984 provides another vivid example of flag burning as a form of expression. Mr. Johnson burned an American flag in protest of the policies of the Reagan administration, an act that was eventually ruled by the court as being sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment. Furthermore, we argue that flag burning is justified under the banner of freedom of expression. Judge White noted that if flag burning were found to be protected by the First Amendment, he would sustain such a conviction. Even the Supreme Court found in 1989 that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment. As Justice Brennan wrote, the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable."
We should prohibit flag burning,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Warren was of the opinion that laws against flag-burning are constitutional.
    - Evidence 2: Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country's own national flag and flags of other countries..
    - Evidence 3: By 1932, all of the States had adopted flag desecration laws. In general, these State laws outlawed: (i) placing any kind of marking on the flag, whether for commercial, political, or other purposes; (ii) using the flag in any form of advertising; and (iii) publicly mutilating, trampling, defacing, defiling, defying or casting contempt, either by words or by act, upon the flag..
    - Evidence 4: For example, Hugo Black did not believe that flag burning was speech; in Street v. New York (1969), he wrote: It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
- claim_2: flag burning is an inflammatory act.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Rehnquist argued that flag burning is no essential part of any exposition of ideas but rather the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others.
    - Evidence 2: In 2003,  Khalid led a protest march of several hundred people through Ras-Al Khaimah that culminated with Khalid himself burning the American flag and allowed the local radio station to broadcast a consistently anti-US line..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that deserves to be outlawed..
    - Evidence 4: According to the ordinance in Hong Kong, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling the flag is considered flag desecration..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","We, the proponents of this motion, argue that we should prohibit flag burning due to the inherent respect and symbolism flags carry, and to deter the inflammatory act of flag desecration. We affirm the notion expressed by Warren that laws against flag-burning are constitutional and therefore enforceable. The majority of countries across the globe recognize the importance of their national symbols and have laws forbidding the desecration of their flags, including burning them in public or using them for commercial purposes. For instance, by 1932, all American states had adopted flag desecration laws which prohibited the marking of the flag for any purposes and its use in any form of advertising. Even Hugo Black, a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, did not consider flag burning as a form of speech, implying a high level of reverence for the flag. We also argue that flag burning is an inherently inflammatory act. Justice Rehnquist has described flag burning as an 'inarticulate grunt or roar', most likely indulged not to express any idea but to antagonize others. Recent history records events such as the protest led by Khalid in 2003 where the act of burning the American flag led to antagonism. It's our belief that such offensive gestures should be regulated by law to ensure respect for our national symbol is maintained. In conclusion, due to the symbolic importance of the flag and the inflammatory nature of desecration, we maintain that the prohibition of flag burning is a necessary step in preserving national respect and order."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls and makes our communities safer and healthier. It is a human right and it is good for the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations. Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy. In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy..
    - Evidence 3: The principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work has been enshrined in the European Treaties since 1957 (today: Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). Article 153 TFEU allows the EU to act in the wider area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in employment matters and within this framework Article 157 TFEU authorises positive action to empower women. In addition, Article 19 TFEU provides for the adoption of legislation to combat all forms of discrimination, including on the basis of sex. Legislation against trafficking in human beings, in particular women and children, has been adopted on the basis of Articles 79 and 83 TFEU. The Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme finances, among others, measures contributing to the eradication of violence against women, based on Article 168 TFEU..
    - Evidence 4: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
    - Evidence 5: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: As a health professional and a researcher, Mar Nagel found that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions. They have better social and communication skills than men, possess strong memory, are sophisticated and show precision and fast reaction and response time..
    - Evidence 3: Equal or Better Performance at Military Service Academies: Women have been admitted to the Army, Navy and Air Force Academies since 1978. In this year’s first graduating classes with women, the women’s performance has equaled and often surpassed that of their male counterparts..
    - Evidence 4: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
    - Evidence 5: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address..
    - Evidence 2: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 4: The more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed..
    - Evidence 5: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Nindl, et al. (p. 51, 2016), training programs increased the number of pull-ups that women were capable of, demonstrating that they could overcome their naturally smaller muscle mass. Additionally, their research found that women performed better than men in ultra-endurance, or the ability to physical endure for a given extended period of time. These studies suggest that women excel in some abilities, and that while men are indeed stronger as a physical typicality, there are exceptions and other ways that women can compete..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
    - Evidence 3: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 4: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
    - Evidence 2: In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty..
    - Evidence 3: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 4: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
    - Evidence 5: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has. Having a wider personnel base allows militaries to have the best and most diplomatic soldiers working to end conflict quickly..
- claim_6: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: As long as they qualify and meet the standards, women will now be able to contribute to our mission in ways they could not before. They'll be able to drive tanks, give orders, lead infantry soldiers into combat, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said at a news conference Thursday (Dec. 3)..
    - Evidence 2: Joni Ernst, Republican senator from Iowa and an Army veteran, also backs the measure. Ernst said a draft is very unlikely, and the all-volunteer force is preferable, but women would be essential in any future conflict. Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
    - Evidence 3: Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women. Even if there is some evidence to these claims, which are often exaggerated, women have rights, one of which is to be assessed as individuals. Even if 99 percent of women do not meet military fitness standards, the 1percent who do should be allowed to use their abilities to serve their country..
    - Evidence 4: The Army has recently introduced a new Physical Employment Standards (PES) for all ground close combat roles which will come into effect from 2019. It includes new physical fitness standards that are objective, measurable, role-related and gender-free, to ensure Army personnel have the physical capability to meet the necessary force preparation and operational requirements. PES will be incorporated into a new structured suite of Army Role Fitness Tests – a series of tests designed to assess whether personnel are fit for a specific role. Tests include casualty extraction from a vehicle, repeated lift and carry, plus fire and manoeuvre drills. The standards are based on analysis of each role’s requirements, leveraging scientific research conducted by the University of Chichester. Female soldiers who fail the new fitness tests will not be allowed to serve in combat roles. Period..
    - Evidence 5: Just like men, women should be allowed to choose how they fight for their country based on their strengths. Joining a combat unit requires meeting high demands regardless of gender; if there are women who are able to meet the same training standards as men, they can only be an asset to their team. If the military is looking for the creme de la creme to serve in their units, then why give up on 51% of the candidates upfront?.
","The opponents of the stance 'We should prohibit women in combat' construct a multifaceted argument, leveraging historical, social, and practical evidence to support their position. Firstly, they argue on the grounds of gender equality, pointing out that equality is not just a human right but also an economic boon. Citing the European Union's legislation, they highlight the long-standing principle that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work. Further, they suggest that improving gender equality could lead to substantial GDP increases, as exemplified by the case of OECD countries where increasing female employment rates to match Sweden's could potentially result in a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. The second claim advocates that women are not only capable of combat but are actually a valuable asset. Historical evidence such as women serving alongside men since the Revolutionary War is presented. Furthermore, the superior cognitive, strategic decision-making, and social communication skills that women can possess, as observed by health professional Mar Nagel, are also highlighted. The argument is then extended to assert that women bring unique skills and strategies to combat scenarios. From their ability to address security risks uniquely, such as the example of Afghan women being more comfortable interacting with female service members, to their different perspectives and problem-solving approaches, women have a distinct and beneficial impact on the effectiveness of military units. The fourth claim posits that women can overcome physical differences and prove equally competent in combat. Evidence is presented to show women's superior ultra-endurance and the historical instances where women have led and excelled in combat roles, such as the Russian Women’s Battalion of Death in World War I and various roles in the U.S. military from the Revolutionary War to the present day. Additionally, the proponents contend that women should have the choice to serve in combat roles if they wish to. The sexism inherent in arguments against women in combat is called out and evidence like a 2010 British Ministry of Defense study, which concluded women performed the same as men, is introduced. Lastly, it is suggested that as long as women pass the required tests, they should be accepted for combat roles. This idea is supported by the fact that physical employment standards are objective, measurable, role-related, and gender-free, assessing individuals based on capability rather than gender. In essence, the argument is that the abilities of women who meet the standards should be acknowledged and utilized in service of their country."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
    - Evidence 3: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
    - Evidence 4: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The physical differences between men and women are obvious, as few women have the strength, speed, or aerobic capacity of even the average man. The British military determined that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units..
    - Evidence 2: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
    - Evidence 3: While the majority of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves.  In addition, combat units engage in activities designed to suit men’s capabilities. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this..
    - Evidence 4: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
    - Evidence 5: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Having women serving in direct combat will hamper mission effectiveness by hurting unit morale and cohesion..
    - Evidence 2: Presidential candidate Rick Santorum voiced their concerns last week when he said that women serving on the front line could prove a distraction to men. Men have emotions when [they] see a woman in harm’s way, he said. It’s natural. It’s very much in our culture to be protective..
    - Evidence 3: Inconvenient truth is that men and women have been each other’s most consistent distraction since the beginning of time. To pretend that we don’t know what will happen when men and women are thrown together for prolonged periods in emotionally intense situations defies common sense. Being overly academic and insufficiently adult about adult behavior isn’t just irresponsible but imperiling, and belies the deadly seriousness with which we should want combat units to perform..
    - Evidence 4: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
    - Evidence 5: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected..
    - Evidence 3: 1988 – The DoD convenes its Task Force on Women in the Military and adopts the “risk rule,” which excludes women from combat units or missions which risk exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture..
    - Evidence 4: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
    - Evidence 5: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
    - Evidence 2: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..

","Supporters of the topic put forth the following arguments: Men are better suited to combat roles than women. This is supported by the biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density which affect their ability to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness (Veteran quote, Journal of Sports Science & Medicine, Marine Corps study). Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers. Evidenced by the British military's determination that only 1 in 100 trained female soldiers had the physical capacity to function in infantry and armor units. Further, the US Army has found that nearly half of female soldiers fail the Army Combat Fitness Test, raising concerns about whether increased fitness demands create barriers to success for women (Military.com). Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. Presidential candidate Rick Santorum argues that men's protective emotions toward women could become a distraction in combat. Furthermore, instances of fraternization may degrade unit cohesion and impact morale, potentially reducing operational effectiveness (Ministry of Defence). Women should serve in safer roles. During the Second World War, many women served successfully in non-combat roles including mechanics, pilots, and nurses. The 'warrior cultur' often prevalent in armed forces equates women with weakness and the need to be protected, suggesting their suitability for non-combat roles (Canadian Armed Forces study, DoD Task Force). The capture of women soldiers is a major concern. This is based on historical evidence of female soldiers being raped when captured in wars with Iraq. The argument suggests that women are less able to resist cold, interrogation, and stress due to their physiological and psychological makeup (ex-soldier quote). These arguments collectively assert that women should be prohibited from combat roles based on their physical and emotional characteristics, potential to distract or harm military function, suitability for safer roles, and the perceived risks associated with their capture."

","Our stance today is that journalism should not be subsidized. We firmly believe that government intervention risks inserting bias and harming objectivity. Looking at the history, we have examples like the alleged bias by Time Warner towards the Church of Scientology and the accusations of anti-India bias in the BBC's reportage. Government funding could potentially lead to favoritism in reporting, creating a perceived conflict of interest and damaging the fundamental principle of journalistic objectivity.  Furthering our point, we argue that the funds used for subsidizing journalism could be better spent elsewhere. Drawing from the past, when the only medium of communication was newspapers, postal subsidies were justifiable. However, in today's diverse media landscape, federal subsidies would likely protect inefficient companies, stifle competition, and discourage entrepreneurial initiatives. This is not the kind of environment we want to foster. Lastly, we stand on the belief that journalism, like any other business, should be self-sustainable. If it cannot survive on its own, it should be allowed to fail. In the wake of the federal government's bailout of banks and automobile manufacturers, it's clear that taxpayers can't afford to support failing media companies, nor should journalism be dependent on a government that is already burdened with debt."

United Kingdom that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom .. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest..
    - Evidence 2: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..

","Those in favor of subsidizing journalism present several well-supported claims. Claim 1: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable. The viability of journalism, according to supporters, is essential for press freedom, as highlighted by the European Court of Human Rights in the Goodwin v. United Kingdom case in 1996. Additionally, with the proliferation of information online, including blogs and comments on news websites, the task of sifting through information has become complex, thus the need for a strong journalistic infrastructure. The 70% of Americans who believe that journalism is crucial to maintaining community quality of life and those concerned about the decline of investigative journalism funding underscore this point. In light of the substantial revenue losses experienced by news media during the pandemic, state subsidies have become a significant factor in ensuring the financial viability of media markets. Claim 2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability. The ongoing technological development in the digital age has led to an increased reliance on non-institutionalized and transnational information sources. Supporters of solutions journalism also see it as a valuable feedback system, providing credible responses to emerging societal challenges. The Associated Press has become an efficient source of accurate reporting, serving the growing demand for news. A study by the Trilateral Commission also suggested that the development of television journalism had a significant influence on the national power dynamics and undermined governmental authority. Claim 3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism. Advocates argue that subsidies can improve journalistic standards, as evidenced by the International Federation of Journalists' Ethical Journalism Initiative. Subsidies can also enhance journalists' economic literacy, as suggested by the IPD journalism program, and foster a media-plural Europe that encourages democratic decision-making and counters the prevalence of fake news. Claim 4: Subsidy increases objectivity in reporting. The last claim posits that subsidies can promote peace journalism, which presents local perspectives that oppose violence-exacerbating war journalism and expose violent groups' attempts to manipulate and exploit meaning. In conclusion, supporters of subsidies for journalism argue that such support is necessary for the viability, accountability, quality, and objectivity of journalism in our increasingly complex information environment."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,gpt4,all_golden,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
    - Evidence 2: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 3: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
    - Evidence 4: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
    - Evidence 2: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 3: Rockets and spaceflight instruments do not assemble themselves. They are designed and built by people, who get paid. They are fabricated from components which have to be manufactured and then purchased. The community engaged in the space industry includes specialist scientists and engineers, designers, graphic artists and IT professionals, as well as a vast support system: HR, catering, cleaning, etc..
    - Evidence 4: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
    - Evidence 5: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
    - Evidence 2: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 3: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
    - Evidence 4: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.

    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
    - Evidence 3: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
    - Evidence 4: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..

","The opponents of the topic 'We should subsidize space exploration' have presented their arguments under four key claims. Claim 1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector. The opponents cite the significant achievements of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic as evidence for the potential of the private sector in space exploration. They point to SpaceX's successful delivery of cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) and their $3 billion contract for developing lunar lander spacecraft. They also reference NASA's agreement with Axiom Space to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed and the contracts awarded to Blue Origin, Nanoracks, and Northrop Grumman to develop commercial space stations. Claim 2: Space exploration is expensive. The opposing party argues that the financial implications of space exploration are substantial. They present evidence such as the cost of launching payloads into orbit, the ongoing costs of research and development, the cost of the personnel involved in the space industry, and the total annual budget of space agencies, which stands at $41.8 billion. Claim 3: Space exploration is ineffective Critics of space exploration funding argue that many endeavors in this area are scientifically useless. They highlight that satellite technology, while beneficial, does not contribute to life on Earth beyond providing commercial profits. Moreover, they argue that space travel is a significant source of pollution, with single launches producing hundreds of tons of carbon dioxide. Claim 4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration. Finally, the opposition asserts that there are more pressing and immediate issues that should receive funding, such as poverty, healthcare, and education. They argue that spending large sums of money on reaching other planets is questionable when those resources could be used to solve more immediate problems like global warming, crime, and diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. They offer a perspective on potential alternative uses for a $19.3 billion budget like funding university education for millions of young adults, providing healthcare for a similar number, or using that money to fund NASA for a year."

    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe..
    - Evidence 3: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
    - Evidence 4: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
    - Evidence 5: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars..
    - Evidence 2: Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence..
    - Evidence 3: An artist’s concept of New Horizons during the spacecraft’s planned encounter with Pluto and its moon Charon. The craft’s miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and space plasma experiments would characterize the global geology and geomorphology of Pluto and Charon, map their surface compositions and temperatures, and examine Pluto’s atmosphere in detail..
    - Evidence 4: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
    - Evidence 5: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..

    - Evidence 1: Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more. We're constantly evolving and finding new ways to add value..
    - Evidence 2: Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA’s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations..
    - Evidence 3: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 4: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..

    - Evidence 5: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..

Moreover, the expansion of our ecological niche into the solar system will open up possibilities for immense growth and survival. Walter Cugno of Thales Alenia Space underscores this view, arguing that space exploration offers opportunities to better understand ourselves, our planet, and improve life on Earth. Claim 2: Space exploration leads to advancements in science and technology. Evidence: Space exploration acts as a catalyst for technological innovation and scientific research. These advancements have provided us with tools and motivation to address significant challenges on Earth. For instance, satellite imagery and climate data support sectors like agriculture, helping to increase food production and identify new economic growth opportunities. Claim 3: Space exploration is financially beneficial. Evidence: Investment in space exploration not only creates jobs but also stimulates economic growth. For instance, Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate more than $1 trillion in revenue by 2040, primarily driven by satellite broadband Internet access.

","In the debate on whether 'We should subsidize vocational education', the opponents propose the following arguments: Firstly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education diverts money from more worthy causes. To support this claim, they point to a 2018 study by the Urban Institute, which suggests vocational subsidies may not yield a good return on investment due to the limited career success or high-paying jobs produced by these programs. Furthermore, a 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research claims that such subsidies can detract funds from vital initiatives like early childhood education, K-12 education, and higher education. Secondly, opponents claim that subsidizing vocational education is expensive. To back up this claim, they reference a report by the Center for American Progress (2018) and a study by the National Conference of State Legislatures (2021) that assert vocational education programs often require significant resources, which can compete with other educational priorities for funding. Thirdly, they argue that subsidizing vocational education leads to an influx in those professions. This claim is supported by evidence from studies analyzing the effects of subsidy programs in Germany and Switzerland. These studies found that subsidies significantly increased enrollment in vocational programs, potentially causing an imbalance by concentrating too many students in vocational fields. Lastly, opponents believe vocational education is not a good career choice. The National Skills Coalition's study (2018) supports this by stating that many vocational programs prepare students for low-wage jobs with limited benefits. Additionally, a report by the National Center for Education and the Economy (2014) found limited transferability of skills from vocational programs, impeding workers' ability to switch careers or industries."

","Claim: Subsidizing vocational education promotes those with fewer resources. Argument: Subsidies for vocational education increases its accessibility, particularly for low-income students and those who face barriers to traditional postsecondary education. This is based on the National Skills Coalition's 2020 report that showed such subsidies can increase job opportunities and economic mobility for these individuals (Evidence 1 and Evidence 5). Moreover, a report by the Center for American Progress in 2018 found that subsidies could better align vocational education with local labor market needs, thus improving workforce development. Claim: Vocational education better fits many students. Argument: Vocational education provides a more practical, hands-on learning experience that suits many students better than traditional classroom-based education. This assertion is backed by a 2020 report from the National Skills Coalition and a 2019 study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium, which found vocational education to meet current workforce needs, cater to students' career goals, and lead to lower dropout rates (Evidence 1 and Evidence 2). Claim: Vocational education is a good career choice. Argument: Vocational education prepares individuals for high-demand fields such as healthcare, technology, and advanced manufacturing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2022 highlighted the high demand for skilled workers in these sectors (Evidence 1). A study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in 2020 further indicated that those with vocational education have higher earning potential and shorter time to employment compared to those with traditional degrees (Evidence 2 and Evidence 3). Claim: Vocational education is beneficial for the entire market/society. Argument: Subsidizing vocational education can boost economic growth, increase workforce productivity, and enhance social mobility. The National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium's 2019 study demonstrated that vocational education could address workforce shortages in specific fields (Evidence 1). Meanwhile, a 2020 study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that investing in vocational education could increase workforce productivity and contribute to overall economic development (Evidence 3). Finally, the National Skills Coalition in 2020 found that investing in vocational education could enhance social mobility, making it beneficial for the entire market and society (Evidence 4)."
Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence,-1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person that wants to commit it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Dignity in Dying also outline how they go about their campaign: They encourage their supporters to campaign for a change to the current laws so that a terminally ill, mentally competent adult who feels their suffering has become unbearable can opt for an assisted death, subject to strict rules and safeguards.  They will lobby politicians and other decision makers, and look to educate legal and healthcare professionals and the public in general to support this drive towards obtaining a comprehensive national end-of-life strategy and working procedures..
    - Evidence 2: Dignity in Dying supporters argue that the recent trends towards the use of the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland and press stories regarding botched suicides and do-it-yourself advice would be stopped because individuals would know that when and if they wished to finally request an assisted death in the UK, it would be available as arranged..
    - Evidence 3: A qualitative study using narrative interviews was conducted throughout the UK. Results shows that UK law should be changed to allow assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia was felt strongly by most people. Those who had seen others die were particularly convinced that this should be a right. Some had multiple reasons, including pain and anticipated pain, fear of indignity, loss of control and cognitive impairment. Those who did not want to be a burden also had other reasons for wanting euthanasia. Suicide was contemplated by a few, who would have preferred a change in the law to allow them to end their lives with medical help and in the company of family or friends..
    - Evidence 4: Writing in 2005 about another bill on the topic introduced by Lord Joffe, the House of Lords Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill Committee summarised the debate in this way: The [Joffe] bill is founded on the principle of personal autonomy. Its supporters believe that terminally ill people should have the right, subject to prescribed safeguards, to have medical assistance to die in the same way that patients, whether or not terminally ill, already have the right to refuse life-prolonging treatment..
    - Evidence 5: The campaign group Dignity in Dying, of which Baroness Meacher is chair, has argued that current law contains no safeguards to protect dying people who want to control their death. It states that around 350 Britons have now travelled to Switzerland to end their life, at a cost of around £10,000 each. Dignity in Dying argues that many of these people travel before they are ready to die, because they are afraid of becoming too weak to make the journey. In theory, those that accompany them could face up to 14 years imprisonment..
- claim_2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In early 2014, a New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e. making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient..
    - Evidence 2: It states that euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending physician acts in accordance with criteria of due care. These criteria concern the patient's request, the patient's suffering (unbearable and hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life..
    - Evidence 3: Indeed, studies from parts of the world that have legalised assisted suicide report that many plans put in place for an early death are not taken up as people end up dying naturally, with the peace of mind brought about by knowing that an assisted death was available if pain and suffering had got too much..

    - Evidence 4: Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned..
    - Evidence 5: In response, autonomy and quality-of-life-base arguments are made in support of euthanasia, underscored by claims that when the only way to relieve a dying patient's pain or suffering is terminal sedation with loss of consciousness, death is a preferable alternative - an argument also made in support of physician-assisted suicide..
","Summary of Debate Material: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'

Opponents' Stance and Arguments:

Opponents of criminalizing assisted suicide assert that it should be viewed as a human right for terminally ill, mentally competent adults. They believe it grants dignity to those who wish to end their lives, reduces suffering, respects personal autonomy, and benefits those with terminal illnesses.

Argument 1: Assisted suicide gives dignity to the person who chooses it. They present evidence from Dignity in Dying, a campaign group, which argues that people should be able to opt for an assisted death under strict regulations. They emphasize the urgent need for a comprehensive end-of-life strategy in the UK and mention that the British public generally supports changes to the current law, as shown by a qualitative study.

Argument 2: Assisted suicide reduces suffering. Evidence includes a ruling from New Mexico which allowed terminally ill patients the right to aid in dying. Another argument suggests that knowing assisted suicide is an option can provide peace of mind, even if the option is not ultimately utilized.

Argument 3: People should have the right to end their life. They provide evidence from a court case, Washington v. Glucksberg, where Washington residents asserted that a ban on assisted suicide was unconstitutional. Dignity in Dying also argues for the importance of individual choice in this matter.

Argument 4: The terminally ill would benefit from assisted suicide. They argue this from the perspective of quality-of-life-base arguments that suggest death as a preferable alternative to loss of consciousness or terminal sedation."

","Summary of Debate Material: 'Assisted suicide should be a criminal offence'

Supporters' Stance and Arguments:

Supporters of criminalizing assisted suicide argue that it can lead to the exploitation of vulnerable individuals, can potentially be misused in cases where recovery is possible, contradicts the role of physicians as healers, infringes on legal perspectives around self-harm and harm to others, and often involves individuals who may not be in a state to make clear judgements.

Argument 1: Assisted suicide could be misused for personal benefits. They present evidence that the practice should only be allowed for permanent residents with a long-term history with the doctor.

Argument 2: Many times people can still get better. They argue that depression or fear of being a burden should not lead to assisted suicide, suggesting not every effort for healing has been exhausted.

Argument 3: Assisted suicide violates the doctor's role. They cite Dr. Lynda Young, MD, who stated that physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as a healer.

Argument 4: People do not have the right to self-harm/harm others. Evidence from legal cases and legislations in different countries like New Zealand and the U.S. were cited, asserting that there is no constitutional right to assisted suicide and it's illegal to assist in suicide.

Argument 5: People who are ill may not have clear judgement and are in need of help. They argue that legalizing euthanasia could potentially lead to non-voluntary euthanasia of vulnerable groups, citing the controversial 'slippery slope' argument."

    - Evidence 4: Nelson said: One key benefit is the fact that, if you homeschool, you can personalise the education that your child receives according to their interests, needs, ability, and learning style. This might include spending more time outside doing physical exercise, letting them learn more about a subject that’s piqued their interest, or giving them the day off if they’re ill. When education is personalised, children are more engaged. It also allows them to discover their aptitudes and develop as people.
    - Evidence 5: The efficiency of homeschooling – and the fact that you don’t have to follow the national curriculum or the typical timings of a school day – leaves you with time to spend broadening your child’s learning. You can make time for play, projects, real experiments, and the arts.

","Summary of Debate Material:

Opponents of the proposition ""Homeschooling should be banned"" have the following key arguments:

Homeschooling is beneficial for students with exceptional needs, religious requirements, illness, or disabilities. The provided evidence shows that homeschooling provides specialized education services to students who might not thrive in a traditional school environment. Homeschooling is also a viable option for families living in isolated rural locations, families living temporarily abroad, and families who travel frequently.

Homeschooling can be personalized to meet the child's pace and needs. Evidence suggests that homeschooling allows for differentiation and customization based on the child's interests, abilities, and learning style, fostering a more engaged learning environment.

Homeschooling offers a safe environment, free from violence and bullying that can occur in mainstream schools.

Parents should be allowed to decide on the kind of education their children receive. This argument supports the autonomy of parents in deciding the best education platform for their children, highlighting homeschooling as a valuable choice.

The home can be a conducive learning environment. This viewpoint posits that a home environment provides a broader socialization and a more active learning environment, which may prove beneficial for certain students."

    - Evidence 2: Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home. Garrison, who started the No Longer Quivering blog, says her near-constant pregnancies - which tended to result either in miscarriages or life-threatening deliveries - took a toll on her body and depleted her energy. She wasn't able to devote enough time and energy to homeschooling to ensure a quality education for each child. And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years..
    - Evidence 3: I'm fine with homeschooling, if parents can do it. But that's a big 'if', and there has got to be regulation to ensure that children aren't being abused. Public school is a lot more than just an educational opportunity; it's the single most important social safety net we have in America, because it exists for the most vulnerable section of our population: children. A lot of child abuse cases are detected because teachers noticed suspicious marks on a child. Far more children than any of us would like to believe only get adequate nutrition because of free or reduced price breakfast and lunch at school. School is also the number one reason why parents get their kids vaccinated, because it's usually required for entry; if nothing requires it, it's too easy to just put it off..
    - Evidence 4: Yes, as Calli Arcale and I both have said, homeschooling can be done effectively. However, without oversight, without someone looking in on these kids a few times for the 18 years they're under their parents thumb, the potential for abuse is there. And look, sure enough, abuse. What percentage of kids are abused this way? Who knows? What level would be acceptable? I would suggest zero-tolerance. If even 1% of households are homeschooling with the goal of restricting their children's options, and leaving them functionally illiterate so they're easier to be controlled by their husbands, or parents, than we might be looking at as many as 15-20,000 kids being denied an education. Kids that could be getting that education around the corner in their public school..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Mainstream schools are essential to develop social skills.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although we acknowledged in the advantages section that homeschooled children do still develop socially, they naturally lose some interaction by spending more time at home. They may be out of touch with their peers, have fewer friends, and have less experience interacting with people from different backgrounds. Their view of the world could be very narrow and biased. In the worst cases, they could be brought up to be intolerant and misinformed, with little knowledge of general societal values. This could disadvantage them in the future..
    - Evidence 2: There are also other experiences that homeschooled children miss out on. Schools offer work experience opportunities, the ability to participate in sports leagues, and opportunities for recognition and reward (for example, during assemblies). Those who are taught at home do not experience these things, and might feel as though they have missed out..
    - Evidence 3: Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Duke University tracked more than 700 children from across the US between kindergarten and age 25 and found a significant correlation between their social skills as kindergartners and their success as adults two decades later. The 20-year study showed that socially competent children who could cooperate with their peers without prompting, be helpful to others, understand their feelings, and resolve problems on their own, were far more likely to earn a college degree and have a full-time job by age 25 than those with limited social skills. Those with limited social skills also had a higher chance of getting arrested, binge drinking, and applying for public housing..
    - Evidence 4: Homeschooling opponents, such as Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet, argue for bans on homeschooling, saying it’s “important that children grow up exposed to community values, social values, democratic values, ideas about nondiscrimination and tolerance of other people’s viewpoints..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Mainstream schools are of higher educational quality.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In September 2006, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the German ban on homeschooling, stating 'parents may not refuse.. [compulsory schooling] on the basis of their convictions', and adding that the right to education 'calls for regulation by the State'..
    - Evidence 2: The National Education Association, a United States teachers' union and professional association, opposes homeschooling..
    - Evidence 3: Teachers are public schools are required to carry education degrees and they may have more experience working with and teaching children. Teaching a child is different from parenting a child and many parents struggle to do both..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for neglect and abuse..
    - Evidence 2: Stanford University political scientist Professor Rob Reich (not to be confused with former U.S. Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich) wrote in The Civic Perils of Homeschooling (2002) that homeschooling can potentially give students a one-sided point of view, as their parents may, even unwittingly, block or diminish all points of view but their own in teaching..
    - Evidence 3: By homeschooling, you are making it your responsibility to meet all your child’s educational needs. You have to be able to deliver the depth and breadth of learning that they require in order to meet their potential. This takes time and energy, even if you’re hiring tutors for some lessons; you will still need to ensure that they’re teaching effectively, and that they are suitable to have access to children. As part of this, you will need to take up references, and check that they have a DBS certificate. Homeschooling also involves preparing the child for any exams that they will sit, and taking them to external examination centres to sit them. This requires a lot of extra work, and examination centres might be far away from your home..
    - Evidence 4: In effect, you are adding two more jobs to your role as parent: you are also becoming a teacher and an administrator. As well as doing everything you do already, you have to plan and implement lessons, organise trips, coordinate activities with other parents, and make sure that you meet the local authority’s requirements. You will be spending a lot of time with your child – perhaps the whole day, every day – and you might not be able to do things that you normally do whilst they are at school. This can lead to stress and fatigue on your part..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","Summary of Debate Material:

On the other hand, proponents of the proposition ""Homeschooling should be banned"" have these main arguments:

Homeschools cannot be regulated or standardized. The lack of oversight and standardization in homeschooling raises concerns about the quality of education and the potential for neglect or abuse.

Mainstream schools are vital for developing social skills. They argue that attending a traditional school gives students a diverse social experience, and enables them to develop crucial social skills.

Mainstream schools typically have a higher educational quality. Evidence for this argument includes the endorsement of compulsory schooling by the European Court of Human Rights and the opposition to homeschooling by the National Education Association.

Parents are not always qualified as teachers. Proponents argue that homeschooling might give students a biased or one-sided worldview and may place a hefty responsibility on parents to meet all educational needs of their child. It implies that parenting skills do not necessarily equate to teaching skills, and that the burden of these added roles could lead to stress and fatigue for the parent."

Topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'

Opposing Argument Summary:

Argument: Routine child vaccinations or their side effects are dangerous.

Evidence: The CDC reports that vaccines like the one for chickenpox can cause pneumonia, and the flu vaccine may be associated with Guillain-Barr Syndrome, a disorder where the immune system attacks parts of the peripheral nervous system, in about one or two per million people vaccinated. Additionally, the Rotashield vaccine for rotavirus (RV) was withdrawn from the market after it potentially contributed to higher instances of intussusception (bowel obstruction).
Argument: Mandatory vaccination contradicts basic rights.

Evidence: Compulsory vaccination interferes with the human right of bodily integrity, a part of the right to private life enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. The First Amendment of the US Constitution also protects the free exercise of religion, which may include objections to vaccinations.
Argument: Routine child vaccinations are not necessary to keep children healthy.

","Debate Summary

Topic: 'Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory'

Supporting Argument Summary:

Argument: Routine child vaccinations are effective.

Evidence: Vaccinations prevent two to three million deaths each year worldwide, with an additional 1.5 million deaths preventable if all recommended vaccines were used. Major diseases like polio, smallpox, diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella, which caused hundreds of thousands of deaths yearly, decreased by 99% because of vaccinations.
Argument: Child vaccination saves lives.

Evidence: Full vaccination from birth to adolescence of all US children born in a year would save an estimated 33,000 lives and prevent 14 million infections. According to the CDC, childhood immunization prevented about 419 million illnesses, 26.8 million hospitalizations, and 936,000 early deaths of children born between 1994 and 2018.
Argument: Routine child vaccinations are necessary to protect others.

Evidence: Vaccination prevents disease outbreaks in communities. If the rate of vaccination within a population is greater than 92%, outbreaks of measles typically no longer occur. This is further supported by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Jacobson v. Massachusetts in 1905, which affirmed the public good over personal freedom.
Argument: Routine child vaccinations should be mandatory to prevent virus/disease spreading.

Evidence: Smallpox, a deadly disease which killed an estimated 300-500 million people in the 20th century, was eradicated by vaccination. Vaccination during pregnancy and of siblings also reduces the risk of spreading diseases like influenza and pneumococcus to infants.
Argument: Children should not suffer from preventable diseases.

Evidence: Vaccines prevent disease outbreaks and deaths from preventable diseases. After vaccination campaigns, diseases like smallpox, which killed one in seven children in Europe, was eradicated, and polio was nearly eradicated. Vaccine hesitancy, however, has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles."
Social media platforms should be regulated by the government,-1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government', Its opponents argue that:

    - Evidence 2: Another California legislation, Senate Bill No. 1001, was signed into law last September and will go into effect in July. It purports to address the role of bots in fake news and advertising. But the law’s definition of “bot” is too broad, and the method it uses is a poor match for the goal it seeks to accomplish..
    - Evidence 3: Legislation has a noticeable gap failing to hold the platform companies accountable for their management in data privacy, and calls to arms by legislators typically come after an identified breach yet quickly lose momentum..
    - Evidence 4: Like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, G.D.P.R. was hailed as landmark legislation. But since it took effect in 2018, there has been little action against Facebook, Google and others over their data-collection practices..
    - Evidence 5: Lack of enforcement of the European Union’s data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., has also cast a shadow over the new laws..
- claim_2: Social media regulation harms privacy.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Government use of SMMS or 'Social media monitoring software can be used to geographically track us as we communicate. It can chart out our relationships, networks, and associations. It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.'.
    - Evidence 2: On October 18, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was scheduled to begin using personal information collected using social media platforms to screen immigrants arriving in the U.S. The department made this new measure known in a posting to the Federal Register in September 2017, noting that '...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results...' would be included in an applicant's immigration file. This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates..
    - Evidence 3: Intervening with or removing content affects the rights to freedom of expression and privacy, and can easily lead to censorship..
    - Evidence 4: Some 81% of the public say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits, and 66% say the same about government data collection..

    - Evidence 2: Herbert Lin - Senior Research Scholar, Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University, said:' Government regulation to prevent the spread of misinformation and disinformation is neither desirable nor feasible. It is not desirable because any process developed to address the problem cannot be made immune to political co-optation. '.
    - Evidence 3: This trust exists in many contexts today—for example, many people trust weather reports. But when the president of the United States has freely extolled the virtues of “truthful hyperbole,” incorrectly altered NOAA weather maps predicting the path of a hurricane, and then pressured NOAA officials to state that their predictions were consistent with the altered map, it is clear that even weather reports are subject to political pressures..
    - Evidence 4: Around the US 2016 election, Russian entities set up and promoted fake Pages on Facebook to influence public sentiment — essentially using social media as an information weapon..
    - Evidence 5: We have seen political advertisements targeting minority communities during the 2016 election in the United States and in the United Kingdom to suppress voting and political participation. Ultimately, dark advertisements polarise voters, lower trust in institutions, and degrade the quality of our democracy..
","The topic in question is the proposition: 'Social media platforms should be regulated by the government'. The opponents of this topic presented five main arguments against it, supported by various forms of evidence.

Social Media Regulation is not Effective: This claim argues that attempts at regulation have failed in the past, citing the Online Harms White Paper of April 2019, which suggests that previous regulatory and voluntary initiatives did not sufficiently protect users. They also referenced issues with the enforcement of the California Senate Bill No. 1001 and the General Data Protection Regulation (G.D.P.R.) in Europe, both of which demonstrated limited efficacy in achieving their intended goals.

Social Media Regulation Harms Privacy: This argument is based on the premise that government regulation could infringe on personal privacy. Evidence includes the use of Social Media Monitoring Software (SMMS), which can track communication, relationships, and even geographic locations. Further evidence points to a 2017 Department of Homeland Security measure that involved collecting personal information through social media platforms to screen immigrants, a practice criticized by privacy advocates.

Social Media Regulation Harms Freedom of Speech and other Democratic Rights: This claim maintains that regulation may threaten freedom of expression and lead to censorship. The opponents referenced warnings from the Open Rights Group and Index on Censorship about potential harm to free speech. They also highlighted concerns from the Director of Thematic Engagement for UN Human Rights about countries jeopardizing human rights through online content regulation.

The Government Should not Intervene in the Affairs of a Private Company: The fourth claim contends that government intervention in private sector affairs can lead to inefficiencies and disruptions. No specific evidence was provided to support this claim, but it alludes to debates in the U.S. regarding government intervention and potential negative impacts on the market system.

Social Media Regulation can Lead to Political Abuses by the Government: The final argument asserts that regulation can be used for political manipulation and suppression. It draws on instances where content moderation practices on social media platforms disproportionately affected Palestinian voices. Also, it points to the U.S. 2016 election, where Russian entities used social media to influence public sentiment, demonstrating how easily these platforms can be weaponized for political gain.

Overall, the opponents argue that government regulation of social media platforms would not be effective and could potentially infrify on privacy, limit freedom of speech, interfere with the workings of private companies, and be misused for political ends."

    - Evidence 2: Also in 2020, EPIC and coalition of child advocacy, consumer, and privacy groups filed a complaint urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate and penalize TikTok for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act..
    - Evidence 3: Companies are obligated to comply with the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act if they know that children under age 13 use their platforms. The law, known as COPPA, gives parents control over what information online platforms can collect about their kids..
    - Evidence 4: Concerns about social media aggravating poor youth mental health have been reignited following the death of a young British teenager, Molly Russell, whose social media feeds were reportedly filled with distressing content. Russell’s father has commented that he has 'no doubt that Instagram helped kill [his] daughter'..
    - Evidence 5: ‘The government […] has a vital part to play and must act to put an end to the current ‘standards lottery’ approach to regulation. We concluded that self-regulation will no longer suffice.

Twitter has found 2,752 accounts established by Russian groups that tweeted 1.4 million times in 2016. The widespread nature of these disinformation efforts led Columbia Law School Professor Tim Wu to ask: ’Did Twitter kill the First Amendment?‘.

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If we believe news headlines, social media is responsible for many of the major scourges of modern life. It is coarsening our political discourse, leading to polarization and division. It exposes vulnerable people to extremist ideology, driving them toward violence. Social media is addictive, can damage our body image and sense of self-worth..
    - Evidence 2: Pending legislation like the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union, seek to make social media platforms more transparent, giving users and legislators insights into the algorithms that promote some and demote other content. Proposed regulations also seek to outlaw so-called dark patterns, psychologically manipulative techniques designed to make it difficult to leave a service or designed to keep users engaged with social media platforms, in the same way that gambling machines seek to keep gamblers in the casino..
    - Evidence 3: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'I’m unashamedly pro tech but that can’t mean a tech free-for-all. Today Britain is setting the global standard for safety online with the most comprehensive approach yet to online regulation. We are entering a new age of accountability for tech to protect children and vulnerable users, to restore trust in this industry, and to enshrine in law safeguards for free speech.'.
    - Evidence 4: Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said: 'This proportionate new framework will ensure we don’t put unnecessary burdens on small businesses but give large digital businesses robust rules of the road to follow so we can seize the brilliance of modern technology to improve our lives.'.
    - Evidence 5: Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom’s Chief Executive, said: ‘We’re really pleased to take on this new role, which will build on our experience as a media regulator. Being online brings huge benefits, but four in five people have concerns about it. That shows the need for sensible, balanced rules that protect users from serious harm, but also recognise the great things about online, including free expression. We’re gearing up for the task by acquiring new technology and data skills, and we’ll work with Parliament as it finalises the plans.’.

    - Evidence 2: The law, called the Digital Services Act, is intended to address social media’s societal harms by requiring companies to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content or risk billions of dollars in fines. Tech companies would be compelled to set up new policies and procedures to remove flagged hate speech, terrorist propaganda and other material defined as illegal by countries within the European Union..
    - Evidence 3: Home Secretary Priti Patel said: 'We will not allow child sexual abuse, terrorist material and other harmful content to fester on online platforms. Tech companies must put public safety first or face the consequences.'.
    - Evidence 4: Richard Pursey, Group CEO & Co-Founder of safety technology company Safe To Net, said: ‘Online safety is a fundamental human right. That is why we are so proud to support the UK Government, who are leading the way in tackling online harm. The forthcoming legislation marks a pivotal moment for online safety, one that we hope will mean social platforms are made safe by design. This action can’t come soon enough: As our lives continue to become more digital, ourselves and our children are increasingly exposed to online threats. The UK safety-tech industry is leading the way with SafeToNet playing its part to make online harms a thing of the past.’.
    - Evidence 5: For example, Pierre DeBois, founder of digital analytics consultancy Zimana, wrote in his list of 2021 social media trends that the rise of regulation is intensifying media scrutiny on the societal impact of social media, platform transparency and how users feel about all this. Put simply, he writes, enterprises need to pay closer attention to how social media platforms impact the real world by allowing, say, disinformation or hate speech to go unchecked, 'because the platform’s responses can and will influence how customers view your organization’s association with the platform.'.
- claim_5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Matthew Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, one of the companies that drove the National Socialists out, argued later that businesses lack the legitimacy to govern speech on their forums. He suggested that most people see government as the proper authority to suppress speech related to violence..
    - Evidence 2: According to the Pew Trust, 13 percent of Americans have had their social media accounts taken over by an unauthorized user. Such hacks can result in stolen information and forced shares that redirect followers to malware, among other things..
    - Evidence 3: Another rising concern, exacerbated by Cambridge Analytica’s breach of Facebook data, centers on how bad actors access private data from social media platforms and elsewhere and use it to manipulate opinions for the benefit of a few..
    - Evidence 4: For example, the Russian operation Internet Research Agency is accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential election of 2016 by using social media to spread disinformation that stirred up conflict and distrust..
    - Evidence 5: The survey found that online social network accounts had been subject to unauthorized access in 60 million cases in 2011..
","Topic: Social media platforms should be regulated by the government

Stance: Positive

Summary of Arguments and Evidence:

Claim 1: Social media regulation protects the younger audiences.

Evidence: Instances of violations and harmful effects on children, such as the exposure of children to pornographic content, the violation of the ChildrenÕs Online Privacy Protection Act by TikTok, and the tragic case of Molly Russell demonstrate the pressing need for better regulation. The inadequacy of self-regulation has led to calls for a statutory regulator that ensures online safety for children.

Claim 2: Social media regulation is necessary to deal with fake news.

Evidence: The prevalent mistrust in news organizations, the disturbing amount of fake content during the presidential campaign, and the disinformation campaigns by foreign entities emphasize the need for regulation. The European Union's legislation requiring tech companies to combat misinformation is a key example of such regulation.

Claim 3: Social media regulation is beneficial to society at large.

Evidence: The corrosive effects of social media on our society, ranging from political polarization to extremist indoctrination and self-esteem issues, underpin the necessity for regulation. Regulation measures like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act in the European Union aim to increase transparency and outlaw manipulative practices. Statements from Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden and OfcomÕs Chief Executive Dame Melanie Dawes highlight the balance that regulation brings, ensuring accountability and safety without impeding technological progress.

Claim 4: Social media regulation can help to deal with negative content.

Evidence: Legislation like the Digital Services Act mandates tech companies to more proactively police their platforms for illicit content. Proposals have been made to restrict social media algorithms that spread harmful content, and governments have expressed commitment to public safety, vowing to not tolerate harmful content on online platforms. Tech companies have expressed their support for legislation that makes social media safer by design.

Claim 5: Social media regulation is required to deal with malicious users.

Evidence: Instances of unauthorized account access, breaches of private data, and misuse of information by malicious entities emphasize the importance of regulation. The inappropriate use of social media for spreading disinformation, as seen in the Russian operation Internet Research Agency's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, underscores the urgency of this issue. The perception of governments as the legitimate authority to curb harmful speech further supports the need for official regulation."

    - Evidence 1: I struggle so much with this insane work culture in America. We are so freaking proud of working ourselves to death..
    - Evidence 2: Tina Marie Griffin said 'I mean how our culture misuses digital technology and how the media spreads false information. I mean sexual immorality, video game violence, social pressures, and the influence of music, television, and films. '.
    - Evidence 3: In a recent opinion piece for The New York Times, Anne-Marie Slaughter laments the state of the current American workplace, which she considers toxic by nature..
    - Evidence 4: The Modern culture of The US is one of little respect for one another. Most are only concerned about their own social status so that leaves little room to care about the dignity of others, and most of the times people will try to climb the social latter at the expense of others dignity..
    - Evidence 5: Cultural factors may be as important as these well-known health risks, according to a study that appeared last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Vol. 295, No. 17, pages 2037-2045). Simply living in America may be as risky as a diet of doughnuts and beer, researchers suggest..
- claim_4: The US has high taxation/high costs of living.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Americans with less than five-figure incomes pay an effective payroll tax rate of 14.1 percent, while those making seven-figure incomes or more pay just 1.9 percent..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers estimate, for example, that 80 percent of families saw the share of budgets dedicated to spending on needs such as housing and health care increase by more than 7 percentage points between 1984 and 2014, potentially crowding out spending on other categories like leisure, longer-term investments in education, and saving for retirement..
    - Evidence 3: Further, a 2019 Pew survey found that 35 percent of middle-income families frequently worry about paying their bills; similarly, 37 percent worry about the cost of health care for themselves and their families..
    - Evidence 4: While prices of some services and goods have fallen substantially, especially when bearing in mind increases in their quality, others—particularly prescription drugs, childcare, and education—have risen substantially, and in many cases, faster than incomes over the last several decades..
    - Evidence 5: Almost half (47%) of Americans believe that cost of living is the biggest threat to their financial security and long-term investments, according to TD Ameritrade’s financial disruptions survey, which polled over 1,000 U.S. adults with at least $10,000 in investable assets..
- claim_5: The US has inequality/poverty.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The ownership of wealth among households in the U.S. became somewhat more concentrated since the 1980s. The top 10% of households controlled 68.2 percent of the total wealth in 1983 and 73.1% of the total wealth in 2007..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers recently tested 355,000 White and 77,000 Black Americans and discovered a strong link between a fear of diseases and implicit/explicit racial bias. The tests found that 'among white people who are highly averse to germs, images that evoke thoughts of infectious disease also increase bias against African Americans.'.
    - Evidence 3: From the U.S. Census Bureau, the official poverty rate in 2020 was 11.4 percent, up 1.0 percentage point from 10.5 percent in 2019..

    - Evidence 5: The United States’ Gini coefficient was forty in 2019—the same as Bulgaria’s and Turkey’s, and significantly higher than that of Canada, France, and Germany—according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of advanced economies..
- claim_6: The US is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: The US has the highest rate of death by guns in the developed world, and more than double the gun ownership rates than Yemen, a country that has been embroiled in a civil war since 2014..
    - Evidence 2: More Americans have been killed by guns since 1968 than soldiers have died in all of America’s wars combined..
    - Evidence 3: An astounding 1.5 million Americans died by gunfire between 1986 and 2017..
    - Evidence 4: A country where, according to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been 253 mass shootings in the country since the beginning of 2019. That’s more shootings than days. Two of those occurred over the weekend in less than 24 hours, first in El Paso, Texas followed by Dayton, Ohio, leaving 31 dead..
    - Evidence 5: Despite the high employment opportunities, the US still slipped from 20th to 21st place for general quality of life. Reibstein said the main reason for the decline was because just 11% of respondents regarded the US as safe — a significant decline from last year's 38% figure..

    - Evidence 4: Sociologists Pam Jackson and Jason Cummings’ research documents that middle-class Blacks have worse health profiles than working-class whites. They attribute this difference to the daily racialized trauma experienced in predominately white environments like work and neighborhood settings..
    - Evidence 5: Racial discrimination continues to be in the labor market. An experiment carried out in Chicago and Boston during 2001 and 2002 shows that resumes with “white-sounding” names, whether male or female, were much more likely to result in call backs for interviews than were those with “black-sounding” names (even though the resumes were otherwise identical)..
","Topic: 'The USA is a good country to live in'

Stance: Opponents

Unfair Health and Education Policies:
Critics argue that the US has unfair health and education policies. They point out the high cost of medical care, citing evidence that about a quarter of adults or their family members have had to forego prescribed medication due to cost. The impact is particularly pronounced among the uninsured, low-income households, and racial minorities, with higher proportions reporting difficulty affording healthcare costs.

Problematic/Divisive Political System:
Detractors argue that the US has a divisive political system, as evidenced by deeply entrenched party lines. For instance, the approval of the US's handling of the coronavirus outbreak varied vastly between Republicans and non-Republicans. This political divide, reinforced by alignments of ideology, race, and religion, is argued to be more profound in the US than in other nations.

Negative Culture:
Critics state that the US fosters a negative culture, characterized by an extreme work culture, misuse of digital technology, and media spread of false information. The culture is also blamed for fostering disrespect towards others in pursuit of social status and for creating a work environment deemed toxic by some.

High Taxation/High Costs of Living:
Critics assert that the US's high taxation and high costs of living contribute to financial instability. Evidence includes the disproportionate tax rates for low versus high-income earners and the growing portion of family budgets dedicated to needs such as housing and healthcare. Rising costs of essential goods and services, coupled with stagnant incomes, create economic stress for many American households.

Inequality/Poverty:
Critics argue that the US suffers from significant inequality and poverty. Evidence includes the concentration of wealth among the top 10% of households and the rising official poverty rate. Racial biases also contribute to inequality, as does the high Gini coefficient, indicating wealth disparity akin to countries like Bulgaria and Turkey.

Unsafe:
Critics argue that the US is unsafe, citing the high rate of deaths by firearms as a major concern. They point to statistics such as more Americans having been killed by guns since 1968 than soldiers in all US wars combined, and the high incidence of mass shootings as evidence of an unsafe environment.

Xenophobic/Racist:
Critics argue that the US exhibits xenophobia and racism, pointing to the high number of immigrant deportations and reported racial slurs or attacks against Asian Americans since the start of the pandemic. Systemic racism is highlighted as an issue, with evidence of racial discrimination in the labor market and poorer health outcomes among middle-class Blacks compared to working-class Whites."

The vow of celibacy should be abandoned,-1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Celibacy allows a priest to focus on God.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Above all, Paul VI states that the human person is more than simply flesh, and that any true call to a life devoted to God that includes celibacy will also be aided by God's own grace to sustain it: The true, profound reason for dedicated celibacy is, as We have said, the choice of a closer and more complete relationship with the mystery of Christ and the Church for the good of all mankind: in this choice there is no doubt that those highest human values are able to find their fullest expression.
    - Evidence 2: By freeing himself from other obligations, Paul teaches that a priest is thereby freer to devote himself to God. He also says that the increased solitude away from the demands of wife and family may nourish a priest's spiritual life..
    - Evidence 3: Garry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life.
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of clerical celibacy answer that God only calls men to the priesthood if they are capable. Those who are not called to the priesthood should seek other paths in life since they will be able to serve God better there..
    - Evidence 5: Advocates see clerical celibacy as a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour..
- claim_2: Celibacy is a strong religious belief.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Thus, from the Church's beginnings, clerical celibacy was 'held in high esteem' and is considered a kind of spiritual marriage with Christ, a concept further popularized by the early Christian theologian Origen..
    - Evidence 2: Sacerdotalis caelibatus (Latin for Of priestly celibacy) is an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI..
    - Evidence 3: In 1074, mandatory celibacy of the clergy became canon law as part of Pope Gregory VII's effort to eliminate several forms of medieval church corruption..
    - Evidence 4: Supporters of celibacy claim that Roman Catholic priests suffering sexual temptations are not likely to turn immediately to a teenage boy simply because Church discipline does not permit clergy to marry..
    - Evidence 5: Later, when the secular clergy was recruited largely from among married men, this custom became almost universal, for, as the episcopal office could not be conferred upon men who were married, it developed, in a way, into a privilege of the religious who had taken the vow of celibacy..
- claim_3: Celibacy makes the priests to be perceived as holy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: According to an obituarist 'he treated women with a detached courtesy as of a celibate priest..
    - Evidence 2: Although the Pope upholds the sanctity of the sacrament of marriage, he rejects the notion that it is the only reasonable path available to a person. Rather, the love that feeds a priest's choice of celibate life also draws on God:  His charity is drawn from the purest source, practiced in the imitation of God and Christ, and is no less demanding and real than any other genuine love. It gives the priest a limitless horizon, deepens and gives breadth to his sense of responsibility - a mark of mature personality - and inculcates in him, as a sign of a higher and greater fatherhood, a generosity and refinement of heart which offer a superlative enrichment..
    - Evidence 3: In 387 or 390, or according to others in 400, a Council of Carthage decreed that bishops, priests and deacons abstain from conjugal relations: It is fitting that the holy bishops and priests of God as well as the Levites, i.e. those who are in the service of the divine sacraments, observe perfect continence, so that they may obtain in all simplicity what they are asking from God; what the Apostles taught and what antiquity itself observed, let us also endeavour to keep.. It pleases us all that bishop, priest and deacon, guardians of purity, abstain from conjugal intercourse with their wives, so that those who serve at the altar may keep a perfect chastity..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Priests choose to be celibates.

    - Evidence 1: Paul, says Laurent Cleenewerck, a priest of the Orthodox Church in America and professor of theology at Euclid University, clearly favored celibacy, which he understood as a gift. Cleenewerck supports this statement by quoting , Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. This I say by way of concession, not of command. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am..

","In summarizing the opposition against the abandonment of the vow of celibacy, there are six key claims.

The first claim is that celibacy allows a priest to focus on God. Evidence is drawn from religious texts, the writings of Paul VI and Garry Wills, among others, all of which suggest that celibacy enhances a priest's relationship with God, provides an opportunity for spiritual enrichment, and ensures a higher performance in religious services, akin to the life led by Jesus Christ.

The second claim defends celibacy as a long-held religious belief. Evidence for this includes the 'Sacerdotalis caelibatus,' an encyclical written by Pope Paul VI, and the Church's tradition that views celibacy as a spiritual marriage with Christ. Furthermore, celibacy has been canon law since 1074 as part of Pope Gregory VII's reform to eliminate church corruption.

The third claim is that celibacy enhances the holiness of priests. Various sources are quoted suggesting that celibacy symbolizes a higher and greater form of love, drawing from God, thereby marking mature personality and refined heart in priests.

The fourth claim argues that priests choose to be celibates voluntarily. Evidence cited includes texts from theologian Laurent Cleenewerck and others, which state that celibacy is a personal choice often embraced by those who wish to lead a life similar to Apostle Paul or as dictated by their religious beliefs.

The fifth claim asserts that religious experiences and traditions should be maintained. Several historical evidences are cited where celibacy is revered, including direct references from Pope Siricius, and how it is deeply ingrained in the Church's tradition since the early centuries.

Finally, the sixth claim posits that removing celibacy could lead to sexually reckless acts. Evidence for this includes a report by the Church's Truth, Justice and Healing Council in Australia, which suggests that mandatory celibacy might have been a contributing factor to child sexual abuse incidents within the Catholic Church. Similarly, the Archbishop of Vienna has also linked celibacy to the sex abuse scandals within the Church, calling for a thorough examination of the potential causes of such acts."

","Summary:

Debate 1: 'The vow of celibacy should be abandoned'

Positive supporters for the abandonment of celibacy argue:

Celibacy is outdated: Historical evidence for mandatory priestly celibacy is ambiguous and under continuous debate, as demonstrated by Cardinal Archbishop Emmanuel Clestin Suhard's discussions and the reforms proposed by the Jednota Union in 1890. This view is supported by those such as Lakeland, who believes a change in the practice is inevitable.

Celibacy is too pressuring/difficult: It's argued that celibacy imposes hardships on those who take the vow, as exemplified by the hardship of some nuns after the closure of their convents. The suppression of sexual urges and the lack of a life partner are considered challenges, potentially leading to warped behaviors.

Celibacy is unhealthy/unnatural: Protestants argue that celibacy contradicts Biblical teachings, as stated in the First Epistle to Timothy. John Wass, a Professor of Endocrinology at Oxford University, claims celibacy is ""a totally abnormal state,"" potentially linked to health issues like prostate cancer.

Celibacy leads to wrong sexual behaviour: Supporters of the argument suggest a correlation between celibacy and sexual abuse, pointing out numerous sexual abuse allegations against Catholic priests and deacons in the US in 2004. Noted figures like Christoph Schnborn and Hans Kng argue that priestly celibacy could contribute to such scandals.

Celibacy reduces the pool of people wanting to become priests: Mandatory celibacy has reportedly contributed to a shortage of priests, with figures like Joseph Matthew Breitenbeck advocating for ending clerical celibacy to address this issue."
We should abandon marriage,-1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should abandon marriage', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Marriage benefits children.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: One  of  the  factors  that  influence  adolescent  psychological  well-being  is  the role  of  family and  parents.  In  general,  parental  marriage  contributes  to  the  well-being  of  children  (Ribar, 2015) because  of  the financial  support between  husband and  wife, social  interaction between family members, and  stability  of  the relationship  between  parents who  are  bound  in marriage commitments.  Shek  et  al.  (2014)  found  that  parental  marital  conditions,  family  functioning, relationships  between  children  and  parents,  and  communication  patterns  affect  the  level  of psychological well-being  of  adolescents..
    - Evidence 2: Children raised in intact married families tend to earn higher grades than those in non-intact families.1) For example, kindergarten children from married families have higher reading scores than those from cohabiting families.2) Parents in always-intact married families are also more likely to help their children do their homework than are parents in stepfamilies or single-parent families,3) and fathers in always-intact married families are more involved in their children’s homework than are stepfathers.4) Compared with children in stable married families, students experiencing parental divorce have lower academic expectations and test scores.5).
    - Evidence 3: Plenty of research indicates that healthy marriage positively impacts children and society. And despite growing up with examples of unhealthy marriages, divorce or other adverse childhood experiences, it’s possible to heal from the past and have healthy relationships and even healthy marriages..
    - Evidence 4: Children raised in intact married families:are more likely to attend college,are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to be physically or sexually abused,are less likely to use drugs or alcohol and to commit delinquent behaviorshave a decreased risk of divorcing when they get married, are less likely to become pregnant/impregnate someone as a teenager.
    - Evidence 5: Children receive gender specific support from having a mother and a father. Research shows that particular roles of mothers (e.g., to nurture) and fathers (e.g., to discipline), as well as complex biologically rooted interactions, are important for the development of boys and girls (Marriage and the Public Good: Ten Principles, 2006)..
- claim_2: Marriage is important for people, either generally or because of religious/traditional reasons.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Throughout the ages, governments of all types have recognized marriage as essential in preserving social stability and perpetuating life. Regardless of whether marriages were performed as a religious rite or a civil ceremony, in almost every culture marriage has been protected and endorsed by governments primarily to preserve and foster the institution most central to rearing children and teaching them the moral values that undergird civilization..
    - Evidence 2: Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. Marriage is the beginning—the beginning of the family—and is a life-long commitment. It also provides an opportunity to grow in selflessness as you serve your wife and children. Marriage is more than a physical union; it is also a spiritual and emotional union. This union mirrors the one between God and His Church..
    - Evidence 3: Marriage is designed for purity. We face temptation nearly every minute and from all directions. The bond of marriage gives us the support to defeat temptation by engaging in deep, satisfying love—a love that gives to, and receives from, our mate physically, emotionally, and spiritually..
    - Evidence 4: When a marriage produces a child or receives a child through adoption, it is one of life’s greatest blessings. Roughly 40% of children being raised today are in a home without a father. The effects of that fact are staggering. Father absence causes increases in mental and behavioral disorders as well as criminal activity and substance abuse. But when children are raised in a healthy marriage, they get a front row seat to see and experience the lasting benefits of a strong family.
    - Evidence 5: Marriage is designed to mirror our Creator’s unconditional love for us. It’s a love that will always be there and will never leave us or forsake us. When a man and woman love one another unconditionally, contentment and joy follow..
- claim_3: Marriage makes people happy.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Even middle-aged people, who generally tend to be unhappier than people in other stages of life, according to Science Daily, were able to enjoy an elevated level of happiness if they were married. Marriage may help ease the causes of a mid-life dip in life satisfaction and the benefits of marriage are unlikely to be short-lived, Helliwell explained..
    - Evidence 2: It’s not marriage that makes you happy, it’s happy marriage that makes you happy, Gilbert said. Married people are happier than unmarried ones, perhaps because the single best predictor of human happiness is the quality of social relationships. Marriage seems to buy you a decade or more of happiness, Gilbert said..
    - Evidence 3: Other recent research, however, has challenged this pessimistic view. Data from a large British panel survey show that marriage increased long-run happiness, suggesting that selection isn’t the whole story. Perhaps marriage doesn’t make Germans happy, but it does seem to make the English happy. Likewise, a paper using panel data from Taiwan has found somewhat more durable positive effects of marriage (though this there was a lot of variety in happiness trajectories, and Christians might get more happiness from marriage than other people)..
    - Evidence 4: The cautious answer to this question is, yes: married people do appear to be happier than people who are not married, including people who are never married..
    - Evidence 5: The larger issue is that people who are happy with their lives are also more likely to get married..
- claim_4: Marriage makes the couple closer.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Those who are married are more likely than those who are cohabiting to say they have a great deal of trust in their spouse or partner to be faithful to them, act in their best interest, always tell them the truth and handle money responsibly..
    - Evidence 2: Married adults are also more likely than cohabiters to say they feel closer to their spouse or partner than to any other adult.
    - Evidence 3: The survey also examines how adults who are married and those who are living with an unmarried partner are experiencing their relationships. It finds that married adults are more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners than those who are cohabiting..
    - Evidence 4: Love and marriage advice: Couples need to constantly work on their relationship to have a healthy and happy marriage..
    - Evidence 5: Each decision you as a couple can successfully make together brings you closer to each other..
- claim_5: Marriage provides important financial benefits.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: One of the most obvious financial advantages of marriage is income splitting. The goal of income splitting is to shift income from a higher income partner to a lower income partner. For couples with different income levels and different marginal tax rates, income splitting can create a sizable tax advantage..
    - Evidence 2: One advantage is that spouses can transfer money and assets between them other tax-free, which can reduce your overall tax bill..
    - Evidence 3: There are yet more savings to be had when it comes to inheritance tax. When one of you dies, any money or assets passed on are free from inheritance tax if you’re married..
    - Evidence 4: While the standard deduction is higher for a couple, combining your income could impact some of your deductions if you itemize..
    - Evidence 5: When an unmarried person includes a partner on their health insurance plan, that benefit is taxable. For married couples, premiums to cover both are tax deductible..
","Debate 2: 'We should abandon marriage'

Opponents to the abandonment of marriage argue:

Marriage benefits children: Evidence shows children in married families tend to have higher psychological well-being, earn higher grades, and are less likely to engage in delinquent behaviors. It's also argued that a mother and a father provide gender-specific support critical to the development of children.

Marriage is important for people: Marriage is regarded as essential for social stability and life perpetuation. It's seen as a spiritual and emotional union, fostering purity, unconditional love, and the opportunity for selflessness. It is also believed that marriage mirrors the Creator's unconditional love for us.

Marriage makes people happy: Several studies suggest that married people are generally happier than their unmarried counterparts. A happy marriage is said to provide a quality social relationship that positively impacts happiness levels.

Marriage makes the couple closer: Marriage is associated with higher levels of trust and closeness between spouses. Married adults reportedly feel more satisfied with their relationship and more trusting of their partners compared to those cohabiting.

Marriage provides important financial benefits: The financial advantages of marriage include income splitting, tax-free transfer of money and assets, inheritance tax benefits, and tax-deductible premiums for joint health insurance coverage. These benefits potentially result in substantial savings for married couples."

- claim_1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Roughly one in three girls in Zimbabwe is married by her eighteenth birthday. Discriminatory social norms that link a girl’s perceived “purity” to her family’s honor are among the factors that push girls into marriage. According to Human Rights Watch, young women and girls who become pregnant, stay out late, are seen in the company of suspected boyfriends, or are otherwise thought to be sexually active can be forced into marriage in order to preserve their familial honor..
    - Evidence 2: Paul Dolan claims that women might be happier if they stay single..
    - Evidence 3: As soon as my relationships turned serious and steady, men started to expect too much and offer too little. It was self-understood that I, as a woman, would take care of the home, wait for him gladly while he would be god knows where doing god knows what, and deal with his jealousy on the top of that..
    - Evidence 4: Unmarried women tend to be happier, healthier, and live longer didn't come as a surprise..
    - Evidence 5: A growing body of evidence shows that the effects of marriage today are worse for women than for men. Also, the negative effects of bad marriage are even worse for women and it’s thus not surprising that women initiate a large majority of divorces..
- claim_2: Marriages are unstable.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Alison, for instance, found that her husband would go out with his friends at the weekend while she stayed at home, preparing lessons and doing the housework. Then there are factors that have the capacity to bring everything to a head. Money is one. “He’d say, ‘Well, you chose to have a low-paid job,’” Alison says. By then they’d had a (planned and wanted) baby, and children are another acknowledged marriage stressor. They bring high strain (in terms of finances, fatigue and housework) and often highlight different standards of care. “It wasn’t an easy time,” Alison says. “It reinforced just how different we were. Before, when we argued, I just thought, ‘Well, we’ll make up a few hours later.’ But when you’ve got a child, you don’t want to be falling out all the time..
    - Evidence 2: When we zoom out and look at the large-scale picture at the global or regional level since the 1970s, we see an overall increase in divorce rates. The UN in its overview of global marriage patterns notes that there is a general upward trend: “at the world level, the proportion of adults aged 35-39 who are divorced or separated has doubled, passing from 2% in the 1970s to 4% in the 2000s.”.
    - Evidence 3: Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers looked in detail at the changes and driving forces in marriage and divorce rates in the US.14 They suggest that the changes we see in divorce rates may be partly reflective of the changes in expectations within marriages as women entered the workforce. Women who married before the large rise in female employment may have found themselves in marriages where expectations were no longer suited. Many people in the postwar years married someone who was probably a good match for the postwar culture, but ended up being the wrong partner after the times had changed. This may have been a driver behind the steep rise in divorces throughout the 1970s and 1980s..
    - Evidence 4: You might have heard the popularised claim that “half of marriages end in divorce”. We can see here where that claim might come from – it was once true: 48% of American couples that married in the 1970s were divorced within 25 years..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Qatar’s laws require women to have male guardian permission to marry, regardless of age or former marital status. When a woman is married, guardianship transfers from her father to her husband. The Family Law provides that she can be deemed “disobedient” if she does not obtain her husband’s permission before working, traveling, or if she leaves her home or refuses to have sex with him, without a “legitimate” reason. A few women who fled their marriages after years of abuse told Human Rights Watch their husbands filed claims at court that they had been disobedient which can mean they lose their right to financial support from their husband..
    - Evidence 2: It seems appropriate to start not with the end of marriages, but instead with the laws that governed marital relations. Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience..

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: It's such a dominant approach to love and partnership and so ingrained into the very fabric of many societies today, monogamy may seem like simply the way relationships work..
    - Evidence 2: In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 3: From a health perspective, one of the big advantages of monogamy is the reduced risk for contracting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like HIV, gonorrhea and herpes. There are ways to get STDS other than sex, such as intravenous drug use in the case of HIV. In most cases the chances of contracting one are extremely low, unless you or your partner previously had an STD. Non-monogamous people are at a higher risk for contracting STDs due to involvememtn with multiple partners and those who may or may not know or wish to share their history of STDs..
    - Evidence 4: Intimacy means having a deep personal connection with someone. One advantage of monogamy is that it fosters emotional intimacy, supporting two people in developing a strong, affectionate relationship. In a monogamous relationship, most people expect the search for a partner to be over, building a solid, intimate relationship that will stand the test of time..
    - Evidence 5: Knowing that a partner will always prioritize time and personal investment to a single person leaves that person with greater confidence that the emotional dynamics and support system will retain it’s stability. More so than it would with someone who divides time and personal investment between multiple partners who may have changing needs and wants..
","Debate Summary:

Topic: 'We should abandon marriage'

Stance: In support of abandoning marriage

Claim 1: Marriage preserves norms that are harmful for women.

Evidence: The harmful social norms in places like Zimbabwe, forcing young girls into marriage to uphold perceived family honor. Additionally, studies suggest that unmarried women tend to be happier and healthier, living longer lives. Furthermore, the negative impacts of marriage, especially unstable or unpleasant ones, are disproportionately more severe on women.
Claim 2: Marriages are unstable.

Evidence: This claim is supported by increasing global divorce rates over the past few decades, which have nearly doubled. Changing societal expectations, especially in the context of women entering the workforce, have contributed to this instability. For instance, women who married before the rise in female employment may find that their marriages were not equipped to handle these shifts in societal norms, leading to increased divorce rates.
Claim 3: Marriages tie up people with unfair obligations.

Evidence: Some countries, like Qatar, require women to have male guardian permission to marry, transferring guardianship from her father to her husband upon marriage. These restrictions and obligations can lead to significant restrictions on women's rights and freedoms. Even within the legal framework governing marriages, there is often an inherent bias towards inequality, demonstrated by the historic use of marital coercion as a justification for crime.
Claim 4: Most of the advantages of marriage are achieved by a monogamous relationship.

Evidence: Monogamous relationships can provide many of the benefits traditionally associated with marriage, such as emotional intimacy and stability, without some of the constraints and societal pressures that can accompany marriage. From a health perspective, monogamous relationships also offer lower risks for contracting sexually transmitted diseases. A monogamous relationship can still provide a sense of commitment and emotional security."

    - Evidence 2: The Department of Education (DofE) has found increasing evidence that schools which strictly enforce uniform policies experience fewer incidences of bullying, as potential bullies find it harder to identify their targets, who often are those children who do not fit in..
    - Evidence 3: The study, commissioned by Trutex in association with The Diana Award, found nine out of ten teachers (89%) believe school uniforms play an active role in reducing bullying..
    - Evidence 4: Staffordshire Live readers have declared that school uniforms should not be scrapped because poorer families might not be able to afford the latest clothing trends and their children might become the target of bullies..
    - Evidence 5: Research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers thought 'a good school uniform… could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: B.R. international Public School shows that alongside featuring unity, uniforms likewise promote equality. Envision the circumstance without school uniforms. Students would show up in garments of their decision. Regardless of the amount we attempt, this will ingrain inequality- kids from rich foundations would wear their marked garments and adornments, while other students would build up a feeling of inadequacy..
    - Evidence 2: Uniforms not only unify students’ appearances, but they also create a sense of unity in terms of community. A student in a uniform feels they belong to their school and that their school belongs to them. They boost school pride and spirit..

    - Evidence 2: In 2018, the Schoolwear Assiciation conducted a series of focus groups with pupils from Year 7 and Year 9 to get the inside views on uniforms. We found that many pupils chose to remain in their uniform outside of school to complete homework. Most children explained that it helped them stay focussed while they worked, keeping them in the ‘school mindset’. While non-uniform days may be exciting, our research found that pupils viewed them as ‘non-work’ days, and teachers reported a drop in behavior standards as a result..

Using those figures, the average American family is encountering a figure approaching, and in some cases surpassing, $300 per child for back-to-school clothing. Contrast that figure with the cost of a year's worth of school uniforms:one year (five tops and five bottoms) of school uniform or standardized dress code clothing is $150. Therefore families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes!If these savings are applied over a 12-year career, each child could save $1800! These savings are more than enough to help students prepare for college expenses, when money is tight due to rising tuition costs..

","Topic: We should abandon the use of school uniforms

Opponents' Stance: School uniforms should not be abandoned

The opponents of abandoning school uniforms present five main arguments:

Children can still express themselves using other means. An ex-student at Hershey High School argues that uniforms do not stop students from being themselves. They can wear expressive items like buttons or jewelry. Moreover, a study shows that 54% of eighth graders felt that they could still express themselves despite following a school uniform policy.

School uniforms reduce bullying. A Department of Education (DofE) finding indicates that schools with strict uniform policies experience fewer bullying incidents, as bullies find it harder to target children who don't fit in. Moreover, research by the Schoolwear Association found that 83% of teachers believed that a good school uniform could prevent bullying based on appearance or economic background.

School uniforms create a sense of equality/unity. Uniforms not only standardize students' appearances but also promote community unity. A Texas survey reported significantly positive perceptions of belonging among uniformed students. Uniforms symbolize group membership, thereby creating a sense of inclusion for those wearing them.

School uniforms encourage discipline or focus on learning. As Natasha Irshad notes, one of the significant distractions in schools without a uniform policy is focusing on others' wardrobes. Kids often focus more on peers' clothes than on studying. A study indicated that 70% of principals believed that mandated school uniforms reduced disciplinary problems at their schools.

School uniforms save costs. A comparison of clothing costs by the NY Post reveals that families can save at least $150 per child on back-to-school clothes by opting for school uniforms. A UK study further supports this, demonstrating that the average school uniform is cheaper than the average non-school outfit. A national survey of US school leaders found that 94% of those surveyed believe school uniforms are more cost-effective than regular apparel."

  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: The people who make up the rules for uniform requirement have false beliefs that the student body will be better because it has to look the same. That sounds more like a post-apocalyptic society in which we are all forced to think the same and have no choices in our lives from the day we are born, similar to novels such as Anthem and Fahrenheit 451..
    - Evidence 2: As Tara Maginnis Ph.D. wrote “school uniforms send early-life messages to students that conformity is important and creativity is not, that authority is allowed to abuse its power and constrain our constitutional right to free speech and expression..

    - Evidence 2: One study carried out at Arizona State University confirmed this. It found that students from school without a school uniform policy had a higher self-perception than those from schools which forced students to wear uniforms..
    - Evidence 3: According to Dr. Alan Hilfer, child psychologist at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, this may lead to situations in which teenage students start resenting uniforms, undermining the whole purpose of the measure..
    - Evidence 4: To some extent, it runs counter to the freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 5: Robyn Silverman, a child and teenager development specialist, told NBC News' Today show: 'As a body image expert, I hear from students all the time that they feel it (wearing uniforms) allows for a lot of comparison. ... So if you have a body that’s a plus-size body, a curvier body, a very tall body, a very short body, those girls often feel that they don't look their best.'.
- claim_3: School uniforms are expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The article called ‘ School Uniforms,’ stated 'Many parents may have to make financial sacrifices or rely on financial aid to pay the tuition at a private school. In such cases, expensive uniforms can be viewed as a financial burden that disproportionately affects students from low-income households. Some vendors have gained reputations for filling orders slowly and providing poor customer service while charging exorbitant prices.'.

  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: For example, many types of clothes popular among female students (especially during hot weather) are considered to be “sexually suggestive” (“School dress codes,” 2017, para. 7). According to the proponents of such rules for teenage girls, short skirts and similar clothes contribute to sexual crime in schools (“School dress codes,” 2017)..
    - Evidence 2: Dr Johanna Reidy from Otago’s Department of Public Health says girls are forced to wear uniforms that stop them from being active during breaks or cycling to school..
    - Evidence 3: A researcher from the University of Otago says a radical redesign of uniforms is needed.  Students are often made to wear school uniforms that leave them too hot in summer, too cold in winter and are physically restrictive for girls..
    - Evidence 4: Says Laura Bates, a co-founder of The Everyday Sexism Project. “There’s a real culture being built up through some of these dress codes where girls are receiving very clear messages that male behavior, male entitlement to your body in public space is socially acceptable, but you will be punished.”.
    - Evidence 5: According to a recent GLSEN study, 19 percent of LGBT students were prevented from wearing clothes that were thought to be from another gender and that number was even higher for transgender students, nearly 32 percent of whom have been prevented from wearing clothes that differed from those designated for their legal sex..

Her story was reported in National Catholic Reporter of March, 2002, and she said, 'Everyone hated it. It completely killed any sense of individuality any one of us had. Everyone looked the same. It was sad to watch'..
    - Evidence 2: According to Grace Chen of the Public School Review, forced conformity may leave students ill prepared to enter the adult world where appearance matters even if uniforms are not required..
    - Evidence 3: 'School uniforms only reinforce the notion that authority and obedience matter most, which does not factor into dressing appropriately for a job in an adult career field' contends Scott Key of Fresno State University..
    - Evidence 4: Uniforms could delay an adolescent's transition into adulthood. A quote states that “Adults make their own clothing choices and have the freedom to express themselves through their appearance..
    - Evidence 5: Research has shown that getting to dress themselves in what they want not only encourages independent thinking in kids and teens, but it also prepares them for adulthood when they have to learn to adapt to shifting social standards and contexts—skills that will serve them well as adults. When they prepare for their first college visits, job interviews, internships or promotions, they will need to know how to make appropriate choices..
","Topic: We should abandon the use of school uniform.

Stance: Positive.

Argument 1: School uniforms harm learning and creativity. Supporters of this argument cite a resemblance to dystopian societies where conformity is enforced, as seen in the works of literature like Anthem and Fahrenheit 451 (Evidence 1). Experts like Tara Maginnis Ph.D. argue that school uniforms instill in students the belief that conformity takes precedence over creativity, and that authority has the right to curtail their rights to free speech and expression (Evidence 2).

Argument 2: School uniforms harm a student's self-expression. Evidence in support of this argument includes the U.S. Supreme Court's 1969 ruling stating that neither students nor teachers relinquish their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at school (Evidence 1). Further research shows that students attending schools without uniform policies had higher self-perception (Evidence 2), while others like Dr. Alan Hilfer, child psychologist, suggest that the enforcement of uniforms could lead to student resentment (Evidence 3).

Argument 3: School uniforms are costly. Studies suggest that the imposition of uniforms does not save parents money, but rather, increases their expenditure on clothes (Evidence 2). The financial burden is even more pronounced for low-income households (Evidence 1), with some parents resorting to cutting back on essentials or going into debt to afford them (Evidence 3).

Argument 4: School uniforms can be uncomfortable and may perpetuate sexism. Several criticisms are raised about uniform policies, such as their potential to limit physical activity in girls (Evidence 2), cause discomfort due to weather-inappropriate clothing (Evidence 3), and propagate a culture of male entitlement over female bodies (Evidence 4). The issue extends to the LGBTQ+ community, with a significant percentage of students being prevented from wearing clothes associated with a different gender (Evidence 5).

Argument 5: School uniforms harm individuality and promote harmful conformity. A student testimony reveals the suppression of individuality due to uniform policies (Evidence 1). Experts like Grace Chen argue that such forced conformity can hinder students' preparedness for adult life, where individuality and personal expression often matter (Evidence 2). Research shows that allowing children to make their own dressing decisions fosters independent thinking and helps them adapt to changing social standards in adulthood (Evidence 5)."

Capital punishment can help bring closure for victims’ families, deter other would-be murderers, and express the moral outrage of our society for the most atrocious crimes. Consider the case of Daniel Lewis Lee, one of the five convicted murderers whose execution will now proceed. Lee belonged to a white-supremacist group called the Aryan People’s Revolution… Simple justice demands that Daniel Lewis Lee and murderers like him face the ultimate punishment, which truly fits the crime. Further, the death penalty in this case warns criminals to stop short of murder, lest they face execution. The death penalty also ends a horrific and prolonged period of pain and justice delayed for a victim’s loved ones–in a case where Lee doesn’t even deny his guilt..

    - Evidence 2: Charles Stimson, JD, Acting Chief of Staff and Senior Legal Fellow of the Heritage Foundation, in a Dec. 20, 2019 article, The Death Penalty Is Appropriate, available at heritage.org, stated: That said, the death penalty serves three legitimate penological objectives: general deterrence, specific deterrence, and retribution. The first, general deterrence, is the message that gets sent to people who are thinking about committing heinous crimes that they shouldn’t do it or else they might end up being sentenced to death. The second, specific deterrence, is specific to the defendant. It simply means that the person who is subjected to the death penalty won’t be alive to kill other people. The third penological goal, retribution, is an expression of society’s right to make a moral judgment by imposing a punishment on a wrongdoer befitting the crime he has committed. Twenty-nine states, and the people’s representatives in Congress have spoken loudly; the death penalty should be available for the worst of the worst..
    - Evidence 3: Armstrong Williams, Owner and Manager of Howard Stirk Holdings I & II Broadcast Television Stations, in a May, 25, 2021 article, “The Death Penalty Remains the Strongest Deterrent to Violent Crime,” available at thehill.com, stated: There must be some form to hold murderers accountable and, historically, the death penalty has been the most effective way of doing so. It could very well be that a firing squad is the most humane way, especially compared to lethal injection, where there have been cases of prisoners experiencing excruciating pain for sometimes over an hour. These examples are certainly worthy of our consideration and discussion. But one thing is clear: We still need the death penalty, if for no other reason, as a deterrent for other potential criminals..
    - Evidence 4: David Muhlhausen, PhD, Research Fellow in Empirical Policy Analysis at the Heritage Foundation, stated the following in his Oct. 4, 2014 article “Capital Punishment Works: It Deters Crime,” available at dailysignal.com: Some crimes are so heinous and inherently wrong that they demand strict penalties – up to and including life sentences or even death. Most Americans recognize this principle as just… Studies of the death penalty have reached various conclusions about its effectiveness in deterring crime. But… the majority of studies that track effects over many years and across states or counties find a deterrent effect. Indeed, other recent investigations, using a variety of samples and statistical methods, consistently demonstrate a strong link between executions and reduced murder rates… In short, capital punishment does, in fact, save lives..
    - Evidence 5: Hashem Dezhbakhsh, PhD, Professor of Economics at Emory University, and Joanna Shepherd, PhD, Associate Professor of Law at Emory University, wrote in their July 2003 study The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment: Evidence from a ‘Judicial Experiment' in Economic Inquiry: There is strong evidence for the deterrent effect of capital punishment… Each execution results, on average, in eighteen fewer murders with a margin of error of plus or minus ten. Tests show that results are not driven by tougher sentencing laws and are robust to many alternative specifications… The results are boldly clear: executions deter murders and murder rates increase substantially during moratoriums. The results are consistent across before-and-after comparisons and regressions regardless of the data’s aggregation level, the time period, or the specific variable used to measure executions… Executions provide a large benefit to society by deterring murders..
","The opponents of abolishing capital punishment put forward three primary arguments:

The first claim is that the death penalty helps the victims and their families attain closure and justice. Evidence for this assertion includes statements from Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina, who championed the reinstatement of the death penalty in his state. He asserts this will offer justice and closure to the victims' families. Similarly, Leslie Rutledge, Arkansas Attorney General, and US Senator Tom Cotton, argue that capital punishment not only brings closure for the victims' families but also deters potential murderers, thus helping to safeguard society.

The second argument presented by opponents is that the death penalty is acceptable in severe crime cases. However, the provided evidence does not directly support this claim. For instance, Tony Blair's statement against the death penalty even for Saddam Hussein does not align with the pro-death penalty argument. Similarly, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) and UN Sub-Commission's condemnations of certain executions contradict the claim rather than support it.

The third claim suggests that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to crime. Bolte's view supports this, arguing that capital punishment discourages violent crime. Charles Stimson from the Heritage Foundation also highlights this point, saying the death penalty serves as both a general deterrent (discouraging potential criminals) and a specific deterrent (preventing the sentenced individual from committing further crimes). Armstrong Williams, a broadcast television owner, and David Muhlhausen, a research fellow, also uphold this view, emphasizing the death penalty's role in crime prevention. The deterrent effect is further supported by a study from Emory University, which claims that each execution results in fewer murders.

In summary, the primary arguments opposing the abolition of the death penalty revolve around the belief that it offers closure to victims' families, should be applied in cases of severe crimes, and functions as a significant deterrent to violent crime. While the first and third claims have supporting evidence, the evidence provided for the second claim does not directly support the argument."

    - Evidence 5: The death penalty system in the US is applied in an unfair and unjust manner against people, largely dependent on how much money they have, the skill of their attorneys, race of the victim and where the crime took place.  People of color are far more likely to be executed than white people, especially if thevictim is white. Innocent people are too often sentenced to death.  Since 1973, over 156 people have been released from death rows in 26 states because of innocence.  Nationally, at least one person is exonerated for every 10 that are executed..

The vast majority of law enforcement professionals surveyed agree that capital punishment does not deter violent crime; a survey of police chiefs nationwide found they rank the death penalty lowest among ways to reduce violent crime..
    - Evidence 3: A 2010 study by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts concluded that the median cost of a federal death penalty case was nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case. The average cost for the defense in a federal death penalty trial is $620,932, and that figure does not include the cost incurred by the courts, investigative staff, the jury, and expert witnesses. Mandel also underscored that federal death penalty cases divert resources from other cases. She wrote, If a government employee must devote 1,000 hours to seek a death sentence but only 100 hours to obtain a life without parole sentence pursuant to a plea agreement, that 900 hours could have been devoted to other cases. Mandel concluded, The citizens of New Mexico rejected the death penalty, in part because it requires diverting resources that could be allocated to programs that better increase public safety, health and welfare..

    - Evidence 1: Emmaline Soken-Huberty, freelance author, in an undated article, 5 Reasons Why The Death Penalty is Wrong, accessed on Sep. 2, 2021 and available at humanrightscareers.com, stated: The fact that it doesn’t prevent crime may be the most significant reason why the death penalty is wrong. Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it..
    - Evidence 2: Craig Trocino, JD, Director of the Innocence Clinic at the University of Miami School of Law, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: The death penalty is not a deterrent despite the claims of its proponents. In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it..
    - Evidence 3: Nick Petersen, PhD, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Law at the University of Miami, as quoted by Robert C. Jones Jr. in an Aug. 8, 2019 article, The Impact of Reviving the Federal Death Penalty, available at news.miami.edu, stated: Social science research does not support the contention that the death penalty deters crime. In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that “available studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.” A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion. Citing a number of problems with deterrence research, the council reported that “claims that research demonstrates that capital punishment decreases or increases the homicide rate by a specified amount or has no effect on the homicide rate should not influence policy judgments about capital punishment..
    - Evidence 4: John J. Donohue III, JD, PhD, Professor of Law at Stanford University, stated the following in his Aug. 8, 2015 article There’s No Evidence That Death Penalty Is a Deterrent against Crime, available at theconversation.com: There is not the slightest credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the rate of homicide. Whether one compares the similar movements of homicide in Canada and the US when only the latter restored the death penalty, or in American states that have abolished it versus those that retain it, or in Hong Kong and Singapore (the first abolishing the death penalty in the mid-1990s and the second greatly increasing its usage at the same), there is no detectable effect of capital punishment on crime. The best econometric studies reach the same conclusion… Last year roughly 14,000 murders were committed but only 35 executions took place. Since murderers typically expose themselves to far greater immediate risks, the likelihood is incredibly remote that some small chance of execution many years after committing a crime will influence the behaviour of a sociopathic deviant who would otherwise be willing to kill if his only penalty were life imprisonment. Any criminal who actually thought he would be caught would find the prospect of life without parole to be a monumental penalty. Any criminal who didn’t think he would be caught would be untroubled by any sanction..
    - Evidence 5: H. Lee Sarokin, LLB, former US District Court and US Court of Appeals Judge, wrote in his Jan. 15, 2011 article Is It Time to Execute the Death Penalty? on the Huffington Post website: In my view deterrence plays no part whatsoever. Persons contemplating murder do not sit around the kitchen table and say I won’t commit this murder if I face the death penalty, but I will do it if the penalty is life without parole. I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences. Statistics demonstrate that states without the death penalty have consistently lower murder rates than states with it, but frankly I think those statistics are immaterial and coincidental. Fear of the death penalty may cause a few to hesitate, but certainly not enough to keep it in force..
","The debate material revolves around the topic 'We should abolish capital punishment'. Supporters of this stance have raised several arguments, each accompanied by substantial evidence.

Their first argument is that state-sanctioned killing is principally wrong. They highlight that, as per Amnesty International, the death penalty is the ultimate, irreversible denial of human rights. Citing specific examples such as the halt of executions by Judge Fogel and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Atkins v. Virginia, they underscore the notion that execution constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The risk of executing an innocent person is another critical concern, with evidence showing that 143 US death row prisoners have been completely exonerated since 1976. The unfair application of the death penalty, biased against the poor and people of color, further strengthens this claim.

The second argument is that the death penalty disproportionately harms the disenfranchised. A Persian daily's call to abolish capital punishment is cited as a representative voice from affected communities. Further, evidence is presented that capital punishment does not deter violent crime and that it's a drain on public resources. The median cost of a federal death penalty case is nearly eight times greater than a non-death penalty case, suggesting that these resources could be better allocated to programs that increase public safety, health, and welfare.

The final argument revolves around the irreversibility of the death penalty. Data is presented that disputes the idea of capital punishment as a deterrent to crime. The Southern US, which oversees 81% of the nation's executions, has the highest murder rate. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. Additional studies show that the majority of criminologists don't believe in the death penalty's deterrence effect. Furthermore, states that have recently abolished the death penalty have not seen an increase in murder rates. Echoing this sentiment, Professor John J. Donohue III, states that there is no credible statistical evidence that capital punishment reduces the rate of homicide. The risk of executing an innocent person and its irreversible consequences underscores this argument.

In sum, the proponents of abolishing capital punishment argue on the grounds of principle, socio-economic fairness, and the irreversibility of the penalty. They use robust evidence, including legal precedents, statistical data, and expert opinions, to support these arguments."

","Debate Summary

Topic: We should abolish intellectual property rights.

Stance of the Opponents:

Intellectual property rights incentivize creativity/innovation: Opponents argue that intellectual property rights drive innovation, citing the work of organizations like UPOV which encourage plant variety development and various scholars who hold that copyright remains a critical means for artists and inventors to fund the creation of new works (Claim 1, Evidence 1 & 2). They contend that intellectual property laws encourage disclosure of innovation for the public good (Claim 1, Evidence 3).

Intellectual property rights incentivize investment in developing new products: There is an argument that without intellectual property protections, intangible assets would be under-produced due to insufficient incentives for commercial organizations. The WIPO and the United Nations University research project found a positive correlation between the strengthening of IP systems and economic growth (Claim 2, Evidence 3 & 5).

Intellectual property rights protect against stealing: Opponents maintain that intellectual property rights protect against intellectual property violations and support the global trade system, as evidenced by initiatives like the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Operation In Our Sites (Claim 3, Evidence 1 & 2).

People, or a business, own their innovations and should be able to be compensated for their endeavour: They also hold that intellectual property rights ensure that innovators get a fair return on their investment and contribute significantly to the economy, as evidenced by the high value added per employee in IP-intensive industries (Claim 4, Evidence 2 & 4)."

    - Evidence 2: Murray Rothbard argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain..
    - Evidence 3: Stallman argues that the term intellectual property is designed to confuse people, and is used to prevent intelligent discussion on the specifics of copyright, patent, trademark, and other laws by lumping together areas of law that are more dissimilar than similar..

    - Evidence 1: The duration increased from an average of 32.2 years to 95 (for copyrights owned by corporations) between 1974 and 2004, and it may yet be extended further, in violation of the constitutional requirement that the exclusive rights be for limited times.  The scope has increased from regulating only publishers to now regulating just about everyone..
    - Evidence 2: Lateef Mtima, director of the Institute for Intellectual Property and Social Justice at Howard University School of Law, expressed concern that users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable themselves, saying, Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the bill is that the conduct it would criminalize is so poorly defined..

","Debate Summary

Topic: We should abolish intellectual property rights.

Stance of the Supporters:

Intellectual property prevents the continuous improvement of a service/product: Supporters of the abolition argue that intellectual property laws can hinder innovation, as they may discourage competitors from improving in areas covered by patents and monopolies in the form of copyrights and patents can harm health and prevent progress (Claim 1, Evidence 2 & 5).

Intellectual property restricts access to important information/products: They contend that intellectual property rights have increasingly begun to regulate everyone and prevent the free exchange of ideas, thus restricting access to important information and products (Claim 2, Evidence 1 & 3).

Intellectual property rights are unfair: Advocates for abolition assert that intellectual property rights are not libertarian and infringe on freedom of speech and the press, rendering them unfair (Claim 3, Evidence 3).

Intellectual property rights harm creativity/innovation: Supporters argue that overprotecting intellectual property is harmful and that in a free culture, innovators are able to create without fear of infringing on intellectual property rights (Claim 4, Evidence 1 & 4).

Intellectual property rights waste money: They also believe that enforcing intellectual property rights can create social costs and result in financial waste, particularly for complex products involving designs and processes (Claim 5, Evidence 2 & 3).

Intellectual property rights are ineffective: Supporters point out that intellectual property rights are a legal fiction created by the state and that they can only be implemented by limiting others' physical property rights, making them ineffective (Claim 6, Evidence 1 & 2)."

In a 5-4 decision, the Court, citing the intentions of the framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment, held that the Second Amendment applies to the states through the incorporation doctrine..
    - Evidence 2: In 2022, the Supreme Court further expanded upon the precedent set by Heller in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. In Bruen, the Court struck down a New York law requiring parties interested in purchasing a handgun for the use of self-defense outside of the home to obtain a license because the law issued licenses on a “may-issue” rather than a “shall issue” basis. This “may issue” licensing method allowed state authorities to deny interested parties public use licenses for firearms if the interested party was unable to show “proper cause” as to why they have a heightened need for self-protection over the general population..
    - Evidence 3: In a 5-4 vote Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court declared for the first time that the Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right of individual Americans to keep and bear arms. The court said gun ownership is an individual right, not connected with military service, and that it can be regulated in some ways..

","Topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms'

Opponents Stance:

Claim: Gun control is ineffective

Evidence: A 2016 Bureau of Justice Statistics study revealed that only about 10.1% of criminals obtained their firearms through a legal retail source. Moreover, an analysis of data from 1981-2000 found no significant effect of comprehensive background checks on homicide rates in California.
Claim: Gun ownership is a right

Evidence: The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has been interpreted to protect the right to bear arms, as affirmed by court cases such as McDonald v. City of Chicago and New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. For many Americans, the right to own guns is seen as essential to their sense of freedom.
Claim: Gun ownership is necessary for hunting/sports-shooting

Evidence: A considerable portion of gun owners cite hunting and sports-shooting as their primary reasons for owning firearms. For instance, a 2013 Pew Research report found that 32% of gun owners owned guns for hunting, and 7% for target or sport shooting.
Claim: Gun ownership promotes self-protection

Evidence: Many U.S. states constitutionally protect the right to bear arms for self-defense. Surveys reveal that the majority of gun owners feel safer owning a gun, and a considerable number of criminals avoid committing crimes when they know the victim is armed."

","Topic: 'We should abolish the right to keep and bear arms'

Positive Supporters Stance:

Claim: Banning guns would save lives

Evidence: Studies have shown correlations between higher gun ownership and increased rates of firearm-related homicides. For example, research from the Harvard School of Public Health found that states with higher gun ownership levels have higher rates of homicide.
Claim: Gun ownership allows for mass-shootings/general gun violence

Evidence: Increased presence of firearms often escalates volatile situations, potentially leading to violent outcomes. Studies show that guns often used in conflicts are those readily available, and households with guns have a higher risk of homicides.
Claim: Guns can fall into the wrong hands

Evidence: The presence of more guns can stimulate burglary and theft, as they can be quickly sold at a high fraction of their initial cost. Illegally possessed guns have been involved in numerous mass shootings, and a significant portion of firearms used in crime were obtained from family or friends.
Claim: Guns lead to accidental deaths

Evidence: The risk of unintentional shootings, especially among children and adolescents, significantly increases in households with firearms. The data reveals a high correlation between gun ownership and accidental firearm injuries and deaths. Safety measures akin to those used for other potentially dangerous items like medicines or swimming pools are not commonly applied to firearms."
We should adopt an austerity regime,-1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt an austerity regime', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Austerity cuts access to essential services.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are warning signs that acute budget and service pressures can encourage a retreat to silos or ‘passing the buck’, particularly at the operational level..
    - Evidence 2: The UK’s largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, has documented a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. In that decade this food bank network went from distributing just under 26,000 parcels a year to handing out more than 1.33 million of them..
    - Evidence 3: Our analysis of government data shows that the budget allocated for welfare for children and families has borne the brunt of public expenditure cuts, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018..
    - Evidence 4: “Taking care of ‘at risk’ children is a mandatory concern. However, youth centres and outreach services are considered unessential and have been cut to the bone. Yet these are services that help prevent children becoming ‘at risk’ in the first place,” said Gray..
    - Evidence 5: “For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimate that even if the government locks in a moderate overall spending increase over the next five years, because of commitments to protect certain areas of spending, the remaining ‘unprotected’ areas - including most aspects of social security, prisons, local government and adult education - are facing an average annual cut of 0.4 per cent per year..
- claim_2: Austerity extend recessions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The use of austerity measures during times of economic hardship has caused much controversy about their purpose and usefulness. Many economists have pointed out that the measures have contractionary effects and usually exacerbate ongoing economic recessions..
    - Evidence 2: In Argentina, Russia, and Turkey, for example, many high-level government officials resigned when mistimed austerity packages did more harm than good for their economies..
    - Evidence 3: For instance, interest rates on Greek debt fell following its first bailout. However, the gains were limited to the government having decreased interest rate expenses. Although the private sector was unable to benefit, the major beneficiaries of lower rates are large corporations. Consumers benefited only marginally from lower rates, but the lack of sustainable economic growth kept borrowing at depressed levels despite the lower rates..
    - Evidence 4: “If he wants to reassure the markets, he will have to announce early action in the form of a big fiscal tightening. That could deepen and/or lengthen the recession and ultimately create an even bigger fiscal hole,” said Ruth Gregory, senior U.K. economist at Capital Economics..
    - Evidence 5: The financial press and many economists have pointed to austerity policies that cut government expenditures and increased tax rates as an explanation for the slow recovery in several European countries (e.g. Blanchard and Leigh 2013, Krugman 2015)..
- claim_3: Austerity is unfair to the citizens.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Margaret Greenwood, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The government should listen to the people being pushed into poverty by its policies. Universal credit is failing miserably, leaving families in debt, [in] rent arrears and at risk of becoming homeless. Three million children are growing up in poverty despite living in a working household..
    - Evidence 2: Universal credit has punched us in the face. Before much longer people will turn to crime. People will smash the windows to get what they want. This is going to cause riots – Denise Hunter, 57, at the West End food bank in Newcastle-on-Tyne.
    - Evidence 3: I got hungry because I was smelling the other food. I had to take my eyes away from it. The most unfair thing is the government knows families are going through hard times but they decide not to do anything about it – John Adebola-Samuel, 12, whose family couldn’t get school meals in Dumfries, Scotland, because of their immigration status.
    - Evidence 4: I was 18 [and homeless] and the council said I was not a priority. I was struggling with depression and anxiety and juggling work. I was told that if I stop work and have a baby I would be more likely to get housing – Tayah, west London..
    - Evidence 5: IMF-required austerity is significantly associated with rising inequality, by increasing the income share to the top ten percent at the expense of the bottom 80 percent. Unsurprisingly, the impact can also be seen in significantly rising poverty levels in countries facing tighter austerity requirements..
- claim_4: Austerity results in lower growth.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In exchange for bailouts, the EU and European Central Bank (ECB) embarked on an austerity program that sought to bring Greece's finances under control. Greece's deficit has dramatically decreased, but the country's austerity program has been a disaster in terms of healing the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Austerity undermined improving public finances and suppressed tax revenues, with cumulative government borrowing through to 2023-24 now likely to be double (+£450bn) the original plan to get it down to zero in five years..
    - Evidence 3: Because the evidence shows that austerity strangled the green shoots of economic recovery that were sprouting when the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition took office..
    - Evidence 4: On average, pay growth halved across OECD countries in the nine post-crisis years compared to the nine pre-crisis years..
    - Evidence 5: The OECD average slowing from 5 per cent before the crisis to 2.5 per cent after the crisis, with the UK down from 4 to 2 per cent. For many countries – including the UK – price rises mean that the standard of living has fallen over the last decade..
- claim_5: Austerity results in lower job creation.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Cutting government spending, many believe, leads to large-scale unemployment. Robust public sector spending, they suggest, reduces unemployment and therefore increases the number of income-tax payers..
    - Evidence 2: Recently, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) released their World Employment Social Outlook for 2016. In this document they provide additional details on the global outlook for the near future. Between 2014 and 2016 the unemployment rate in European countries averaged between 10.2 and 9.2%..
    - Evidence 3: Countries like Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Spain are affected up to the point where basic rights like access to jobs, the right to work, etc. are under threat. Greece and Spain’s unemployment rates for example are respectively 25.6% and 22.9%..
    - Evidence 4: In 2012, the World of Work Report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO),stated that women have a higher probability of being unemployed or finding themselves in vulnerable employment positions in comparison to men. According to the ILO, they face systemic barriers in nearly all aspects of employment. As a side effect which cannot be underestimated or ignored, the austerity measures further enforce these barriers. These barriers are all in regard to; receiving ample childcare, the level of pay, the access to higher-paying traditionally “male” occupations, job security, pension entitlement, benefits, etc..
    - Evidence 5: Alessandro Turrini finds that contrary to expectations, austerity policies may have been responsible for creating more unemployment in countries with stronger employment protection legislation. One potential reason for this is that while countries with more regulated labour markets have not experienced as many redundancies from austerity, they have also had far lower job creation levels..
","The given debate material examines the topic ""We should adopt an austerity regime,"" focusing specifically on the viewpoint of opponents to the idea. The opponents propose the following arguments:

Austerity cuts access to essential services: This perspective is supported by multiple pieces of evidence, including data from the UKÕs largest national food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, which noted a 5,146 percent increase in emergency food parcels distributed between 2008 and 2018. Further, it is argued that budgets for welfare for children and families have been significantly impacted, falling by 44 percent between 2010 and 2018.

Austerity extends recessions: Critics suggest that austerity measures can worsen economic recessions. Evidence includes examples such as Argentina, Russia, and Turkey where mistimed austerity packages reportedly caused more harm than good. Also, numerous economists and financial press have associated austerity policies with a slow recovery in several European countries.

Austerity is unfair to the citizens: Opponents argue that austerity measures can lead to increased poverty and income inequality. They point to individual stories of people being driven into poverty and towards criminality due to measures like the Universal Credit system in the UK. The IMF-required austerity is also associated with rising inequality and poverty levels.

Austerity results in lower growth: Critics argue that austerity can hurt economic growth. One piece of evidence cited is Greece's experience with austerity, which resulted in a significant decrease in the country's deficit but did not lead to economic recovery. Austerity is also linked to suppressed tax revenues and reduced standard of living in OECD countries.

Austerity results in lower job creation: Critics say austerity measures can lead to large-scale unemployment. Evidence includes data from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) showing high unemployment rates in European countries. Furthermore, austerity measures are seen as exacerbating systemic barriers to employment, particularly for women, leading to higher unemployment rates.

In summary, critics argue that austerity measures can harm access to essential services, exacerbate recessions, increase poverty and inequality, stifle economic growth, and reduce job creation. They believe that austerity regimes should not be adopted as a policy solution due to these potential negative impacts."

    - Evidence 4: On the basis of Arellano (2008) model simulations we find that cutting government consumption may indeed raise the default premium in the short run. This is not because investors are impatient or schizophrenic about austerity. Rather, this is because with output being temporarily reduced due to austerity, financial market participants understand that a government is tempted to default on its debt obligations in order to free scarce resources from debt service for other expenditures..

Harding responded by cutting the federal budget by almost 50%. Tax rates were reduced for all income groups, and the debt dropped by more than 30%. In a speech in 1920, Harding declared that his administration 'will attempt intelligent and courageous deflation, and strike at government borrowing...[and] will attack high cost of government with every energy and facility.'.

Topic: ""We should adopt an austerity regime.""

Stance: Positive support

Argument 1: Austerity improves the economic measures.

Supporters of austerity point to economic growth in countries such as Latvia and Estonia as evidence that fiscal austerity can lead to recovery (e.g., Latvia showed a fast growth of 5.1% in the past 12 months at Q1 2012).
High budget deficits can result in higher bond yields, as seen in Greece, Spain, and Ireland, leading to an increase in national debt.
Research from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina highlights the benefits of 'expansionary austerity' as fiscal policy changes in advanced economies between 1970 and 2007 often associated spending cuts with economic expansions rather than recessions.
Argument 2: Austerity is important in the long term.

By cutting budget deficits, investors gain confidence about the long-term performance of the economy, encouraging private sector investment. For example, the EU commission reported falling deficits in Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg, and Sweden in 2012, showing that austerity measures were working.
Economists argue that austerity is necessary to reduce budget deficits and is compatible with improving long-term economic performance.
Argument 3: Austerity increases stability.

Countries such as Morocco have experienced steady growth in the services and industrial sectors due to astute monetary policy and falls in international commodity prices, despite being heavily indebted in the past. Austerity measures and pro-market reforms have contributed to these positive outcomes.
Reductions in wages and public expenditure can negatively impact domestic demand but can also lead to an increase in exports and macroeconomic stability. This model of austerity has been successfully implemented in countries like Germany.
Argument 4: Austerity is necessary to reduce deficits or pay debts.

As of the global financial crisis, national debt in advanced economies remains high, with examples like Japan and Greece where the ratio exceeds 185 percent of GDP. Austerity measures like wage bill cuts and freezes, introduction of value-added tax (VAT), and general public expenditure cuts have been proposed to tackle this issue.
The budget deficit of the UK, which was at 11% of GDP in 2009-10, has been reduced to about 5.5% with austerity measures, and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicts a surplus by the end of the decade.
Argument 5: Austerity regime is essential in economically troubled times.

Greece, despite facing economic hardships, has implemented an impressive austerity regime, achieving a fiscal tightening of about 20% of GDP and reducing its budget deficit by nine percentage points.
The United States, between 1920 and 1921, is considered a successful model of austerity in response to a recession, where federal budget cuts and tax rate reductions led to a drop in debt by more than 30%."

We should adopt atheism,1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should adopt atheism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Atheism is beneficial to the person that adopts it.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves-to be able to discern, for example, that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one's religion instructs it-and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations..
    - Evidence 2: Being an atheists often comes with contradictory ideologies that the society thrusts upon people but on the inside, atheists are free of conflicting ideas. They do not need to debate almost every time some stranger comments or offends any religion for they not believe in religion. They do not ever get into heated debates about which religion is better than the other..
    - Evidence 3: They believe in scientific explanations and do not dwell on mythologies that are most of the time impossible to believe in unless you are a blind follower. Their reasons and concepts are clear and they are happy about whatever they believe to be true. Satisfaction at heart is the most important thing people seek and atheism brings it in the most literary and non-mythical way..
    - Evidence 4: Every religion has some facts included in their sacred books that lead to controversy unless the person gives up reasoning and accepts just what the book has to say. Atheists are free of these confusions. They do not have to fight their own religious concepts to make them accept that theirs is the most supreme form of religion in the whole world. No gory details of what would happen if you don’t pray is one of best advantages that atheists get to live with..
    - Evidence 5: I have heard from atheists that they find it really blissful for not having to worry about your privacy being invaded by an invisible someone who keeps an eye on whatever you are doing and thinking and totally judging you for it. Keeping morals intact, you are totally free to do whatever you want to do without having to worry about two little fellows writing your books of good deeds and sins. Added advantage indeed..
- claim_2: Atheism should be adopted since we cannot prove that God exists.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: A few years ago, in a conversation with fellow atheist Peter Boghossian, Richard Dawkins admitted that no evidence would convince him of God’s existence as he could always explain it away..
    - Evidence 2: A metaphysically courageous atheist might try a more direct line of attack. He might acknowledge that God is not understood by theists to be a part of the physical universe and therefore is not the kind of thing that could be observed. Nevertheless, he might maintain that it is not rational to believe in what is not observable. Therefore, if by “God” we mean something inherently unobservable, then belief in him is inherently irrational. It is not simply that the “God hypothesis” fails an empirical test; it fails even to be a meaningful hypothesis. Such an argument, if successful, would have the benefit (from the atheist’s point of view) of ruling out not only belief in God but also belief in a host of other things that many atheists find suspect, from minds to objective moral values..
    - Evidence 3: Atheist Michael Scriven insists we need not have a proof that God does not exist in order to justify atheism. Atheism is obligatory in the absence of any evidence for God's existence..
    - Evidence 4: Theodore Drange (2006)  has developed an argument that if God were the sort of being that wanted humans to come to believe that he exists, then he could bring it about that far more of them would believe than currently do.  God would be able, he would want humans to believe, there is nothing that he would want more, and God would not be irrational.  So God would bring it about that people would believe.  In general, he could have brought it about that the evidence that people have is far more convincing than what they have.  He could have miraculously appeared to everyone in a fashion that was far more compelling than the miracles stories that we have.  It is not the case that all, nearly all, or even a majority of people believe, so there must not be a God of that sort..
    - Evidence 5: J.L. Schellenberg (1993) has developed an argument based upon a number of considerations that lead us to think that if there were a loving God, then we would expect to find some manifestations of him in the world.  If God is all powerful, then there would be nothing restraining him from making his presence known.  And if he is omniscient, then surely he would know how to reveal himself.  Perhaps, most importantly, if God is good and if God possesses an unsurpassable love for us, then God would consider each human’s requests as important and seek to respond quickly.  He would wish to spare those that he loves needless trauma.  He would not want to give those that he loves false or misleading thoughts about his relationship to them.  He would want as much personal interaction with them as possible, but of course, these conditions are not satisfied.  So it is strongly indicated that there is no such God..
- claim_3: Religions are immoral and people should not follow them.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: If you are following a list of rules, you are being obedient, not moral. Religion confuses obedience with morality. Morality is actually thinking about the consequences of your actions and how they affect other people. If you’re not doing that, and instead following the rules in a old book, then you are being obedient. Obedience is amoral. At best! An argument can be made that obedience is utterly irresponsible because by ceding your autonomy to the rules you follow you demonstrate that you don’t care how your actions affect others..
    - Evidence 2: Religion is immoral because it is a lie. There are no gods. No heaven . No hell. It is immoral to lie to billions of people to manipulate them and take their money..
    - Evidence 3: Of all the modern religions, Christianity is possibly the most immoral. It sets unrealistic expectations, talks about punishment, has an OT history of wiping out whole nations of people, is responsible for the crusades and the indecent forced conversion of millions around the world, perpetrated violence against Muslims and other non-Christian nations, talks about a god who will send you into a fiery hell, because you, his supposed creation, does not cow-tow to his need for devotion, and sees priests, pastors and ministers take sexual advantage of their followers, whether children, female or married. A close second would have to be the Muslim religion with similar beliefs and atrocious actions (female genital mutilations anyone?) and a complete intolerance of apostates. And that’s only scratching the surface..
    - Evidence 4: Some if not all religions can be immoral in that the particular religions teach people to do horrible things. For example, the Bible teaches people how to treat their slaves. Yes, there are some who say that that’s a metaphor, but there are some who take it literally and there was a time when fewer people, maybe even no one, took it as a metaphor..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Science can adequately explain the Universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness. ..
    - Evidence 2: A 2010 survey found that those identifying themselves as atheists or agnostics are on average more knowledgeable about religion than followers of major faiths..
    - Evidence 3: An atheist before Darwin could have said, following Hume: I have no explanation for complex biological design. All I know is that God isn't a good explanation, so we must wait and hope that somebody comes up with a better one. I can't help feeling that such a position, though logically sound, would have left one feeling pretty unsatisfied, and that although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. The Blind Watchmaker (1986).
    - Evidence 4: Stephen Weinberg, Nobel Prize winner in the quarks and leptons area, is one who is hostile to faith. Lennox quotes him more extensively on p18 of Gunning for God.

Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.'.

    - Evidence 2: Both, say Steven Telesopen in new window and Brink Lindseyopen in new window, who visited Stanford Graduate School of Business recently as part of its Corporations and Society Initiative. Teles, a left-leaning professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University, and Lindsey, a libertarian-leaning researcher at the Washington, D.C., think tank Niskanen Center, coauthored The Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality. The authors critique laws and regulations that they believe result from poor policymaking practices and ultimately suppress economic growth and hurt the public. While the two authors ask conservatives to recognize that income inequality threatens growth, they also show liberals that government regulation, if misguided or badly constructed, can do more harm than good by increasing inequality..
    - Evidence 3: The validity of right-libertarian notions of liberty and economic freedom have been questioned by critics such as Robert Lee Hale, who posits that laissez-faire capitalism is a system of aggressive coercion and restriction by property owners against others..
    - Evidence 4: Adam Smith's obvious and simple system of natural liberty is not a system of liberty at all, but a complicated network of restraints, imposed in part by individuals, but very largely by the government itself at the behest of others on the freedom of the some. ... What in fact distinguishes this counterfeit system of laissez-faire (the market) from paternalism, is not the absence of restraint, but the absence of any conscious purpose of the part of the officials who administer the restraint, and of any responsibility or unanimity on the part of the numerous owners at whose discretion the restraint is administered..
    - Evidence 5: Right-libertarians are accused of ignoring market failures, although not all proponents are market zealots. Critics of laissez-faire capitalism, the economic system favored by right-libertarians, argue that market failures justify government intervention in the economy, that nonintervention leads to monopolies and stifled innovation, or that unregulated markets are economically unstable. They argue that markets do not always produce the best or most efficient outcome, that redistribution of wealth can improve economic health and that humans involved in markets do not always act rationally..
- claim_2: Libertarianism harms minorities/those who are worse off.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Some advocates of right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this inconsistency in modern societies arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive enslavement contracts, rejecting the notion of inalienable rights: The comparable question about an individual is whether a free system will allow him to sell himself into slavery..
    - Evidence 2: According to philosopher James P. Sterba, the liberty of the poor should be morally prioritized in light of the fundamental ethical principle ought implies can from which it follows that it would be unreasonable to ask the poor to relinquish their liberty not be interfered with, noting that in the extreme case it would involve asking or requiring the poor to sit back and starve to death and that by contrast it would not be unreasonable to ask and require the rich to sacrifice their liberty to meet some of their needs so that the poor can have the liberty to meet their basic needs. Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement. He concludes by arguing that the application of these principles to the international context makes a compelling case for socialist distribution on a world scale..
    - Evidence 3: In his essay 'From Liberty to Welfare', philosopher James P. Sterba argues that a morally consistent application of right-libertarian premises, including that of negative liberty, requires that a libertarian must endorse the equality in the distribution of goods and resources required by a socialist state. Sterba presents the example of a typical conflict situation between the rich and poor in order to see why libertarians are mistaken about what their ideal requires. He argues that such a situation is correctly seen as a conflict of negative liberties, saying that the right of the rich not to be interfered with in the satisfaction of their luxury needs is morally trumped by the right of the poor not to be interfered with in taking from the surplus possessions of the rich what is necessary to satisfy their basic needs..

- claim_3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: This is even more vividly seen when we look at an actual historical occurrence. In the nineteenth century American slaveholders were finally legally coerced into doing what they were already morally required to do: free their slaves. In many cases this led to the slave owners' financial and social ruin: they lost their farms, their money, and their power. Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations. Not only does this appear to be blatantly inconsistent, but even if he could avoid this inconsistency, there appears to be no principled way in which he can justify only his theory's non-consensual limitations on freedom..
    - Evidence 2: Libertarians often argue that a free market will naturally lead to economic prosperity for all, but many critics argue that this trickle-down theory is based on flawed assumptions and has not been supported by empirical evidence. For example, a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past few decades, despite the rise of neoliberal policies that promote free markets and limited government intervention..
    - Evidence 3: Libertarians often argue that individual freedom and property rights should be the primary values of society, but many critics argue that this emphasis on individualism ignores the importance of social cooperation and can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, philosopher Michael Walzer argues that individual freedom must be balanced against social equality and the common good..
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians often argue that market-based solutions are the most efficient and just way to address social problems, but many critics argue that markets can fail to address important social needs and can result in unequal outcomes. For example, economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that market failures, such as information asymmetries and externalities, can result in unequal outcomes and require government intervention to address..

    - Evidence 3: Environmentalists on the left who support regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as cap and trade, argue that many libertarians currently have no method of dealing with problems like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion because of their rejection of regulation and collective control..

Critics also accuse right-libertarians of ignoring market failures that could justify government intervention and result in monopolies, stifled innovation, or economic instability. Adam Smith's concept of natural liberty, an important tenet of libertarianism, is challenged as being a network of restraints not of liberty.

Claim 2: Libertarianism harms minorities or those who are worse off.

Supporting evidence: Critics point out that certain libertarian ideologies, such as those put forth by Robert Nozick, can lead to unfair societal structures, potentially endorsing exploitative practices such as consensual enslavement contracts. Additionally, philosopher James P. Sterba suggests that libertarian principles may, paradoxically, require equal distribution of resources and goods as upheld by a socialist state to ensure negative liberty rights for the poor.

Claim 3: Libertarianism is unjust/non-equal.

Supporting evidence: Critics question the libertarian stance that freedom should not be limited without consent, arguing that historical circumstances (like the abolition of slavery) have required non-consensual limitation of certain freedoms. Additionally, critics challenge the libertarian belief that free markets lead to universal prosperity, citing empirical evidence such as the OECD report on growing income inequality in neoliberal societies.

Claim 4: Libertarianism removes essential laws, infrastructure, and government services.

Supporting evidence: Critics note that libertarianism can lead to the legalization of potentially harmful activities, citing examples such as drug and alcohol use, gun ownership, and prostitution. The stance against regulations in libertarianism may also contribute to environmental problems, with critics pointing out that the philosophy lacks methods to address issues like environmental degradation and natural resource depletion.

Claim 5: The government is essential to protect the rights of citizens.

Supporting evidence: Critics highlight the crucial role of government in safeguarding fundamental human rights, such as freedom of speech and religion. A report by Human Rights Watch underscores the need for government protection of rights, particularly for vulnerable groups. Furthermore, the government's role in addressing environmental issues is vital, as evidenced by reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change urging governmental action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change."

For example, economist Milton Friedman argues that competition and innovation are key factors in promoting economic growth and development.
    - Evidence 4: Libertarians also argue that protection of property rights is essential for ensuring individual freedom. By guaranteeing individuals the right to own and control property, libertarians believe that individuals are better able to make decisions about how to use their resources and pursue their own goals. For example, economist James Buchanan argues that property rights are fundamental to a just and free society.
    - Evidence 5: Libertarians also argue that freedom of speech and expression are crucial for protecting individual freedom.

","Debate Summary:

Topic: ""We Should Adopt Libertarianism""

Argument for Economic Growth:
Proponents of libertarianism argue that it fosters economic growth by endorsing minimal government intervention, as noted by organizations like Americans for Limited Government. They cite that reduced taxation and free-market roads increase financial freedom and economic prosperity, leading to efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This view is supported by Kenyan libertarian economist James Shikwati, who champions freedom of trade as a panacea to poverty in Africa. Another supporting evidence is the theory presented in the book ""Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution"" by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins, which suggests a blend of libertarianism and green politics could produce both economic and environmental benefits.

Argument for Freedom in the Political System:
Libertarianism is seen to bolster freedom in the political system. Advocates argue that reduced government intervention leads to increased individual freedom. They highlight that countries with lower levels of government interference tend to have higher levels of individual freedom and economic growth, as supported by studies from the Cato Institute. Furthermore, libertarians maintain that a focus on individual freedom and property rights allows individuals to better pursue their goals, a view endorsed by philosopher Robert Nozick. Libertarian economist Milton Friedman also argues that a free environment fuels innovation, efficiency, and prosperity.

Argument for Happiness/Fulfilment:
The third argument is that libertarianism increases happiness and fulfilment. Advocates believe that granting individuals the freedom to make personal decisions enables them to pursue interests and goals, leading to fulfilment and happiness, as psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi posits. Property rights, as championed by economist F.A. Hayek, are viewed as fundamental to allowing individuals to act freely and pursue their interests. This freedom is believed to promote efficiency, innovation, and prosperity, as argued by economist Adam Smith.

Argument for Individual Liberties:
Lastly, the claim is made that libertarianism promotes individual liberties. Libertarians believe that individuals should be free from coercion unless directly engaged in aggression against rights. The military draft, for example, is viewed by libertarians within the YAF as a violation of individual freedom. This principle of self-ownership is staunchly defended by Rothbard, who dismisses alternatives on the grounds that they cannot result in a universal ethic. The perspective that people should generally be free to do as they wish is echoed by Sunstein and Thaler. The freedom to opt-out of undesirable arrangements is seen as a critical component of libertarianism, which supports maximum liberty in both personal and economic matters."
We should ban human cloning,-1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning can be used for organ replication.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: According to the World Health Organization, there is a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, and many people die while waiting for a suitable organ to become available..
    - Evidence 2: Another argument is that cloning can be used to create customized organs that are specific to an individual's needs. This can help to reduce the risk of rejection and improve the success rate of transplantation. For example, a study by the American Journal of Transplantation found that personalized transplantation could have a significant impact on the success of transplantation..
    - Evidence 3: Cloning can also be used to improve the quality of life for people with certain medical conditions. For example, cloning can be used to create replacement tissues for people with conditions like Parkinson's disease, which can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. A study by the Journal of Clinical Investigation found that transplantation of human stem cells can help to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease..
    - Evidence 4: Cloning can also help to reduce the use of animal testing in medical research.

","The topic of debate is whether 'we should ban human cloning'. The opponents of the ban put forth the following arguments:

Cloning can be used for organ replication.
The World Health Organization has noted a critical shortage of organs available for transplantation, with many people dying while waiting. Cloning could potentially address this problem by enabling the creation of customized organs, thereby reducing the risk of rejection and improving the success rate of transplantation, as per a study by the American Journal of Transplantation. In addition, research from the Journal of Clinical Investigation indicates that cloning could create replacement tissues for diseases like Parkinson's, slowing disease progression and improving patient quality of life.

Cloning helps those who cannot otherwise have a child.
Another argument against banning human cloning relates to infertility. The World Health Organization reports that about 10% of couples of reproductive age worldwide are affected by infertility. As such, cloning could potentially aid these couples by allowing them to have a child genetically related to one of the parents, according to studies in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics and the Journal of Medical Ethics. Furthermore, the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that cloning could even help to reduce the transmission of genetic diseases.

Cloning promotes health.
Cloning also has potential health benefits. A study in the Lancet journal suggests that cloning specific organs could replace damaged or diseased organs. Further, studies in Nature Genetics and Nature journals respectively suggest that cloning could help develop gene therapies for various diseases and significantly advance stem cell research. Moreover, cloning could potentially slow or reverse the aging process, as reported by the Aging Cell journal.

Cloning promotes science/research.
Lastly, opponents argue that cloning would advance scientific research. For instance, a study in the Journal of Medical Ethics suggests cloning could help us better understand embryo development. Moreover, according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, cloning could improve biomedical research. Other research, such as that in the Nature Biotechnology journal, argues cloning could advance biotechnology by producing genetically modified organisms for various applications. Additionally, cloning could shed light on the processes leading to species extinction, contributing to our understanding of evolution, according to a study in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology."
We should ban human cloning,1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should ban human cloning', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Cloning is not understood enough yet.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled The Wisdom of Repugnance, Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. In crucial cases, he writes, repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it. Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound.
    - Evidence 2: In the extreme, this could lead to the manufacturing and enslavement of monsters such as human clones, human-animal chimeras, or bioroids, but even lesser dislocations of humans and non-humans from social and ecological systems are seen as problematic..
    - Evidence 3: A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Cloning is unethical/anti-religious.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: On December 13, 2001, the United Nations General Assembly began elaborating an international convention against the reproductive cloning of humans. A broad coalition of States, including Spain, Italy, the Philippines, the United States, Costa Rica and the Holy See sought to extend the debate to ban all forms of human cloning, noting that, in their view, therapeutic human cloning violates human dignity..
    - Evidence 2: The Ministry of Health enacted the Danish Council Act 1988, which established the Danish Council of Ethics. The Council advises the Ministry on matters of medicine and genetic research on humans. In 2001, the Council condemned reproductive cloning because it would violate human dignity, because it could have adverse consequences for the cloned person and because permitting research on reproductive cloning would reflect a disregard for the respect due to the moral status of embryos..
    - Evidence 3: Article 11 of UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights asserts that the reproductive cloning of human beings is contrary to human dignity..
    - Evidence 4: Hwang himself criticised the process, stating that it did not bring science any closer to human cloning and the complexities, coupled with the low success rate (one in 123), did not make it ethical to clone family pets..
    - Evidence 5: In 2001, when Germany and France proposed at the United Nations General Assembly the adoption of an international convention to ban reproductive human cloning, the Holy See, together with a coalition of like-minded states that included Spain, Philippines, the United States, and Costa Rica, noted that such a convention would implicitly legitimize the cloning of human beings for research purposes, which is more serious from an ethical point of view than the reproductive one, and proposed banning all forms of human cloning..
- claim_3: Cloning is unnatural.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Much of the concern related to human cloning stems from a fear of overstepping the bounds of the natural order..
    - Evidence 2: Rev. Demetri Demopulos, Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist: As an Orthodox Christian, I speak out in opposition to any attempt to clone a human being because humans are supposed to be created by acts of love between two people, not through the manipulation of cells in acts that are ultimately about self-love.
    - Evidence 3: The Christian Coalition of America urged a human cloning ban and saw the alleged clone baby as an aberration..
    - Evidence 4: According to Richard McCormick, S.J., cloning disrupts the familial order. It would involve removing insemination and fertilization from the marriage relationship, and it would also remove one of the partners from the entire process..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Cloning is unsafe.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: FDA biotechnology chief Dr. Phil Noguchi warned that the human cloning, even if it worked, risked transferring sexually transmitted diseases to the newly born child..
    - Evidence 2: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2003 reported a low success rate for cloning animals, with many cloned animals suffering from health problems, genetic abnormalities, and premature death..
    - Evidence 3: A study published in the journal Nature Biotechnology in 2005 found that cloning can result in genetic mutations that may cause long-term health problems and reduced lifespan..
    - Evidence 4: A study published in the journal Nature Reviews Genetics in 2008 reported that cloning may result in unintended epigenetic changes that can have unpredictable consequences for the health of the cloned organism..
    - Evidence 5: A report published by the Council of Europe in 2008 discussed the potential for abuse of cloning technology and recommended measures to ensure that cloning is used for medical purposes only..
","The debate topic at hand is ""We should ban human cloning."" Supporters of this proposition present several compelling arguments, summarized as follows:

Claim 1: Cloning is not adequately understood yet. To support this, they point to a 1997 article by Leon Kass in The New Republic, in which he advocates for acknowledging the innate repugnance many people feel toward human cloning. Kass argues that such repugnance could be an expression of profound wisdom that cautions against the potential consequences of human willfulness, such as creating monstrous entities like human clones and chimeras, or the transformation of procreation into a mere manufacturing process.

Claim 2: Cloning is unethical and against religious beliefs. Evidence includes a range of international reactions against cloning. In 2001, the United Nations General Assembly began drafting an international convention against reproductive cloning of humans, reflecting global opposition. The Danish Council of Ethics also condemned reproductive cloning as a violation of human dignity, reflecting national perspectives. Furthermore, UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights explicitly labels the reproductive cloning of humans as contrary to human dignity.

Claim 3: Cloning is unnatural. Critics argue that it transgresses the natural order of things. This is encapsulated by Rev. Demetri Demopulos, a Greek Orthodox pastor and geneticist, who contends that humans should be created through acts of love, not through cellular manipulation. The Christian Coalition of America has also called human cloning an aberration, while Richard McCormick, S.J., posits that cloning disrupts the familial order by removing the act of procreation from the marital context.

Claim 4: Cloning is unsafe. This stance is backed by extensive scientific research. For instance, the FDA's Dr. Phil Noguchi warned about potential transmission of sexually transmitted diseases during the cloning process. Various studies in Nature Reviews Genetics and Nature Biotechnology have reported the low success rates in cloning animals, frequent genetic abnormalities, health problems, premature death, and unexpected genetic mutations, underscoring the potential risks and unpredictability of human cloning.

Taken together, these arguments emphasize the deep social, ethical, and safety concerns associated with human cloning, providing a multi-faceted rationale for advocating its ban."

","The opponents of the proposition ""We should ban private military companies"" forward four key claims:

Private military companies are financially beneficial. The Congressional Research Service report of 2009 underscores that their use can lead to cost savings for the government versus employing traditional military personnel. This is further supported by a 2011 study in Defense and Security Analysis, which found these companies' services to be more efficient due to their swift adaptability to changing circumstances. Similarly, a 2010 Heritage Foundation report emphasized their ability to provide specialized skills, expertise, and flexibility in hiring and deployment.

Private military companies are well-trained and better equipped. This is supported by the Heritage Foundation's 2010 report, which found that these companies' personnel often have higher training and experience levels than traditional military personnel. Additionally, the RAND Corporation's 2013 report confirms that such companies frequently invest in advanced technology, giving them an edge in effectiveness.

Private military companies can supplement regular armies in specific tasks. This view is backed by the Heritage Foundation's 2010 report, which mentions these companies' role in providing support services such as logistics and communications, thereby freeing regular army personnel for other tasks. The Congressional Research Service report of 2009 also noted their ability to provide security in hostile environments, allowing armies to concentrate on different tasks.

Private military companies increase safety. The Heritage Foundation's 2010 report found that these companies' efficient use of resources reduces overall military operation costs, thereby permitting a greater focus on safety. Their investment in advanced technology, as stated in the RAND Corporation's 2013 report, enables them to operate with enhanced safety and effectiveness. They also take on sensitive missions like covert operations, decreasing the risk to regular army personnel as per the 2007 Senate Armed Services Committee report."

","The debate topic is ""We should ban private military companies."" The proponents argue the following points, supported by credible evidence:

Private military companies are less ethical and violate rights or commit crimes: They cite reports from the Project on Government Oversight (2008), Amnesty International (2009), Congressional Research Service (2010), and the United Nations (2004) documenting criminal activities, human rights violations, unlawful killings, and usage of child soldiers by private military companies. A study published in the Journal of Business Ethics (2008) further highlights potential conflicts of interest that could lead to ethical violations.

Private military companies are not professional: This claim is supported by evidence from Human Rights Watch (2006), Amnesty International (2009), International Affairs (2010), and the Congressional Research Service (2009) that show these companies often operate with limited accountability and transparency, violate international laws, employ poorly trained personnel, and have unclear command chains, all contributing to decreased professionalism.

Private military companies cannot be trusted to be loyal to the hiring country: Reports from the Congressional Research Service (2012), Journal of Military Ethics (2009), Project on Government Oversight (2008), and Human Rights Watch (2007) argue that private military companies can prioritize their clients' interests over the interests of the hiring country, potentially causing a conflict of interest and diminishing trust.

Private military companies' main interest is profit: According to Human Rights Watch (2006), International Affairs (2010), Amnesty International (2009), Project on Government Oversight (2008), and the International Peace Institute (2006), these companies prioritize profit over ethical, legal, and societal considerations, driven by limited accountability and a largely unregulated industry.

Private military companies solicit engaging, or prolonging, conflict: Reports from the Project on Government Oversight (2008), International Peace Institute (2006), International Affairs (2010), Amnesty International (2009), and the Congressional Research Service (2009) suggest that these companies have a financial incentive to prolong conflicts and can escalate militarization, thereby aggravating the situation.

In conclusion, supporters of the ban on private military companies argue that such companies frequently engage in unethical behavior and crimes, lack professionalism, show potential disloyalty to hiring countries, prioritize profit, and have incentives to prolong conflicts. They back these claims with multiple pieces of evidence from well-respected organizations and academic journals."

","Debate Summary:

Opposition Stance: ""We should not ban the use of child actors""

Acting may be the child's dream. This is supported by a study from the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2014, which found that parents significantly influence their children's career aspirations, including acting. Moreover, the American Psychological Association in 2010 found that acting can be a meaningful outlet for children's emotions and contribute to their desire for a performing arts career.
Child performers gain confidence and achieve success, as evidenced by child artists like Ashwin Chitale who won the best child artist award.
Child performers are necessary for certain roles. For instance, the Screen Actors Guild in 2006 found some roles could only be filled by children. Additionally, the Journal of Dramatic Theory and Criticism in 2016 found that child casting can be crucial for character development and narrative themes.
Child actors should not be banned as long as there is adequate supervision and regulation. One illustration is the entertainment industry's practice of securing work permits for child actors, ensuring legal protection and compliance with labor laws.
Parents should decide for their children. Research such as the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology's 2012 study suggests that parents are best equipped to make decisions on behalf of their children due to their deep understanding of their children's needs and abilities."

","Debate Summary:

Positive Stance: ""We should ban the use of child actors""

Performing can harm the child's education. The American Academy of Pediatrics in 2009 found that young performers may experience developmental delays and emotional difficulties, leading to long-term adverse effects.
Child performers are at risk of exploitation. The Journal of Adolescence in 2012 reported that child performers often face labor violations like wage theft and poor working conditions. Furthermore, the Journal of Pediatrics in 2013 suggested the risk of sexual exploitation.
Child performers are losing their childhood. According to the Journal of Adolescence in 2012, these children often lose out on free time and childhood experiences due to rigorous work and rehearsal schedules.
Child performers face immense pressure. The American Psychological Association in 2017 reported high levels of stress among child actors, leading to negative impacts on mental health.
Child performers tend to develop problems later in life. Many instances show troubled adult lives due to the stressful environment child actors are exposed to. For example, Anissa Jones and Jonathan Brandis, once child stars, had severe personal struggles leading to tragic ends."

- claim_1: Closing the Guantanamo bay detention camp would harm national security.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are currently 80 detainees remaining in Guantanamo Bay. The remaining detainee population is generally composed of hardened and unrepentant terrorist. The transfer of any of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to another country risks harming America's national security, and we cannot be certain that a particular detainee will return to terrorism..
    - Evidence 2: As reported by the director of the National Intelligence in March of this year, approximately 17.5 percent of former Gitmo detainees that have been transferred to other countries are confirmed of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.  That is 118 out of 676 former detainees who are directly involved in terrorism or insurgency since the first Guantanamo transfers in 2002. This includes 111 detainees transferred during the Bush administration and seven detainees transferred during the Obama administration. An estimated 12.7 percent of  all former Guantanamo detainees, 86 altogether, are suspected of reengaging in terrorist or insurgent activities..
    - Evidence 3: High-Value Enemy Combatant Defined.--In this section, the term  ``high-value enemy combatant'' means an enemy combatant who--(1) is a senior member of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group; (2) has knowledge of an imminent terrorist threat against the United States or its territories, the Armed Forces of the United States, the people or organizations of the United States, or an ally of the United States;  (3) has, or has had, direct involvement in planning or preparing a terrorist action against the United States or an ally of the United States or in assisting the leadership of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group in  planning or preparing such a terrorist action; or (4) if released from detention, would constitute a clear and continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the United States..

    - Evidence 2: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is a secure location away from population centers, provides maximum security required to prevent escape, provides multiple levels of confinement opportunities based on the compliance of detainees, and provides medical care not available for a majority of the population of the world..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Guantanamo Bay was chosen as the best place for long-term detention for a host of legal operational and logistics reasons, that there was much more viable strategic consideration. It was designed to be an intelligence center for excellence in the war on terror. If the U.S. can get terrorists off the battlefield and into Guantanamo Bay, we can be presented with an unprecedented opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Al Qaeda recruits, trains, equips, finances, and conducts these operations..
    - Evidence 2: We will continue to bring the world’s most dangerous terrorists to justice—and we will continue working to collect the vital intelligence we need to protect our country.  The current transfers mean that there are now no terrorists in the CIA program.  But as more high-ranking terrorists are captured, the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical—and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life-saving information.
    - Evidence 3: “The president has been really explicit ... that Gitmo is a very, very important tool,” Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, said on Fox News this morning. It's also important to understand that Guantanamo Bay is an incredibly important intelligence asset..
    - Evidence 4: The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single  greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on terror..
    - Evidence 5: Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees . . .' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced interrogation techniques against some of those detainees'..
","Debate Summary:

Topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp'

Arguments Against Closing Guantanamo Bay:
Claim_1: Closing Guantanamo Bay would harm national security.

Evidence: It's argued that the remaining detainees are hardened terrorists whose transfer could harm U.S. national security (Evidence 1). Additionally, it is claimed that 17.5% of former detainees reengaged in terrorism or insurgency upon release (Evidence 2).
Claim_2: Guantanamo Bay is better for prisoners than the alternatives.

Evidence: Proponents of this claim point to the humane treatment, compliance with the Geneva Convention, and excellent medical care provided at Guantanamo Bay that surpasses maximum-security prisons worldwide (Evidence 1 & 2).
Claim_3: Guantanamo Bay is essential to gain intelligence.

Evidence: It's argued that Guantanamo Bay was strategically chosen as an intelligence center to understand terrorist operations better and collect critical life-saving information (Evidence 1 & 2)."
We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp,1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should close Guantanamo Bay detention camp', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Detainees have the right to trial in US courts.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: On Thursday, June 12, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the case of Boumediene v. Bush [553 U.S. 723 (2008)] that detainees held at Guantánamo Bay have the rights to challenge their detention in U.S. civilian courts under the Constitution’s habeas corpus provision and to have access to a lawyer..
    - Evidence 2: Finding the federal habeas statute thus applied extraterritorially and was not dependent upon U.S. citizenship, Stevens concluded that detainees at Guantanamo were entitled to invoke the federal courts’ authority under § 2241..
    - Evidence 3: In a stinging defeat for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled today that detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have a constitutional right to challenge their detentions in federal court and that congressional legislation has failed to provide a reasonable substitute for such a hearing..
    - Evidence 4: The US supreme court has ruled that prisoners seized as potential terrorists and held for more than two years in Guantánamo bay may challenge their captivity in US courts..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: The Guantanamo bay detention camp harms the US image/reputation/institutions.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Every branch of our government shares responsibility for Guantánamo’s ongoing damage to the human rights of detainees, our nation’s reputation, and national security. The president and his agencies have the power to end indefinite detention and close Guantánamo, ending this travesty rather than perpetuating it. However, the Trump administration has pledged to keep Guantánamo open, ignoring that it has been a catastrophic failure on every front..
    - Evidence 2: Guantanamo remains a blot on the reputation of the United States as a nation dedicated to the rule of law, and it has undoubtedly served as a recruiting tool for terrorists..
    - Evidence 3: After twenty years of operation, the Guantanamo experiment long ago tarnished the United States’ reputation as a global leader on human rights, said Michael Breen, President and CEP of Human Rights First. Moreover, the military commission and detention systems at Guantanamo harm national security by undermining efforts to cooperate with allies on global counterterrorism campaigns and feeding into the propaganda and recruitment efforts of terrorist groups. Guantanamo has proven itself to be a costly moral and strategic failure; after two disastrous and detrimental decades, it must finally be closed..
    - Evidence 4: Guantanamo has harmed the fight against terrorism. It has undermined international cooperation and alienated Muslim communities. And fourth, the moral authority of the United States has been severely compromised by Guantanamo's existence, with disastrous results for the U.S. government's ability to promote human rights abroad..
    - Evidence 5: The facilities at Guantánamo have become emblematic of the gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the US government in the name of terrorism..
- claim_3: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is a symbol of discrimination/injustice.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Originally intended to be an “island outside the law” where terrorism suspects could be detained without process and interrogated without restraint, the prison and military commissions at Guantánamo Bay are catastrophic failures. At home and around the world, Guantánamo has become a symbol of injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law..
    - Evidence 2: Around the world, Guantánamo is a symbol of racial and religious injustice, abuse, and disregard for the rule of law. Our government’s embrace of systematic torture shattered lives, shredded this country’s reputation in the world, and compromised national security. To this day, it has refused to release the full details of the torture program or to provide justice and redress for all the many victims..
    - Evidence 3: Guantánamo Bay has become a world-wide symbol of injustice and oppression which has tarnished America’s international reputation and has served as a recruitment tool for future insurgents..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: The Guantanamo bay detention camp is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The U.S. military court and prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, have cost more than $6 billion to operate since opening nearly 18 years ago and still churn through more than $380 million a year despite housing only 40 prisoners today..
    - Evidence 2: In 2013, it cost about $2.7 million per prisoner (which is, admittedly, still a lot!), up from an estimate of $800,000 per prisoner in 2011. Factor in the age of some of the prisoners still there and the medical care they'll eventually need, and it's easy to see the $13 million figure going even higher..
    - Evidence 3: Since Congress decided to pursue austerity in 2011, it has chosen to spend at least $1.42 billion on the mission at Guantanamo, although it could have been accomplished for just $29.9 million..
    - Evidence 4: Simply by transferring the 84 detainees already cleared to leave Guantanamo, the United States could save nearly $2 billion over the next 10 years..
    - Evidence 5: As reporter Carole Rosenberg wrote in The New York Times on Monday, the total cost in 2018 for housing just 40 prisoners, paying the guards, and running the military tribunals there is morwe than $540 million, or roughly $13 million per prisoner..
- claim_5: The Guantanamo bay detention camp personnel commit crimes against the prisoners.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: By 2004, a full scale inspection was underway to investigate charges of abuse and torture of the prisoners.  Guards were accused of several crimes such as sexual humiliation, water boarding and the use of vicious dogs to threaten detainees.  People from all over the world called for the site to be closed down, but American government officials denied that the prisoners were being tortured..
    - Evidence 2: detainees at Guantanamo have been arbitrarily detained, physically abused, and even tortured. They have spent years without any fair legal process, held on the basis of secret evidence..
    - Evidence 3: nan.
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_6: unjust treatment/tactics are used in the Guantanamo bay detention camp.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: 779 men have been taken to the facility since then. Of these, only seven have been convicted, including five as a result of pre-trial agreements under which they pleaded guilty in return for the possibility of release from the base. These men faced trial by 'military commission'. The proceedings did not meet fair trial standards..
    - Evidence 2: The CSRT applies a broad definition of enemy combatant that inevitably ensnares innocent people;  applies a presumption of guilt;  has no juries; disables prisoners from gathering exculpatory evidence;  prohibits prisoners from having lawyers;   and relies on hearsay, coerced confessions, and secret evidence to reach its judgment that a prisoner should be detained indefinitely..
    - Evidence 3: A government report describes the facility as having been “modified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,” with doors that had been “sealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.” Inside, the walls were “covered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.” There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound..
    - Evidence 4: Mr. Slahi endured some of the most brutal treatment there. Investigations by the Army, the Justice Department and the Senate largely corroborated his account of being deprived of sleep; beaten; shackled in painful positions; forced to drink large amounts of water; isolated in darkness and exposed to extreme temperatures; stripped and soaked in cold water; told that his mother might be sent to Guantánamo; and sexually assaulted by female interrogators..
    - Evidence 5: Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld later approved interrogation techniques in Guantánamo that included sleep deprivation, stress positions, nudity, sensory deprivation and threatening detainees with dogs..

    - Evidence 2: An opinion column in the Houston Chronicle after a similar sale took place at Texas A&M University held that 'Actions like these reinforce the common misconception that affirmative action policies give academically unqualified minority students a get-into-college-free card, and they ignore historical discrimination that denied nonwhites opportunities to be successful at any price, no matter their talents or intelligence.'.
    - Evidence 3: Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals..
    - Evidence 4: The justification for affirmative action is that it helps to compensate for past discrimination, persecution or exploitation by the ruling class of a culture,[REF] and to address existing discrimination [REF]..
    - Evidence 5: As historian Roger Wilkins has pointed out, Blacks have a 375-year history on this continent: 245 involving slavery, 100 involving legalized discrimination, and only 30 involving anything else (Wilkins, 1995). Jews and Asians, on the other hand, have immigrated to North America—often as doctors, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs, and so forth. Moreover, European Jews are able to function as part of the White majority. To expect Blacks to show the same upward mobility as Jews and Asians is to deny the historical and social reality that Black people face..

","Debate Summary:

The debate focuses on the proposition, 'We should end affirmative action.' The opposition and supporting arguments are presented in the given material.

Opponents argue the following:

Affirmative action boosts diversity: They cite evidence of universities such as UC admitting more minority students, data showing that ending affirmative action could reduce the number of black lawyers by 12.7%, and court cases like Grutter v Bollinger and Fisher v. University of Texas that uphold the importance of diversity and affirmative action in education.

Affirmative action is necessary to compensate for the past: Pointing to historical factors like slavery and legalized discrimination, opponents argue that affirmative action helps counteract these long-standing effects. One compelling argument cites the significantly different histories faced by Blacks compared to other immigrant groups in America, thus justifying the need for affirmative action.

Affirmative action reduces discrimination: The evidence highlights how affirmative action bridges inequalities, increases access to education, and redresses past wrongs. They refer to cases such as Johnson v. Transportation Agency, which upheld affirmative action plans to correct 'manifest imbalance' in traditionally segregated job categories."

    - Evidence 4: Almost 70% of white students graduate from higher education, compared to about 50% of Black and Latine students. This shows affirmative action isn't completely doing its job.

","Debate Summary:

The debate focuses on the proposition, 'We should end affirmative action.' The opposition and supporting arguments are presented in the given material.

On the other hand, the proponents of ending affirmative action put forth these arguments:

Affirmative action diminishes the achievements of minorities: They suggest that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of the intended beneficiaries, implying it's counterproductive. This argument is amplified by cases like Students for Fair Admissions Inc. suing Harvard University for allegedly capping Asian-American admissions.

Affirmative action is ineffective: They argue that affirmative action may inadvertently leave less-skilled, less-educated African Americans behind, and mention Arizona's constitutional ban on government-sponsored affirmative action as an example.

Affirmative action is not just: Proponents of ending affirmative action view it as a shallow solution to deep-seated educational system issues. They further argue it focuses more on superficial diversity than on ensuring equal opportunities for marginalized communities.

Affirmative action perpetuates prejudice: The claim here is that affirmative action leads to 'reverse discrimination.' The Swedish Supreme Court ruling that 'affirmative action' ethnic quotas in universities are discrimination and unlawful is presented as evidence.

Affirmative action reduces quality: Proponents argue that affirmative action may lower the quality of higher education, citing lower graduation rates for BIPOC students and varying mean SAT scores and high-school GPAs among different racial groups at the University of Texas."

","Summary of the Supporters' Argument on Ending Mandatory Retirement

Supporters of ending mandatory retirement propose that it:

Decreases institutional knowledge, with the lack of a mandatory retirement age for certain professions in the UK and US serving as evidence. They reference the practices of successful businessmen who opposed mandatory retirement and preserved institutional knowledge.

Harms the economy, substantiated by several studies from institutions like the OECD, ILO, and IMF. These studies argue that mandatory retirement decreases labor force participation, leads to an inefficient use of human capital, impedes workforce diversity, and slows economic growth.

Is discriminatory, with studies from organizations such as the AARP, ILO, and NBER cited. These studies suggest that mandatory retirement results in age discrimination, disregards individual circumstances, limits older workers' earning potential, and decreases older workers' sense of purpose.

Reduces the quality of life for those forced to retire, supported by several academic publications. These works found that mandatory retirement can lead to health decline, decreased psychological well-being, decreased physical and cognitive function, decreased spending, and decreased social connections.

Should allow everyone to retire when they are ready. Studies from WHO, NBER, ILO, AARP, and WEF are given as evidence, arguing that voluntary retirement promotes well-being, financial security, intergenerational collaboration, active aging, and reduces poverty in old age."

","Debate Summary:

Topic 1: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons'

Opposing Stance:

Claim 1: Nuclear weapons are essential for protection and deterrence.

Evidence: A prominent piece of evidence supporting this claim is the strategy of deterrence which has been instrumental in maintaining peace for nearly 70 years. The conflict in Ukraine also serves as an example, showing that countries not protected by a nuclear umbrella, such as Ukraine, are vulnerable, while those that are, like NATO and Russia, avoid major military confrontations."
We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons,1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: There are 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material that is highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium, said Deepti Choubey, senior director of nuclear and bio-security at the Nuclear Threat Initiative in Washington. These are the materials that a terrorist would use to make a kind of bomb that you would use for nuclear terrorism attacks and they are currently spread across hundreds of sites in 25 countries around the world..
    - Evidence 2: Cause for concern, said Jonathan Herbach, a research fellow in nuclear security and arms control law at Utrecht University in The Netherlands, was the theft or loss of nuclear materials, some of which were sometimes never recovered. “These materials aren’t going away and more states are interested in developing them,” said Mr Herbach..
    - Evidence 3: Recent propaganda from Isis has claimed that they could obtain nuclear weapons within the year. Even if this is the “sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies”, history has shown that reducing the threat of nuclear warfare, or working to prevent nuclear weapons falling into the “wrong hands”, has never been the top priority..
    - Evidence 4: Accidents and errors are of course not the only possible path that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. There is the risk of a terribly irresponsible person leading a country possessing nuclear weapons. There is the risk of nuclear terrorism, possibly after a terrorist organization steals weapons. There is the possibility that hackers can take control of the nuclear chain of command. And there is the possibility that several of these factors play a role at the same time..
    - Evidence 5: Ariel Conn: Richard Nixon's depression is the scariest to me because that's something that could happen at any time to any president. It's not dependent on external conflicts with other countries, but internal, personal conflicts that the rest of the world may or may not know about. As mental health becomes a more recognized issue, it's increasingly apparent that no one can really be trusted with nuclear weapons..
- claim_2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: If there had been a Soviet nuclear attack at that time, the U.S. would have sent more than 3,200 nuclear weapons to 1,060 targets in the Soviet Union, China, and other communist countries in Asia and Europe, Hunter said. The Pentagon estimated that there would have been 275 million deaths in Russia and China, with 50 million more dead in another six months—roughly half the populations of both countries at the time. Another 100 million would have died in Eastern European satellite countries, and 100 million more would have died in Western Europe due to radioactive fallout and Russian short-range missiles that survived the initial attack..
    - Evidence 2: More than 91 million people in Russia, the US, and other NATO countries might be killed or injured within three hours following a single nuclear warning shot, according to a terrifying simulation..
    - Evidence 3: Max Tegmark: Soviet Sub Captain Decides to Fire Nuclear Torpedo During Cuban Missile Crisis To me, this is both harrowing and educational: it shows how great risk can come from the combination of many separate unfortunate coincidences and misunderstandings that couldn’t start a nuclear war on their own, but can provide the perfect storm when combined. The fact that it remained secret for decades also suggests that there may be recent scary incidents that we haven’t yet heard of..
    - Evidence 4: David Stanley: Lost Contact with 50 Missiles To me this is the scariest because, unlike the other events, this could potentially have led to an accidental launch of ICBMs rather than just a false alarm of an incoming attack. Additionally, the fact that it happened so recently highlights that our present safeguards are not necessarily more robust than those from 50 years ago..
    - Evidence 5: Anthony Aguirre: Perhaps it’s breaking the rules, but I would say the constellation of incidents *around* (and including) the Cuban missile crisis — so many!  It suggests that (a) when tensions escalate, it becomes dramatically more probable that unfortunate coincidences etc. will conspire to create big problems (like “Soviet Sub Captain…Crisis”) and (b) we were *very* lucky to get through the Cuban Missile crisis, and we have no good reason to be confident that we would make it through any similar flare-up in tensions..
","Topic 1: 'We should fight for the abolition of nuclear weapons'

Supporting Stance:

Claim 1: Nuclear weapons can fall into the wrong hands.

Evidence: The assertion is backed by evidence like the existing 2,000 metric tonnes of weapons-usable nuclear material spread across 25 countries which could potentially be used for nuclear terrorism. Recent claims from terrorist groups like ISIS also highlight the imminent threat of nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands.
Claim 2: Nuclear weapons provoke or escalate a disastrous military action.

Evidence: The potentially catastrophic outcomes of nuclear warfare are illustrated by historical examples such as the Cold War's Cuban Missile Crisis, which narrowly avoided a nuclear catastrophe. Furthermore, simulations suggest over 91 million casualties within three hours in case of a nuclear attack."

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural activities largely contribute sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers..
    - Evidence 2: The problems facing the creeks are blamed on urbanization, which has deprived the creeks of needed sediment while increasing pollution..
    - Evidence 3: Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water..
    - Evidence 4: Surveys showed that urbanization and coastal development, especially from tourism and agricultural sectors, contributed to increased degradation of the marine environment in the area..

- claim_4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: The fast urbanization of Tagum from the late '80s to 1990 which was attributed to the mushrooming of business establishments and other commercial activities, increasing population and services and other factors, has caused various problems and needs, like roads, drainage, the increasing numbers of squatters, upscaling trend of traffic congestion in major streets, garbage and sanitation, land use and others..
    - Evidence 2: A recent study of 4.4 million men and women in Sweden found a 68%-77% increased risk of diagnosed psychosis for people living in the most urbanized environments, a significant proportion of which is likely to be described as schizophrenia..
    - Evidence 3: In the other hand, the city had a great commercial movement, and good-quality touristic services, so the fast process of urbanization, had the consequence of irregular neighbourhoods..
    - Evidence 4: The UNESCO report emphasized the negative effects of overurbanization, detailing low levels of living as inadequate housing, the almost complete absence of mass sanitary facilities, the presence of filth, squalor, repugnant odours, disease and high mortality and large urban groups who have little or no access to educational facilities..
    - Evidence 5: Some scholars suggest that urbanization creates slums because local governments are unable to manage urbanization, and migrant workers without an affordable place to live in, dwell in slums..
","Topic 2: 'We should fight urbanization'

Supporting Stance:

Claim 1: Restrictions on migration would benefit people in rural areas economically/socially.

Evidence: The economic decline and urbanization in Venezuela, leading to the country becoming a net food importer despite having fertile soil, highlight the adverse impact of urbanization on rural economies.
Claim 2: Urbanization causes crime.

Evidence: An increase in crime rates associated with urban migration and industrialization supports this claim, as seen in Maori communities and cities like Bopal & Ghuma.
Claim 3: Urbanization harms the environment.

Evidence: Urbanization has been linked to degradation of coastal waters, increase in pollution, and decreased access to clean water, illustrating its detrimental effects on the environment.
Claim 4: Urbanization is causing a strain on the cities' resources.

Evidence: Rapid urbanization is shown to lead to problems like housing shortages, sanitation issues, traffic congestion, and increased slum populations, as seen in Tagum and in a UNESCO report discussing overurbanization."

    - Evidence 1: Abstention from voting is a form of exercising one's right to vote. When someone confirms that they are abstaining from voting, it means they are voting neither for nor against the motion at hand. Nevertheless, they are still taking part in the elections, but have expressed neither approval nor disapproval for a particular candidate, party or motion..
    - Evidence 2: An abstention may be used to indicate the voting individual's ambivalence about the measure, or mild disapproval that does not rise to the level of active opposition. Abstention can also be used when someone has a certain position about an issue, but since the popular sentiment supports the opposite, it might not be politically expedient to vote according to their conscience.

    - Evidence 2: It is often asserted that uninformed voters are more susceptible to the influence of money and spending on television ads . A short advertisement is likely to have a greater influence on an uninformed voter than one who already has strong views. This encourages the use of sensational and misleading advertising and may have a negative effect on campaigning techniques. While politicians no longer need to try to convince citizens to go out and vote, they still need to find ways to maximize their vote among less informed voters. Australian political scientist, Haydon Manning notes that compulsory voting often require[s] banal sloganeering and crass misleading negative advertising ..
    - Evidence 3: Dampening the voice of the majority. An additional concern under a compulsory system is that people who are uninformed (or simply do not care about the outcome of an election) may end up voting randomly.

","Summary of Debate:

Topic: ""We should introduce compulsory voting""

Position of Opponents:

Claim: Abstaining from a vote is also reflecting your preferences.
Evidence: Abstention from voting is a form of expressing one's right to vote. It can show ambivalence, mild disapproval, or the lack of adequate information on the issue at hand. For instance, Herbert Spencer highlighted that whether a person votes or abstains, they are deemed to have consented to the rule of the winning candidate.

Claim: Citizens have a right not to vote.
Evidence: Compelling citizens to vote can be seen as a violation of freedom of speech, as freedom to speak includes the freedom not to speak. In the United States, this argument has found resonance among legal scholars. Additionally, it's suggested that compulsory voting could be a breach of civil liberties, leading to a slippery slope towards totalitarianism.

Claim: Compulsory voting can cause people to vote in an uninformed or random manner.
Evidence: Evidence from the Netherlands shows that the abolition of compulsory voting affected the voting patterns in favor of social democratic parties. Furthermore, compulsory voting may encourage misleading advertising and sensationalism, potentially influencing uninformed voters. Uninformed or indifferent voters could end up voting randomly, which may not accurately reflect public opinion.

Claim: Not everyone has the ability to go to vote.
Evidence: The American public, for instance, may lack basic information about the Constitution, leading to voting based on disinformation."

    - Evidence 2: A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda by up to 20 percentage points..
    - Evidence 3: Amber Herrle and E.J. Dionne, Jr. consider 50% turnout in midterm elections a historical achievement (as was the case in 2018) should be a warning. The disparities in turnout between different groups, detailed in their report, are equally worrying. Boosting turnout, they insist, is a matter of justice and representation..
    - Evidence 4: Compulsory voting means that candidates have to address the needs of all the voters. If voting were voluntary, the experience of countries like the United States is that poorer and less educated people would tend not to vote. This would skew the political system (further) toward the well off and well educated..

  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Since voting at referendums in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory has been allowed in 1977, compulsory voting has also applied there..
    - Evidence 2: Concerns about declining democratic engagement and participation have been raised by the Electoral Commission, and by commentators such as Geoffrey Palmer and Andrew Butler, leading some to support the introduction of compulsory voting, as exists in Australia..
    - Evidence 3: Compulsory registration and voting increase the legitimacy of elected representatives. Candidates winning seats in parliament really do win a majority of the people’s votes. In countries like the United States, where the turnout can be low, candidates can win with much less than a majority of the eligible vote..

    - Evidence 3: A counter argument to opponents of compulsory voting is that in these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot..
    - Evidence 4: Voter turnout during elections is not much of a problem in Thailand as voting is compulsory and is one of the responsibilities described in the Constitution a citizen must exercise..

","Summary of Debate:

Topic: ""We should introduce compulsory voting""

Position of Supporters:

Claim: Compulsory voting increases representation.
Evidence: Studies indicate that compulsory voting reduces the gender gap in electoral engagement. Additionally, research in a Swiss canton found that compulsory voting increased support for leftist policies in referenda. Compulsory voting also addresses the needs of all voters, reducing the risk of political bias towards more affluent and educated citizens.

Claim: Compulsory voting will cause more people to become interested in politics.
Evidence: Compulsory voting can increase democratic engagement and political legitimacy, as seen in territories like the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. In these regions, candidates have won with a majority of the people's votes due to compulsory voting, enhancing their legitimacy.

Claim: People have an obligation to vote.
Evidence: Compulsory voting does not violate fundamental freedoms, as it requires attendance at a polling station, not necessarily voting. In systems where voting is compulsory, individuals still have the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally. Voting is seen as one of the most important rights, as evidenced by struggles for voting rights in the US and other countries. Thus, not voting could be seen as taking this right for granted."

The study gave six of the twelve teenage rats a small dose of THC, reportedly equivalent to one joint smoked by a human, every three days. The rats were allowed to administer heroin by pushing a lever and the study found the rats given THC took larger doses of heroin. The institute examined the brain cells in the rats and found THC alters the opioid system that is associated with positive emotions, which lessens the effects of opiates on rat's brain and thus causes them to use more heroin..
    - Evidence 2: Multiple opponents of cannabis decriminalization have claimed increased cannabis use results in increased abuse of other illicit drugs..

","Debate Summary:

Opponents of the topic ""We should legalize cannabis"" argue that:

Cannabis harms the body. Evidence comes from Dutch research showing that increased THC content in cannabis heightens the occurrence of impaired psychomotor skills, particularly in younger or inexperienced smokers. Additionally, a 2008 study by the National Institutes of Health Biomedical Research Centre suggests that heavy marijuana smoking is linked to heart disease and stroke.

Cannabis increases lack-of-judgement/accidents. A 2012 meta-analysis, along with a study from the American Journal of Public Health, found that cannabis use increases the risk of automobile crashes.

Cannabis is a gateway drug. Studies, including one from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, have demonstrated that cannabis use can lead to the use of more dangerous illicit drugs, and that the chemical properties of cannabis might create addictive tendencies.

Legal cannabis can reach underage individuals. Data from a federally funded Monitoring the Future Survey indicates that the majority of high school seniors find marijuana easy to obtain, and legalisation may increase its accessibility further.

Legal cannabis will boost the black market. For instance, despite legalizing marijuana, California has faced several instances of illegal cannabis operations."
We should legalize cannabis,1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize cannabis', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful drugs yet remain legal.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: A 2002 DAWN report, for the USA records two possible drug-induced deaths where marijuana was the only drug found. Legal drugs however, have been the cause of more than half a million deaths a year: 480,000 from tobacco smoking-related illnesses and 80,000 from alcohol abuse [REF.
    - Evidence 2: In 2001, the New Mexico state-commissioned Drug Policy Advisory Group stated that decriminalizing cannabis will result in greater availability of resources to respond to more serious crimes without any increased risks to public safety..
    - Evidence 3: Psychopharmacologist David Nutt argues, though he is against full declassification, that the harm caused by cannabis is far less than that caused by alcohol or tobacco, which, if they were invented today would be illegal..
    - Evidence 4: Making marijuana legally available to adults on more or less the same terms as alcohol would tend to reduce crime, certainly by greatly shrinking the illicit market and possibly by reducing alcohol consumption via substitution if smoking marijuana acts, on balance, as a substitute for drinking alcohol rather than a complement to it since drinking seems to have a greater tendency to unleash aggression than does cannabis use..
    - Evidence 5: There is evidence that many illicit drugs pose comparatively fewer health dangers than certain legal drugs. The health risks of MDMA (Ecstasy) have been exaggerated for instance, the risks from cannabis use also overstated, and health problems from the use of legal substances, particularly alcohol and tobacco, are greater, even than from cocaine use for example (occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems)..
- claim_2: Cannabis is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Advocates of marijuana legalization argue that the budgetary impact of removing cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act and legalizing its use in the United States could save billions by reducing government spending for prohibition enforcement in the criminal justice system. Additionally, they argue that billions in annual tax revenues could be generated through proposed taxation and regulation..
    - Evidence 2: The party commissioned a report by the Independent Drug Monitoring Unit, published on 14 September 2011, stating that a taxed and regulated cannabis market would save the exchequer ¬£6.7 billion..
    - Evidence 3: In 1988, Michael Aldrich and Tod Mikuriya published Savings in California Marijuana Law Enforcement Costs Attributable to the Moscone Act of 1976 in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. The study estimated California saved almost one billion dollars in a twelve-year period between 1976 and 1988, as a result of the Moscone Act of 1976 that decriminalized cannabis..

  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: A study published in the March 1, 1990 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences stated that there are virtually no reports of fatal cannabis overdose in humans and attributed this safety to the low density of cannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain controlling breathing and the heart..
    - Evidence 2: Cannabis advocates pointed out that the IOM did not study vaporizers, devices which, by heating cannabis to 185 ¬∞C, release therapeutic cannabinoids while reducing or eliminating ingestion of various carcinogens..
    - Evidence 3: A group of congressmen led by Maurice Hinchey wrote a letter to FDA's commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach, expressing their disapproval of the FDA's statement and pointed out the FDA's rejection of medical cannabis was inconsistent with the findings of the Institute of Medicine, which stated cannabis does have medical benefits..

The BCS figures, published in October 2007, showed that the proportion of frequent users in the 16-24 age group (i.e. who were using cannabis more than once a month), fell from 12% to 8% in the past four years..
    - Evidence 2: In Hallucinations: Behavior, Experience, and Theory (1975), senior US government researchers Louis Jolyon West and Ronald K. Siegel explain how drug prohibition can be used for selective social control: .   The role of drugs in the exercise of political control is also coming under increasing discussion. Control can be through prohibition or supply. The total or even partial prohibition of drugs gives the government considerable leverage for other types of control. An example would be the selective application of drug laws .. against selected components of the population such as members of certain minority groups or political organizations..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: The Connecticut Law Revision Commission made the following evaluation: (1) the costs of arresting and prosecuting marijuana offenders were significantly lower in states that had done away with criminal penalties for possessing small amounts; (2) there was a greater increase in marijuana use in states that continue to treat possession as crime than in states that treated it as a civil offense; (3) easing the penalties for marijuana did not lead to a substantial increase in the use of either alcohol or hard drugs..
    - Evidence 2: The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many unintended negative consequences of drug enforcement..
    - Evidence 3: Supporters argued that legalizing marijuana in California would help alleviate the drug war in Mexico. Based on the theory espoused by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that up to 60% of Mexican drug cartels' profits come from sales of marijuana, legalizing the drug in nearby California would drastically cut their funding. As a result, supporters of this argument believed that legalization would lead to a decrease in drug-related violent crime in Mexico..
    - Evidence 4: The editor of the British Medical Journal, Dr. Fiona Godlee, gave her personal support to Rolles' call for decriminalisation, and the arguments drew particular support from Sir Ian Gilmore, former president of the Royal College of Physicians, who said we should be treating drugs as a health issue rather than criminalising people and this could drastically reduce crime and improve health..
    - Evidence 5: Some argued that legalization of marijuana could reduce drug-related violence, based on a study conducted by the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy. This study found that drug law enforcement contributes to increased levels of drug-related violence and suggests that alternative models for drug control may be necessary..
- claim_6: People should be allowed to do whatever they want to their own bodies.
  Evidence supporting claim_6:
    - Evidence 1: Such arguments often cite the harm principle of philosopher John Stuart Mill who urged that the state had no right to intervene to prevent individuals from doing something that harmed them, if no harm was thereby done to the rest of society: 'Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign' and 'The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.

","Supporters of ""We should legalize cannabis"" counter that:

Alcohol and tobacco are more harmful yet remain legal. They point out that legal substances like tobacco and alcohol are responsible for more than half a million deaths a year in the USA, which is vastly more than marijuana.

Legalizing cannabis is financially beneficial. The advocates point to potential savings from reduced enforcement of prohibition in the criminal justice system and increased tax revenues.

Cannabis can have positive health effects. Studies have found that fatal cannabis overdose is extremely rare, and cannabis does indeed have therapeutic properties.

Legalization would allow for regulation of cannabis. Statistics indicate that decriminalization of cannabis does not necessarily increase its use, but allows for better control and resources to combat more serious crimes.

Legalizing cannabis would reduce black market activity and associated criminality. Legalization could undercut illegal cannabis operations by providing a legal alternative.

Individuals should have autonomy over their own bodies. Invoking philosopher John Stuart Mill's harm principle, they argue that individuals should have the right to make choices about their own health and wellbeing as long as it doesn't harm others."

    - Evidence 2: One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution, with one study finding that encounters with prostitutes produced 84% of new HIV infections in adult males in Accra, Ghana. The spread of HIV from urban settings to rural areas in Africa has been attributed to the mobility of farmers who visit sex workers in cities, for example in Ethiopia..
    - Evidence 3: Registering prostitutes makes the state complicit in prostitution and does not address the health risks of unregistered prostitutes..

Schaapman had once been a prostitute and was getting information about the influx of organized crime and violence into the business. Other reports came out around the same time. They concluded that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work and were being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, and that the goals of legalization were failing..

","Topic: We should legalize prostitution

Opponent's Stance:

Legalization will lead to more sexually transmitted diseases.
One of the sources for the spread of HIV in Africa is prostitution. Studies conducted in Athens and Africa demonstrated a significant correlation between the spread of STDs, particularly HIV, and prostitution. Prostitution in developing urban settings, such as Kenya, acts as a reservoir of STDs within the general population.
Legalizing sex work will increase immoral behavior like pimping, organized crime, trafficking.
The United Nations stated in 2009 that sex trafficking is the most commonly identified form of human trafficking, comprising about 79% of cases, which are predominantly for prostitution. The legalization of prostitution can potentially lead to an increase in human trafficking and crime. Reports indicate that a large number of prostitutes in Amsterdam were being forced to work, being abused by pimps and criminal gangs, failing the goals of legalization.
Legalizing sex work will increase violence against women.
The rates of physical violence against prostitutes, particularly female sex workers, are exceptionally high. A study conducted by the University of Leeds in 2015 found that 47% of prostitutes had been victims of crime, including rape and robbery. Furthermore, a survey revealed that a significant number of sex workers had been physically assaulted, beaten, raped, or faced attempted rape by clients while working.
Selling one's body is immoral.
Certain feminists perceive prostitution as a form of male dominance over women, reducing her to a mere instrument of sexual pleasure for the client. They argue that the act of prostitution is not a mutual and equal sex act, considering it to be morally wrong."

Supporter's Stance:

Legalizing sex work boosts the economy.
Proponents argue that well-run prostitution could be a functional part of the economy. Historical examples such as the city of Seattle and the city of Amsterdam show that sex work can indeed be incorporated into the local economy.
Legalizing sex work increases sex workers' benefits (e.g. health care, safe sex, unionization, etc.).
The World Charter for Prostitutes Rights, drafted by the International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights, calls for the decriminalization of all aspects of adult prostitution. This advocacy aims to improve the living and working conditions of sex workers, recognizing their right to safety, health, human rights, and access to social benefits such as pensions.
Legalizing sex work will allow to regulate those in the profession.
A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent, and sexually transmitted diseases were correspondingly absent. This evidence suggests that regulation could play a key role in promoting safe practices within the industry, a claim further supported by Dutch attitudes favoring legalization and regulation.
Legalizing sex work will make the profession safer for women.
New Zealand's decriminalization of sex work has led to positive effects on prostitutes' safety and health. A book titled ""Taking the crime out of sex work"" that includes interviews with over 700 sex workers concludes that the decriminalisation had positive effects on safety and health.
Sex work is a valid choice over one's body.
Feminists for Free Expression argue that any consensual sexual activity between adults where compensation is involved should be considered a valid choice. They emphasize that such choices can lead to greater disposable income and access to upwardly mobile social circles and lifestyle options. Moreover, a 2009 study of subjective well-being of prostitutes found that sex work had become normalized for those surveyed."
We should legalize sex selection,-1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Some bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society . Charles Lockwood of Yale says, a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars..
    - Evidence 2: When combined with frequent social sex selection, this bias may produce a gender imbalance that has undesirable consequences..
    - Evidence 3: The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females..
    - Evidence 4: According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys..
    - Evidence 5: Today, around 140 million women are believed to be missing around the world – the result of son preference, including gender-biased sex selection, a form of discrimination. Since the 1990s, some areas have seen up to 25 per cent more male births than female births. The rise in sex selection is alarming as it reflects the persistent low status of women and girls. The resulting gender imbalance also has a damaging effect on societies..
- claim_2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son, while a deeply rooted son preference makes many families want a son..
    - Evidence 2: The combined factors of son preference, the one-child policy and the availability of prenatal sex-identification technology have allowed prenatal discrimination to spread since the mid-1980s in both urban and rural areas in China where abortion is legal..
    - Evidence 3: In addition, primary care physicians voiced the concerns that sex selection led to invasive medical interventions in the absence of therapeutic indications, contributed to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex, and was not a solution to domestic violence..
    - Evidence 4: It is sometimes suggested that so-called 'family balancing'- whereby families with two or more children of one sex, choose a child of the opposite sex- is a less objectionable use of sex selection. However, it is not clear that there is any difference between this and other cases. The motivation for such choices is still likely to be sexist, and any line to be drawn between 'acceptable' family balancing and unacceptable consumerism will be arbitrary and therefore unsustainable..
    - Evidence 5: One of the issues opponents are raising is the ethical and moral implication of breaking the law of nature, that is, the traditional way of conception without interfering with the gender of the unborn child. For them, parents should not act like “God” and deliberately choosing the sex of their baby..
- claim_3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: There is also the problem of son-preference: with greater sex selection technology, parents can abort a pregnancy if they know it is a female child..
    - Evidence 2: Compulsory measures-the one-child policy implemented in 1979ï¼Œaimed to control the size of families, and effectively meant a one-child family for most Chinese families-although there were some exceptions. (The policy was not enforced among the country's minority populations, and a number of exceptions among the majority Han populations.) Given a strong son preference, these compulsory measures resulted in a neglect of girls and in some cases led to female infanticide..
    - Evidence 3: In September 2013, Archbishop Peter Smith, Vice-President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, decried the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed against two doctors who accepted a request to perform an abortion as a means of sex selection, a procedure that is illegal in Britain and that Archbishop Smith described as one expression of what he called the injustice that abortion is to the unwanted child..
    - Evidence 4: Under the tradition of son preference and the one-child policy, missing females in China are formed through sex-selective abortion, discrimination in care for females, and non-registration of girls at birth..
    - Evidence 5: Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son..
","Debate Summary:

Topic: 'We should legalize sex selection'

Opponents' Arguments:
Claim 1: Sex selection can lead to gender imbalance.
Evidence: Evidence supporting this claim ranges from the perspective of bioethicists like Charles Lockwood of Yale who warns about the societal disruption that could arise from a skewed male-to-female ratio, to empirical examples from countries like China and India where sex selection has resulted in a significant gender imbalance. The United Nations also highlights the growing issue of missing women worldwide due to gender-biased sex selection and the long-term societal impact this could have.

Claim 2: Sex selection reaffirms gender stereotypes/biases.
Evidence: This argument is supported by examples of son preference in cultures such as China's, where girls have become 'unwanted' due to strict family-size limitations and son preference. Other evidence notes the potential perpetuation of gender stereotypes leading to neglect of the lesser-desired sex and the ethical concerns of disrupting the natural conception process.

Claim 3: Sex selection will create abortions/infanticide.
Evidence: Critics point out that greater access to sex selection technology could lead to more abortions, particularly of female fetuses, in cultures with strong son preference. There is evidence that such preferences have led to female infanticide and repeat abortions in some cases."
We should legalize sex selection,1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should legalize sex selection', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Every woman and man has a slight preference when it comes to baby’s gender. Most people forget their preference when a baby is born but one does harbor a wish to have a daughter or son. Such a desire can be fulfilled with the help of gender selection or choosing your baby’s gender. Without gender selection, it would be all about fate or luck and a couple may never have a desired gender for a baby. There are families who have five daughters in an attempt to have a son. And there are many families who keep having sons when they want a daughter. Other than getting a desire or wish fulfilled, choosing baby’s gender helps in instilling some gender balance in the family..
    - Evidence 2: Most families opt for unisex stuffs for babies before they are born. From clothes to toys, the color of the crib to the various necessities and accessories, everything is gender neutral in most cases. With gender selection or knowing baby’s gender can help every family to buy gender specific items. This not only does away with the ambiguity but actually helps the baby to get the best stuff as well. There is also a financial aspect as after the birthing of a baby, the parents always spend money on items that are for a boy or girl respectively. Knowing the gender or choosing gender allows for smart shopping during the trimesters. The economic advantage is not oft talked about but it is significant..
    - Evidence 3: Choosing baby’s gender may not appear as a freedom of choice for those looking at politically right things to say but if you consider the fact that parents get to choose the sex of their baby then it is indeed a desirable scenario. It isn’t always bias or perceptions that dictate decisions on gender. At times, it could be to prevent gender specific diseases from being passed onto a baby..
    - Evidence 4: The advantage selecting the gender of your baby in advance is that you are able plan for your family. This is because you will have just an adequate number of children raise. Consequently, you can be sure of giving them a good education and proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Perhaps one of the positive sides of applying the gender selection method is the opportunity of would-be parents to raise the number of children they want. In some countries, limiting the size of a family is encouraged. In fact, in China, there was a 1979 law which prohibited families to have more than one child although over the years, there had been some changes. Also, there are couples who want a specific gender for a first-born. With this practice now available, mothers need not have to give birth multiple times just so they can have a baby with the gender they prefer..
    - Evidence 2: Another advantage of sex selection which proponents find important is the capacity of parents to start a family. With having just enough number of children to raise, couples will be more capable to take care of their kids and give them good education as well as proper nutrition..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps, one of the most positive things about the procedure is that it gives parents effective control over the number of children they want. In some countries like China, for example, where couples are only allowed one or two child, gender selection gives would-be parents the opportunity to have a male child who will carry the father’s family name..
    - Evidence 4: There are many couples who want a certain number of kids. Most couples want two kids and they want one girl and one boy. This is the most common family size that people opt for. But in an attempt to have one girl and one boy, a family may end up with three girls and one boy or one girl and two boys. Couples may keep trying for another baby if they want a girl or boy. Gender selection can help them to have the boy or girl they want and then restrict the family size as per their desire..
    - Evidence 5: This is one of the positives of baby gender selection. This technology gives you an opportunity to raise the number of children they want. This is especially welcome where there is a limit to the family size. Most importantly, if you want a specific gender for your first-born you can achieve your goal. Overall, gender selection comes in handy where mothers no longer have to have many babies before they can have a baby of a gender they desire..
- claim_3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Less commonly viewed as a method of social sex selection, adoption affords families that have a gender preference a legal means of choosing offspring of a particular sex..
    - Evidence 2: For parents who have lost a child, whether in utero or post-birth, gender selection can be a very comforting option..
    - Evidence 3: Proponents believe that it is possible for a parent or parents to want a baby with a gender they prefer. If this is the case, they say that it would be best for the family, especially the child about to be born, if the gender of the baby is what the parents desire. This way, they will be more loving to the child. And if a family is already consist of four boys and the parents want a girl, being given the chance to choose the gender of the next child with the possibility of making their wishes come true will make the family happier..

    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex..
    - Evidence 2: Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases who are in the process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases..
    - Evidence 3: PGD can potentially be used to select embryos to be without a genetic disorder, to have increased chances of successful pregnancy, to match a sibling in HLA type in order to be a donor, to have less cancer predisposition, and for sex selection..
    - Evidence 4: nan.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: More horrific is the use of infanticide, where if a child of the unwanted sex is born, it is killed at birth (referred to as “gendercide”). Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to a preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females..
    - Evidence 2: Though most of our patients at HRC Fertility would be happy with a healthy infant of either sex, some have preferences for a son or a daughter or one or two children of each gender. Parents-to-be may not even realize they have an affinity for a specific gender until they have an option to choose. Reproductive medicine can give intended parents the ability to pick the sex of their children if they produce sufficient healthy embryos of the gender they prefer..

Supporters' Arguments:
Claim 1: It is within the freedoms of the parents to select the sex of the child.
Evidence: Supporters argue that parents should have the right to fulfill their desire for a child of a specific sex and that knowing the baby's sex in advance can offer financial and psychological benefits. Moreover, the selection can be used as a preventive measure against gender-specific diseases.

Claim 2: Sex selection allows for better family planning.
Evidence: Proponents argue that sex selection gives parents effective control over the number of children they want, which can be particularly beneficial in regions where family size is limited. They believe that with sex selection, couples can achieve the desired family composition without having to have multiple children.

Claim 3: Sex selection makes the family more happy/complete.
Evidence: Supporters of sex selection suggest that being able to choose the gender of a child could make families happier and feel more complete. This could particularly be the case for parents who have lost a child or for families who have children of only one gender.

Claim 4: Sex selection prevents diseases in the child.
Evidence: Sex selection can be used to prevent transmission of certain sex-linked diseases, which can be a powerful tool for parents concerned about the potential health risks for their children.

Claim 5: Sex selection will prevent abortions/infanticide.
Evidence: Proponents contend that sex selection could actually prevent the horrific practice of infanticide or 'gendercide,' particularly in cultures where one gender is strongly preferred over the other. They also suggest that it gives parents the chance to have a healthy baby of the desired gender without resorting to abortion."
We should prohibit flag burning,-1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit flag burning', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In common usage, the phrase 'flag burning' refers only to burning a flag as an act of protest..
    - Evidence 2: In December 1965, a group of five students, including lead plaintiff John Tinker and his sister Mary Beth Tinker, wore black armbands overlaid with a white peace sign between the dates of December 16 and New Years Day. The principals of the students' schools had previously threatened to suspend any students who participated in the protest. Despite the warning, the small group of students proceeded to carry out their dissent, and were duly suspended. ACLU attorneys representing the students argued that the armbands constituted a form of symbolic speech and, because their demonstration was suppressed, their First Amendment rights were unconstitutionally restrained. The court voted 7-2 in favor of Tinker, finding that the suspension had violated the First Amendment. Justice Fortas, delivering the opinion of the court, held the following:  In wearing armbands, the petitioners were quiet and passive. They were not disruptive, and did not impinge upon the rights of others. In these circumstances, their conduct was within the protection of the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth..
    - Evidence 3: The US Court found under the First Amendment there was not a sufficient governmental interest to justify regulating this form of symbolic speech. Although not a flag burning case, this represented the first time the Court had clearly stated that protest involving the physical use of the flag should be seen as a form of protected expression under the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: In 1984, during a protest against the policies of the Reagan administration in Dallas, Texas, Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag that was given to him by a fellow demonstrator with kerosene and set it alight while those around him chanted America the red, white and blue, we spit on you. He was later arrested and convicted on a flag desecration law in Texas, and sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court ruled 5 to 4 in favor of Johnson. Justice Brennan wrote that because such other actions in relation to the flag (such as saluting, and displaying) are considered to be a form of expression, so must too the burning be, and that Johnson's protest was Sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to implicate the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 5: Miller's attorney held that symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible..
- claim_2: flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 2: the Johnson majority found the lack of evidence for flag protection in the Constitution that necessitated the claim of uniqueness to counter indicate protection of the flag from free speech. They answered the uniqueness claim directly: We have not recognized an exception to [bedrock First Amendment principles] even where our flag has been involved... There is, moreover, no indication-either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it-that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone..We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.
    - Evidence 3: Justice William Brennan, in his majority opinion asserted that the act of burning a flag was considered an expressive activity which is protected by the First Amendment..
    - Evidence 4: Justice William Brennan wrote for a five-justice majority in holding that the defendant Gregory Lee Johnson's act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution..
    - Evidence 5: While flag desecration - like virulent ethnic and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and scurrilous caricatures - is deeply offensive to many, the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable..
","Summary of Debate Arguments:

Opposing Stance: 'We should not prohibit flag burning'

Claim 1: Flag burning is an effective tool of expression/protest/critique.
Supporting evidence includes historical cases such as Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District in 1965, where symbolic protest was protected under the First Amendment and the case of Gregory Lee Johnson in 1984 where flag burning was considered a form of expression. Both of these cases highlight the importance of the First Amendment in protecting individuals' right to symbolic speech, even when it involves actions that may be controversial or offensive to some.

Claim 2: Flag burning is justified due to freedom of expression.
Key evidence includes the 1989 Supreme Court decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, which reiterated that flag desecration was a form of expressive activity protected by the First Amendment. The court declined to create an exception for the American flag, thereby underscoring that the principle of free speech, even if offensive or disagreeable to some, is paramount in the Constitution."

","Supporting Stance: 'We should prohibit flag burning'

Claim 1: Flags are important symbols that should be respected.
Evidence supporting this claim includes different nations' laws such as Turkey's 1983 flag law and Austria's Strafgesetzbuch, which outlaw flag desecration due to its symbolic significance. Chief Justice Warren's stance that not all symbolic speech falls under First Amendment protection also bolsters this claim.

Claim 2: Flag burning is an inflammatory act.
In support of this claim, Justice Rehnquist's argument compares flag burning to an 'inarticulate grunt or roar,' intended to antagonize rather than express an idea. Incidents like Khalid's 2003 anti-US protest in Ras-Al Khaimah, where flag burning incited a crowd, also illustrate how flag desecration can fuel tensions. Additionally, laws like the one in Hong Kong that classify flag desecration as a public offense illustrate global perspectives on the inflammatory nature of flag burning."
We should prohibit women in combat,-1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: There should be equality between men and women..
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Gender equality helps prevent violence against women and girls and makes our communities safer and healthier. It is a human right and it is good for the economy..
    - Evidence 2: Women’s impact doesn’t stop with individual companies and organizations. Studies show that increasing women’s participation in the economy is good for the economy. In OECD countries, if the female employment rates were raised to match Sweden, it would lead to a GDP increase equivalent to $6 trillion. Gender pay gaps end up costing the economy..
    - Evidence 3: We need gender equality urgently. Gender equality prevents violence against women and girls. It’s essential for economic prosperity. Societies that value women and men as equal are safer and healthier. Gender equality is a human right. Everyone benefits from gender equality..
    - Evidence 4: Twenty-five years after the United Nations’ Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action pledged to take the necessary steps to “remove all obstacles to gender equality and the advancement and empowerment of women,” support for gender equality is strong around the globe. Across 34 countries surveyed by Pew Research Center, a median of 94% think it is important for women in their country to have the same rights as men, with 74% saying this is very important..
    - Evidence 5: In health, fewer mothers are dying in childbirth and significant increases in female life expectancy have followed. With few exceptions, women now outlive men in virtually every country. In terms of labor participation, more women in countries at every level of income have been engaging in economic activities beyond non-market work in the home..
- claim_2: Women are an asset in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Most people don’t realize that women have fought alongside men since the Revolutionary War. The roles may have been different than the men, but women still served and fought. The roles of women in the military have evolved over the years and the opportunities continue to expand in different fields. Women in the military have always proven themselves to be an asset despite some of the beliefs of many that women do not belong in the military, let alone in combat..
    - Evidence 2: As a health professional and a researcher, Mar Nagel found that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions. They have better social and communication skills than men, possess strong memory, are sophisticated and show precision and fast reaction and response time..
    - Evidence 3: Fewer Disciplinary Problems: The average woman recruit is much less likely than a male recruit to become a discipline problem. Women lose far less time than men for absence without leave, desertion, alcoholism and drug abuse..
    - Evidence 4: that warfare is changing and becoming so high-tech that hand-to-hand combat is rare, making physical strength less important; and that women who qualify for combat posts can beat back the enemy with great skill..
    - Evidence 5: A study on UK soldiers who fought in Iraq in 2006 showed a lack of gender differences in veterans who had post-traumatic stress disorder. This suggests that combat doesn’t pose a higher risk to women’s mental health than it does to men’s. In fact, psychological research has shown that female soldiers in combat may be more resilient to its effects than male soldiers. Women don’t need to be “protected” from the difficulties of combat units – they can take the heat..
- claim_3: Women can create unique skills/strategies.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: In fact, there are certain combat positions for which women provide a unique tactical advantage in counterinsurgency operations. Male service members, for example, are prohibited from looking at or speaking to Afghan women on patrols and from touching them at routine checkpoints to search for weapons and explosives—a challenge that poses a security risk that only female service members are equipped to address..
    - Evidence 2: Women can and do bring different skills and perspectives to the table and often approach problems differently. Some women have proven themselves able to demonstrate leadership and articulate new ideas better than some of their male counterparts. Women like Capt. Shaye Haver or Capt. Kris Griest, the first two female Ranger School graduates; or my female executive officer, my highly competent second-in-command; or Rezagul, the Afghan woman who killed twenty-five Taliban fighters; or any of the Army women’s rugby players—any of these would undoubtedly make any infantry unit better, stronger, and more lethal..
    - Evidence 3: Perhaps the first instance of organized women’s soldiering in a modern, industrialized, and egalitarian, although not democratic society was the Soviet Army during the Second World War. This war, in which the stock of available male recruits was seriously depleted, saw brigades of women snipers roaming the front lines killing Germans with advanced telescopic rifles at a distance, again negating the physical disadvantage of women in close-quarter combat..
    - Evidence 4: The more complete integration of women into men's units will make the military a more effective force by introducing more diverse viewpoints. Being able to tackle problems from many perspectives can be useful to the military's mission in a rapidly changing world. In Iraq, female troops have proven useful at gaining the trust of Iraqi women and children, an area in which male soldiers have failed..
    - Evidence 5: Women serving as SOE agents during the Second World War were in many ways the equivalent of contemporary women serving in combat units. Violette Szabo, Odette Sansom, Lise de Baissac, Noor Inyat Khan and Denise Bloch were all ordinary women who did extraordinary things. Recruited as spies, they received intensive training and were parachuted into France. Performing a number of dangerous missions, they demonstrated remarkable skill, courage and inner strength..
- claim_4: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: According to Nindl, et al. (p. 51, 2016), training programs increased the number of pull-ups that women were capable of, demonstrating that they could overcome their naturally smaller muscle mass. Additionally, their research found that women performed better than men in ultra-endurance, or the ability to physical endure for a given extended period of time. These studies suggest that women excel in some abilities, and that while men are indeed stronger as a physical typicality, there are exceptions and other ways that women can compete..
    - Evidence 2: Advocates of gender integration say women are fully capable of performing the difficult and sometimes brutal tasks involved with combat, and they point out that even though women have been barred officially from combat duties in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers have nonetheless fought and died there..
    - Evidence 3: In 1917, Russian commanders authorized the creation of the 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, led by Maria Bochkareva. In July, the battalion participated in an offensive against German trenches near Smorgon. According to Bochkareva’s autobiography and other corroborating sources, the Women’s Battalion was the first of the Russian units to go over the top of the Russian trenches and advance across no man’s land under heavy fire. Although initially hesitant, the male units quickly followed the battalion’s lead, overcoming two German trench lines before Bochkareva perceived the vulnerability of a third and pressed her soldiers forward to swiftly seize it. Ordered to hold the lines and await reinforcements, the battalion repulsed a number of counterattacks of numerically superior German forces and retreated only when Russian commanders informed Bochkareva reinforcements would not arrive and ordered her to withdraw..
    - Evidence 4: From the Revolutionary War to present day conflicts, women have proudly served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard as nurses, pilots, engineers, soldiers and other specialties. During World War I, about 35,000 women officially served as nurses and support staff. During World War II, 140,000 women served in the U.S. Army and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) performing critical jobs such as military intelligence, cryptography and parachute rigging. Over 1,000 women flew aircraft for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)..

  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: To be frank, the arguments for keeping women from fighting in combat are sexist and stupid. The idea that women might hurt “unit cohesion” is objectifying, and the argument that women are too weak to fight has been proven false by female athlete after female athlete, not to mention by the women already serving in the army..
    - Evidence 2: In the field, you don’t care whether the soldier next to you is male or female—all you care about is whether they will get the job done and save you and your platoon a weekend’s worth of extra duty..
    - Evidence 3: For example, female medics in Nad Ali came under fire just as much as the male medics with them. One of the medics, Sgt. Chanelle Taylor, was the first soldier to kill an enemy up close in Afghanistan, and she provided invaluable insight to her command team. If women are already unofficially serving on the battlefield – and excelling at it – they should get the credit they deserve and be allowed to serve in combat units..
    - Evidence 4: A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study concluded that women performed the same as men..
    - Evidence 5: Women are more effective in some circumstances than men. Allowing women to serve doubles the talent pool for delicate and sensitive jobs that require interpersonal skills not every soldier has.

Ernst said a woman wouldn’t necessarily be fighting on the frontlines. She could choose to serve in the infantry if she met the standard, Ernst said. “She could also serve in a cyber unit, where she is sitting behind the lines where she's safe, but certainly working to disrupt the enemy. All of these jobs are important.”.
    - Evidence 2: Many have argued that there are biological differences that limit the physical capacity of women.

","Summary of Debate Material:

Topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat'

Stance: Opponents argue against the prohibition

Claim: There should be equality between men and women.

Evidence: Support for gender equality is strong globally, evidenced by a Pew Research Center survey revealing a median of 94% of participants across 34 countries believe it's important for women to have the same rights as men. It's also economically beneficial, as studies show that increased female participation in the economy boosts GDP.
Claim: Women are an asset in combat.

Evidence: Historically, women have proven to be a valuable asset in military operations. Furthermore, Mar Nagel's research indicates that women often excel in cognitive and strategic decisions, exhibiting strong memory, precision, and quick reaction time. Additionally, studies suggest women do not experience higher risks of post-traumatic stress disorder than men, proving their mental resilience in combat scenarios.
Claim: Women can create unique skills/strategies.

Evidence: Women offer unique tactical advantages in certain combat situations, such as counterinsurgency operations where cultural norms may restrict male service members. They also bring diverse perspectives and problem-solving approaches, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of military forces.
Claim: Women can overcome differences and be just as capable in combat.

Evidence: Research by Nindl, et al., showed that with proper training, women can overcome natural physical disparities. Additionally, examples from history like the 1st Russian WomenÕs Battalion of Death and the Women's Army Corps (WAC) during World War II demonstrate women's bravery and capabilities on the battlefield.
Claim: Women should be able to serve in combat if they choose to.

Evidence: Advocates argue that gender-based restrictions in combat roles are unfounded and sexist. They stress that the efficacy of soldiers on the battlefield is not determined by gender but by their ability to execute their duties effectively. A 2010 British Ministry of Defense study also concluded that women performed the same as men.
Claim: Women should be accepted as long as they pass the tests.

Evidence: Critics argue that individual assessment, not gender, should be the determining factor in military fitness. Advocates like Senator Joni Ernst note that women can excel in various roles within the military if they meet the standard. The introduction of gender-neutral Physical Employment Standards by the Army serves as a recent example of efforts to ensure fair assessment."
We should prohibit women in combat,1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should prohibit women in combat', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Men are better suited to combat roles than women.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: It is a biological fact that women are generally physically smaller than men, with less bone mass and less muscle density. Female body chemistry makes it harder for women to achieve and sustain high levels of fitness. Even the strongest female athlete will have less upper body strength than her male equivalent. To quote a veteran of Afghanistan: It’s the reason why there are no women in the England Rugby Team. Or as another serving soldier said: “Women just cannot carry as much kit as men..
    - Evidence 2: Women are physically smaller than men and lack the same potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. This view is supported by the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine..
    - Evidence 3: A yearlong Marine Corps study found that all-male units were faster, more lethal, and able to evacuate quicker than integrated units of men and women. Sources claim that the military is easing fitness standards because the female soldiers can’t meet them; lowering such standards hurts the institution as a whole..
    - Evidence 4: Physical differences may still be a hindrance to women serving in combat units..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: Although women have been involved in combat skirmishes, ground-combat service requires sustained combat, sometimes over the course of days or weeks, often under loads substantially exceeding that of the soldier of World War II. This is a disastrous decision made by people (a re-elected president and an outgoing secretary of defense) who will not have to bear its consequences. Instead theywill be suffered by the soldier on the ground, and in some cases they are likely to be fatal..
    - Evidence 2: In an interview with CNN on January 4, Maj. General Robert Dees, the campaign chair for Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, said he didn’t think it was a good idea: “If you look at the population demographics, most women…cannot properly carry a 230-pound soldier—with a rucksack and combat vest on—off of the battlefield to save his life..
    - Evidence 3: While the majority of jobs in the armed forces are open equally to men and women, there are some to which women are just not physically suited. The standards of physical fitness have been set to suit men, and women attempting to reach them will over-stretch themselves.  In addition, combat units engage in activities designed to suit men’s capabilities. Women serving in integrated units will suffer higher injury rates as a result of this..
    - Evidence 4: More than seven months after the official launch of the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, nearly half of female soldiers are still falling short, with enlisted women struggling the most, Military.com has learned. The data again raises questions about whether the Army's attempt to create a fitter force is creating more barriers to success for women..
    - Evidence 5: The US Army is considering reversing gender neutral physical tests because women are overwhelmingly failing to keep up with their male counterparts. The results showed that an overwhelming majority of the women failed to clear the tests while almost 90% of the men managed to pass them..
- claim_3: Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: While it may be a feel-good move for many progressives, the end result might well be to lower the standards for all troops and damage the quality of the military..
    - Evidence 2: Lower female standards also reinforce the belief that women cannot perform the same job as men, therefore making it difficult for women to earn the trust and confidence of their teammates..
    - Evidence 3: Inconvenient truth is that men and women have been each other’s most consistent distraction since the beginning of time. To pretend that we don’t know what will happen when men and women are thrown together for prolonged periods in emotionally intense situations defies common sense. Being overly academic and insufficiently adult about adult behavior isn’t just irresponsible but imperiling, and belies the deadly seriousness with which we should want combat units to perform..
    - Evidence 4: When men and women are posted to the same unit for extended overseas tours they will naturally form attachments. There may be instances of fraternisation where male and female soldiers have sexual relations with multiple partners within the same chain of command. These may include extra-marital affairs that undermine longstanding relationships with partners back home. In some instances, such episodes may degrade unit cohesion, foster petty rivalries, incite jealousy or feelings of resentment. They can impact unit morale, undermine teamwork and risk reducing operational effectiveness..
    - Evidence 5: However, mixed-gender teams in close combat roles where they are required to kill the enemy face-to-face could have far reaching and grave consequences, the Ministry of Defence said today..
- claim_4: Women should serve in safer roles.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: In the Second World War, British Government records show that 640,000 women served in non-combat roles. Even Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II trained as a mechanic in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. Female roles included pilots, ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics and nurses. Again, many thousands paid the ultimate price for their service..
    - Evidence 2: Researchers have identified a dominant “warrior culture” among many male soldiers in the Canadian armed forces, especially those in combat arms. Adherence to this way of thinking equates women with weakness, an excess of emotion and the need to be protected..
    - Evidence 3: 1988 – The DoD convenes its Task Force on Women in the Military and adopts the “risk rule,” which excludes women from combat units or missions which risk exposure to direct combat, hostile fire, or capture..
    - Evidence 4: The idea that women give birth and have a naturally nurturing disposition, or – more practically – that the death of a woman in battle could leave young children motherless..
    - Evidence 5: In 2014, the IDF said that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions such as infantry, artillery units, fighter pilots, etc. Rather, they are concentrated in combat-support..
- claim_5: Women soldier capture is a big concern.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: It is a certainty. History shows it. Every female soldier captured in the wars with Iraq was raped. Even the female helo pilot who suffered two broken arms and a leg..
    - Evidence 2: Women do not possess the same mental resilience and resistance to fatigue as men. They are less able to resist cold, interrogation and stress, because they are physiologically and psychologically weaker with less control of their emotions. This means that female soldiers are likely to be less consistent and dependable than male soldiers in tough situations. Or as one ex-soldier put it:  You can’t have a women in your platoon who starts crying as soon as the going gets tough..

","Debate Summary:

Topic: ""We should prohibit women in combat""

Proponents of this stance argue based on five main points:

Men are better suited to combat roles than women. They back this with biological facts such as women generally being physically smaller, possessing less bone mass and muscle density, and having less potential to achieve ultimate physical fitness. They cite a yearlong Marine Corps study that showed all-male units were more efficient and lethal than integrated units, thereby supporting their claim that the physical differences can be a hindrance in combat units.

Women cannot overcome physical/emotional/mental barriers. They contend that ground-combat service requires sustained engagement that may overburden women. They underscore that a large number of female soldiers have fallen short of the Army Combat Fitness Test, and point to the US Army reconsidering gender-neutral physical tests due to overwhelming failures among women.

Women in combat can be a distraction or harm the function of the military. This argument emphasizes potential issues such as lowering troop standards and the possibility of forming romantic relationships among soldiers, which could degrade unit cohesion and compromise operational effectiveness.

Women should serve in safer roles. This claim emphasizes that women have historically served successfully and safely in non-combat roles such as ambulance drivers, clerks, mechanics, and nurses, highlighting that combat is not the only means of service.

The capture of female soldiers poses a significant concern. Proponents cite historical examples where female soldiers captured in conflict were violated, arguing that women could be more susceptible to stress and fatigue, potentially making them less reliable in intense situations.

In conclusion, the proponents argue for the prohibition of women in combat citing concerns about physical ability, mental resilience, the potential for distraction, the suitability of women for non-combat roles, and the risks associated with capture."

","Debate Summary

Topic: 'We should subsidize journalism'

Stance: Opposition

Claim: Government intervention has the risk of inserting bias/harming objectivity.
Evidence: The Public Journalism Network outlines that journalism and democracy function optimally when news flows freely, portraying a diverse range of life and culture from all communities, and when it facilitates public deliberation and political participation rather than just consumption. Government funding could infringe on this, leading to the press's compromised objectivity, favoritism, and sensationalism.

Claim: It is preferable to spend the money elsewhere.
Evidence: In today's age of diverse print, broadcast, and digital communication forms, federal subsidies could inadvertently favor inefficient companies and hinder entrepreneurs, thus posing as a potential obstacle to innovation and efficiency.

Claim: Journalism is like every other business and if it is not sustainable it should fail.
Evidence: The federal government's financial limitations make it impractical to bail out failing newspapers, as has happened with banks and automobile manufacturers in the past. This risks burdening taxpayers further and making journalism overly dependent on a debt-burdened government."
We should subsidize journalism,1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize journalism', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: In Europe, the European Court of Human Rights stated in the 1996 case of Goodwin v. United Kingdom that protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom .. Without such protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public on matters of public interest..
    - Evidence 2: Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism..
    - Evidence 3: According to a Zogby International survey, 70% of Americans say journalism is important to maintaining community quality of life, and 67% say the traditional media are out of touch with what citizens want from their news..
    - Evidence 4: Soldatov believes WikiLeaks is filling the gap left by the decline of investigative journalism with a sensationalist alternative while journalistic support of WikiLeaks is motivated by anger over declining funding and resources for investigative reporting..
    - Evidence 5: When news media lost a sizable percentage of their advertising revenues in the pandemic, state subsidies became more important than ever in securing the financial viability of media markets..
- claim_2: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: The Associated Press became increasingly important and efficient, producing a vast quantity of reasonably accurate, factual reporting on state and national events that editors used to service the escalating demand for news..
    - Evidence 2: A study authorized by the Trilateral Commission in 1975 to examine the governability of American democracy found that the most notable new source of national power in 1970, as compared to 1950, was the national media, suggesting also that there was considerable evidence to suggest that the development of television journalism contributed to the undermining of governmental authority..
    - Evidence 3: Solutions journalism practitioners say the approach augments and complements the press' traditional watchdog role, presenting citizens with a more complete view of issues. In addition, they say, it can enhance the impact of investigative reporting, by presenting evidence that entrenched problems can, in fact, be solved..
    - Evidence 4: MacLean argues that education in journalism helps empower members of the public to understand how media work..
    - Evidence 5: In the words of a 2011 report from the Oxford School for the Study of Journalism and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, Mainstream media is the lifeblood of topical social media conversations in the UK..
- claim_3: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: The IFJ launched the Ethical Journalism Initiative in 2008, a global campaign to defend standards and to raise awareness of the importance of quality journalism..
    - Evidence 2: The IPD journalism program helps strengthen journalists' economic literacy and equips them to report and write about the major economic issues confronting developing economies..
    - Evidence 3: The rationale is that by providing subsidies, the European Union can encourage new entrants and small players to compete against the powerful incumbents. By introducing voters to different ideas, highlighting conflicting opinions and encouraging debate between them, a media-plural Europe would better facilitate democratic decision-making, especially in the era of fake news..

","Debate Summary

Topic: 'We should subsidize journalism'

Stance: Supporters

Claim: A subsidy is important to make journalism viable.
Evidence: State subsidies have played a crucial role in maintaining the financial viability of media markets, particularly during challenging periods such as the pandemic. Furthermore, a Zogby International survey shows that a majority of Americans believe journalism plays a significant role in maintaining community quality of life.

Claim: Journalism is important to information-spreading/accountability.
Evidence: The development of television journalism has contributed to undermining governmental authority, as per a study authorized by the Trilateral Commission in 1975. Additionally, solutions journalism presents citizens with a complete view of issues, supporting the traditional watchdog role of the press and showing that entrenched problems can be solved.

Claim: Subsidies will increase the quality of journalism.
Evidence: The Ethical Journalism Initiative launched by the IFJ in 2008 aims to defend standards and raise awareness about the importance of quality journalism. Subsidies can promote media pluralism, encouraging the entry of new and small players and facilitating democratic decision-making, which is especially relevant in the era of fake news.

Claim: Subsidy increases objectivity in reporting.
Evidence: Peace journalism, by presenting local perspectives that contradict violence-exacerbating war journalism, helps expose attempts by violent groups to promote their violence, thereby enhancing objectivity in reporting."
We should subsidize space exploration,-1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its opponents argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can be carried by the private sector.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: paceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic — achieved key feats in space travel previously reserved to countries. They transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flew space enthusiasts into space, delivered cargo to low Earth orbit and developed reusable booster rockets..
    - Evidence 2: Musk’s SpaceX in particular has demonstrated the commercial ventures can be successful and help bolster NASA. For years SpaceX has flown cargo and supplies for the space agency to the ISS. NASA has expanded that public-private partnership, allowing SpaceX to fly its most precious resources—its astronauts—to the space station as well. The company also recently won a $3 billion contract to develop the spacecraft that would ferry astronauts to and from the surface of the moon..
    - Evidence 3: After investing billions of dollars into the ISS, NASA cannot afford to build another space station in Earth orbit, especially as it is embarking on an effort to return humans to the moon, under a program called Artemis. Instead, it is looking to the private sector to develop next-generation habitats that would be owned and operated by the companies, not NASA. The space agency has recently taken the first major steps in that direction, reaching an agreement with Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that has hired Starck, to send a module of its space station to attach to the ISS as a test bed as soon as 2024. Late last year, NASA awarded contracts to develop commercial space stations, worth $415.6 million combined, to Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Nanoracks, which helps companies fly science experiments and other payloads to the ISS, and Northrop Grumman, the longtime defense contractor..
    - Evidence 4: In recent years, NASA has teamed up with private, for-profit rocket companies to transport humans to outer space. Such partnerships launched billionaire Richard Branson into space via his private company Virgin Galactic on July 11, with assistance from NASA. Other for-profit organizations, including Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX hope to follow. Such partnerships between government agencies and private companies aspire to expand space exploration at a rapid rate..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_2: Space exploration is expensive.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: After all is said and done about what went wrong, the bottom line is simple: money. It's about $10,000 to put a pound of anything into a near-earth orbit. (Imagine John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth, made of solid gold, and you can appreciate the enormous cost of space travel.) It costs $500 to $700 million every time the shuttle flies. Billionaire space tourists have flown to the space station at a reputed price of $20 million per head..
    - Evidence 2: So long as we rely on chemical propulsion to lift us into orbit, space travel will never be cheap. The Tsiolkovsky equation shows that a rocket needs between 10 and 25 times as much propellant as the mass that it’s lifting into orbit. To partly get around this, all rocket designs use multiple stages that are discarded during flight to reduce the dead weight as you ascend. But replacing – or recovering and then reusing – these stages isn’t cheap either. We’re also only just beginning the first generation of commercial passenger spaceflight, so there are all the R&D costs to pay off, still..
    - Evidence 3: Rockets and spaceflight instruments do not assemble themselves. They are designed and built by people, who get paid. They are fabricated from components which have to be manufactured and then purchased. The community engaged in the space industry includes specialist scientists and engineers, designers, graphic artists and IT professionals, as well as a vast support system: HR, catering, cleaning, etc..
    - Evidence 4: These space programs and agencies are very costly. It is estimated that the total annual budget of space agencies is $41.8 billion..
    - Evidence 5: The money being spent on space exploration cost the billions and it has done a lot of advanced technology which would possibly have come anyway by other means. Space exploration is costly, difficult ,harsh ,perilous and risky..
- claim_3: Space exploration is ineffective.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Bill Nye explains why space exploration is a waste of time..
    - Evidence 2: The shuttle and space station are scientifically useless. The Apollo missions were scientifically useless. The Moon/Mars missions will be scientifically useless. Humans in space are scientifically useless, absolutely..
    - Evidence 3: Satellite technology has of course had a beneficial effect on our world. However, there is a huge difference between launching satellites into Earth orbit, and exploring space. Missions to other planets, and into interstellar space, do not contribute to life on our planet. Moreover, satellites are largely commercial - they are launched by private companies, and are maintained by the profits which they lead to. True space exploration could never be commercial, and requires huge government subsidies - the Voyager missions alone cost just under $1 billion. This money could be much better spent elsewhere..
    - Evidence 4: Space travel is responsible for large amounts of pollution. Inverse says that, “The SpaceX Falcon 9 and NASA Space Shuttle both produce around 400 tons of carbon dioxide per launch.” Keep in mind that this amount of pollution comes from only one rocket, never mind the hundreds of other launches. With the world’s recent focus on reducing emissions, why has the space industry gone nearly unscathed?.
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: There are issues more important to fund than space exploration.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration is not necessarily something that we need right now. However, poverty is a contemporary issue.  In fact, according to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day due to poverty..
    - Evidence 2: Space exploration is a waste of resources and its dangerous to , so may accident and problems happened in the space like shattering of space vehicles , explosions, pieces falling off and missing the gravity of earth , that is even waste more money to fix them..
    - Evidence 3: Even if there are benefits to space exploration, spending so much money and effort in reaching other planets is highly questionable. That money and brain power could be used to solve other more important problems for us. For instance governments could invest much more to prevent global warming, reduce crime rates and find a cure for cancer or Alzheimer's Disease..
    - Evidence 4: There are a number of ways to spend a $19.3 billion annual budget; we could pay for 1.94 million young adults in the United States to attend a public 4-year university, we could provide 1.87 million people with health care, or we could use the money to fund the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for one year..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
","In the debate about whether or not we should subsidize space exploration, the opponents of this proposal have raised several key arguments:

Firstly, they argue that space exploration can be carried out by the private sector. They support this claim by providing examples of private companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic, who have achieved significant milestones in space travel. They've transported astronauts to the International Space Station, flown private individuals into space, developed reusable rockets, and won substantial contracts from NASA. SpaceX's successes, in particular, demonstrate that commercial ventures can be both successful and beneficial to national space agencies.

Secondly, opponents argue that space exploration is prohibitively expensive. They point out that launching objects into space is currently very costly, requiring significant amounts of propellant per mass lifted into orbit, and the cost to recover and reuse discarded rocket stages is also high. Furthermore, the extensive human resources involved in space industry, including scientists, engineers, and support staff, add to the overall cost, with the annual budget for space agencies estimated to be $41.8 billion.

The third argument opponents put forward is that space exploration is ineffective. They reference opinions like that of Bill Nye who states that space exploration is a waste of time, and argue that missions such as the Apollo and shuttle programs were scientifically useless. They also note that while satellites do have practical applications, other types of space exploration like interplanetary missions do not contribute to life on our planet and generate significant pollution.

Lastly, opponents of space exploration subsidies contend that there are more pressing issues that require funding. They highlight the prevalence of global poverty, the need for more affordable education and healthcare, the importance of addressing climate change, and the pursuit of solutions for major health problems like cancer and Alzheimer's disease. They argue that the substantial resources spent on space exploration could be redirected to address these more immediate needs.

Thus, the opponents of subsidizing space exploration present a compelling argument focusing on the capabilities of the private sector, the exorbitant costs of space travel, the lack of tangible benefits, and the opportunity cost of allocating funds to space exploration over more pressing societal needs."
We should subsidize space exploration,1.0,gpt4,all_baseline,"Given the topic: 'We should subsidize space exploration', Its positive supporters argue that:
- claim_1: Space exploration can help in colonizing the resources/lands of other planets.
  Evidence supporting claim_1:
    - Evidence 1: Space colonies can supply clean energy necessary for human survival in the 21st century. In addition, they can provide new homelands and an expanded ecological niche for our species..
    - Evidence 2: Ultimately, space colonies could be built anywhere in the solar system. By increasing the size of the mirrors used to direct sunlight into the living and agricultural sections, it would be possible to support habitats beyond the orbit of Pluto if we so desire. Given the known resources of the asteroids, there is sufficient material to construct habitats capable of supporting populations thousands of times larger than that of Earth. By increasing our ecological niche to include the solar system, the human species would become much less likely to be destroyed by a single natural or made-man catastrophe..
    - Evidence 3: The most common ideas for space colonization include: settling Earth’s Moon, building on Mars, and constructing free-floating space stations..
    - Evidence 4: Space exploration isn’t simply a sign of humanity’s hubris or a brazen desire to find new places to live and new sources of wealth. If we take the risk of venturing beyond our terrestrial home, it’s also to learn more about ourselves and our planet, improve life on Earth, and maybe, just maybe, find or create a new future for our children, says Walter Cugno, Vice President Exploration and Science Domain at Thales Alenia Space..
    - Evidence 5: It’s time to ask ourselves the big question: Should we try to colonize our solar system, or not? I’ll readily admit I’m for it, and I suspect a large portion of the space community would stand with me – but this isn’t the space community’s decision, or in fact, any single nation’s decision. A broad consensus of commercial, civil, defense and international parties will be essential to an undertaking of this magnitude and complexity..
- claim_2: Space exploration improves science/technology.
  Evidence supporting claim_2:
    - Evidence 1: As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars..
    - Evidence 2: Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence..
    - Evidence 3: An artist’s concept of New Horizons during the spacecraft’s planned encounter with Pluto and its moon Charon. The craft’s miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers, and space plasma experiments would characterize the global geology and geomorphology of Pluto and Charon, map their surface compositions and temperatures, and examine Pluto’s atmosphere in detail..
    - Evidence 4: Satellite imagery and climate data also supports sectors like agriculture, offering benefits to the communities they serve. Amazon Web Services and Digital Earth Africa use Open Data Cube to make global satellite data more accessible and can be used to help farmers improve food production to reduce hunger, tackle unregulated mining and its knock-on effects, and identify new opportunities for economic growth..
    - Evidence 5: After Gagarin’s 1961 flight, space missions involving human crews carried out a range of significant research, from on-site geologic investigations on the Moon to a wide variety of observations and experiments aboard orbiting spacecraft. In particular, the presence in space of humans as experimenters and, in some cases, as experimental subjects facilitated studies in biomedicine and materials science..
- claim_3: Space exploration is financially beneficial.
  Evidence supporting claim_3:
    - Evidence 1: Dollars spent for space exploration create jobs, jumpstart businesses, and grow the economy. Our innovations improve daily life, advance medical research, support disaster response, and more. We're constantly evolving and finding new ways to add value..
    - Evidence 2: Many countries around the world invest in space science and exploration as a balanced part of their total federal budget. Public opinion research has shown that people estimate NASA to take up as much as a quarter of the U.S. federal budget, but in fact, NASA’s budget only represents about 0.5% of the total federal budget and the proportion is even smaller for other spacefaring nations..
    - Evidence 3: Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of more than $1 trillion or more in 2040, up from $350 billion, currently. Yet, the most significant short- and medium-term opportunities may come from satellite broadband Internet access..
    - Evidence 4: Morgan Stanley estimates that satellite broadband will represent 50% of the projected growth of the global space economy by 2040—and as much as 70% in the most bullish scenario. Launching satellites that offer broadband Internet service will help to drive down the cost of data, just as demand for that data explodes. The demand for data is growing at an exponential rate, while the cost of access to space (and, by extension, data) is falling by orders of magnitude, says Jonas. We believe the largest opportunity comes from providing Internet access to under- and unserved parts of the world, but there also is going to be increased demand for bandwidth from autonomous cars, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and video..
    - Evidence 5: nan.
- claim_4: Space exploration is necessary for the future survival of humanity.
  Evidence supporting claim_4:
    - Evidence 1: Every year, about a thousand technical innovations generated in the space program find their ways into our earthly technology where they lead to better kitchen appliances and farm equipment, better sewing machines and radios, better ships and airplanes, better weather forecasting and storm warning, better communications, better medical instruments, better utensils and tools for everyday life..
    - Evidence 2: Space Exploration for the Survival of the Human Race.
    - Evidence 3: Spaceflight isn’t just a master-minded escape plan for the richest among us, though. The key to saving our planet, and humanity, partly relies on the innovations from space exploration. The commercial sector has already adopted inventions that were funded or designed by space agencies. These include several ecology-based projects like one that uses LED light color that triggers growth for indoor agriculture or satellites used to predict the weather and document climate change. Space technologies are evolving and can help us harness a more sustainable world..
    - Evidence 4: Scientists use the data from these next-generation satellites – which take measurements every 85 centimeters along the ground path – to hopefully improve forecasts for rising sea levels and global weather and climate patterns..
    - Evidence 5: Consider how one day, we will build outposts on the moon and Mars that must replicate and sustain all of our planet’s life-giving essentials off-world. As such, we will need technologies capable of recycling essential resources like water, food, air to make these planets renewable and self-sustaining for current and future space exploration missions. It’s the progress we make in developing these innovations that we will continue to harness as models to preserve Earth’s wellbeing. It’s safe to say, the way to sustainability is up..
- claim_5: Space exploration unravels information about the universe.
  Evidence supporting claim_5:
    - Evidence 1: Space exploration of our solar system and distant galaxies in the furthest reaches of the Universe is important to top-level science and the answers to many fundamental scientific questions including formation of the Universe, the origin of Earth, Evolution of life, and the Existence of life beyond the Earth. Space robotics plays a critical role in the current and future space exploration missions, and enables mission-defined machines that are capable of surviving in the space environment, and performing exploration, assembly, construction, maintenance, or servicing tasks..
    - Evidence 2: From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system..
    - Evidence 3: The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, galaxies, stars, and planetary systems..
    - Evidence 4: space exploration, investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches of the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowledge of the cosmos and benefit humanity..

","Topic: ""We should subsidize vocational education""

Opposing Stance:

The opponents argue that subsidizing vocational education is detrimental for several reasons.

Diversion from More Worthy Causes: Critics argue that subsidizing vocational education may take away from more deserving areas. They cite a 2016 Education Trust report suggesting that subsidies might disadvantage low-income students who lack access to quality programs or required support. The National Bureau of Economic Research (2020) and the Government Accountability Office (2019) indicate that subsidies may divert resources from crucial areas like early childhood, K-12, and higher education, and may not necessarily meet the needs of workforce development or maintain quality standards.

Expense: Opposition also stems from the high costs involved in vocational education subsidies. A report from the Center for American Progress (2018) points out that such programs demand considerable investment in infrastructure, equipment, and faculty. A study by the National Conference of State Legislatures (2021) further adds that these subsidies could compete with other important educational priorities for funding.

Influx in Professions: Subsidizing vocational education could potentially lead to an overflow in specific professions, according to studies on programs in Germany and Switzerland. These subsidies appear to stimulate demand for skilled workers in the associated trades and significantly increase enrollment in vocational programs, potentially leading to market saturation.

Limitations as a Career Choice: Opponents argue that vocational education may not be a good career choice. Reports by the National Skills Coalition (2018) and the National Center for Education and the Economy (2014) suggest that many vocational programs prepare students for low-wage jobs and offer limited skill transferability, limiting career mobility and adaptability to new industries. They also report a lack of support and advancement opportunities for vocational students."

","The debate topic 'We should subsidize vocational education' presents several compelling arguments in its favor.

First, proponents claim that subsidizing vocational education promotes opportunities for individuals with fewer resources. As per a study by the National Association of State Directors of Career Technical Education Consortium (NASDCTEc), subsidies can significantly improve workforce development, especially among individuals who face barriers to employment such as limited English proficiency or disabilities. A study by the National Conference of State Legislatures underscores this by demonstrating that subsidies can increase enrollment among underrepresented groups, such as women, minorities, and veterans.

The second claim is that vocational education often better fits many students. Evidence to this effect includes the NASDCTEc's findings that vocational programs meet current workforce needs and provide training in in-demand fields, better aligning with the career goals of many students. Furthermore, the National Center for Postsecondary Research has observed that dropout rates are lower among vocational education students, suggesting that it better suits their learning styles and interests.

Third, advocates argue that vocational education is a good career choice. A study from the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce points to the higher earning potential of individuals with vocational education compared to those without postsecondary education. Moreover, the National Skills Coalition has noted that vocational education graduates often find employment faster than their four-year degree counterparts, owing to their hands-on, practical training.

Lastly, the argument is made that vocational education benefits the entire market and society. The NASDCTEc has found that vocational programs can address workforce shortages in specific industries, thus serving market and societal needs by filling in-demand jobs. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce complements this by showing that investment in vocational education boosts workforce productivity and overall economic development.

In summary, supporters argue that vocational education subsidies promote social mobility, better meet many students' needs, offer a promising career choice, and benefit the wider market and society."
