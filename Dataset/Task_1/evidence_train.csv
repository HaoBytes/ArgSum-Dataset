Among mothers who were not married when their child was born, 83 percent reported that they were romantically involved with the father, and half of the parents were living together. Nearly all of the romantically involved couples expressed interest in developing long-term stable relationships, and there was universal interest in marriage, with most indicating that there was at least a fifty-fifty chance that they would marry in the future. Looking at employment history and other factors, researchers estimated that about a third of the couples had high potential to marry; another third had some problems, like lack of a job, that could be remedied; while the final third were not good candidates due to a history of violence, incarceration, and the like (McLanahan, Garfinkel, and Mincy, 2001).",Study Evidence,We should abandon marriage,https://www.mdrc.org/publication/effects-marriage-and-divorce-families-and-children

Innate inequality was visible within these laws, best evidenced through the treatment of wives and crime. According to Lord Wilson, the law presumed that, when not evidence to the contrary, a husband forced his wife into committing a crime, and a wife could use marital coercion as a justification for committing the crime. Unsurprisingly, in deeply religious medieval society, these views were upheld, perpetuated, and perhaps sometimes created by the Bible. Indeed, in marriage ceremonies today in which the Book of Common Prayer is still commonly used, the bridegroom is asked “wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour her, keep her..?” whilst the bride is asked “wilt thou obey him, serve him, love, honour and keep him.” Even enshrined within wedding vows is a woman’s essentially contractual commitment to subservience.",Anecdotal Evidence,We should abandon marriage,https://retrospectjournal.com/2022/03/20/alls-unfair-in-marriage-and-divorce/

Whilst when a man killed his wife (uxoricide), the crime was simply murder, a woman’s killing of her husband came under the offence of petty treason until the abolition of the offence of petty treason in 1838. An attack on a husband was an attack on a lord and master and thus akin to a challenge to the authority of the crown. For crimes of treason, individuals were usually hung, drawn, and quartered, but as this was deemed to be inappropriate for women they were instead burnt at the stake. Whilst to many this may seem like a more grotesque punishment, there were some small concessions for women: for example, if she was pregnant the execution was postponed, and if she was fortunate, she might be strangled before being burnt at the stake – though that hardly seems like much of a privilege.

Many people might believe that while the death penalty isn’t ideal, it’s worth it if it dissuades potential criminals. However, polls show people don’t think capital punishment does that. The facts support that view. The American South has the highest murder rate in the country and oversees 81% of the nation’s executions. In states without the death penalty, the murder rate is much lower. There are other factors at play, but the fact remains that no studies show that capital punishment is a deterrent. If the death penalty is not only inhumane, discriminatory, and arbitrary, but it often claims innocent lives and doesn’t even prevent crime, then why should it still exist? It’s disappearing from legal systems around the world, so it’s time for all nations (like the United States) to end it.",Expert Evidence,We should abolish capital punishment,https://deathpenalty.procon.org/questions/does-the-death-penalty-deter-crime/

In 2012 the National Research Council concluded that the studies claiming it is a deterrence were fundamentally flawed. Additionally, a 2009 study of criminologists concluded that 88 percent of criminologists did not believe in the death penalties deterrence while only 5 percent did. Perhaps the most consistent and interesting data that the death penalty is not a deterrence is to look at the murder rates of states that do not have the death penalty in comparison to those that do. In states that have recently abolished the death penalty, there has been no increase in murder rates. In fact, since 1990 states without the death penalty have consistently had lower murder rates than states that have it.",Expert Evidence,We should abolish capital punishment,https://deathpenalty.procon.org/questions/does-the-death-penalty-deter-crime/

In 1978, the National Research Council, one of the most prestigious scientific institutions in the nation and world, noted that “available studies provide no useful evidence on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.” A 2012 report by the National Research Council reached a similar conclusion.

Whether one compares the similar movements of homicide in Canada and the US when only the latter restored the death penalty, or in American states that have abolished it versus those that retain it, or in Hong Kong and Singapore (the first abolishing the death penalty in the mid-1990s and the second greatly increasing its usage at the same), there is no detectable effect of capital punishment on crime. The best econometric studies reach the same conclusion… Last year roughly 14,000 murders were committed but only 35 executions took place. Since murderers typically expose themselves to far greater immediate risks, the likelihood is incredibly remote that some small chance of execution many years after committing a crime will influence the behaviour of a sociopathic deviant who would otherwise be willing to kill if his only penalty were life imprisonment. Any criminal who actually thought he would be caught would find the prospect of life without parole to be a monumental penalty.

I do not believe persons contemplating or committing murder plan to get caught or weigh the consequences.

It had purported to tell us how old the earth was (4,000 years old), how many suns there were in the universe (one), how evolution had begun (by divine decree) and why rainbows existed (to remind us of God’s promise to Noah). But these lamentable attempts were finally put to an end when science was able to investigate reality with reason, asserted itself against obscurantist priests – and drove religion into the cobwebbed attic it presently resides in.

Having argued that ought implies can establishes the reasonability of asking the rich to sacrifice their luxuries for the basic needs of the poor, Sterba invokes a second fundamental principle, The Conflict Resolution Principle, to argue that it is reasonable to make it an ethical requirement.

Of course they didn't agree to their personal ruin; they didn't agree to this restriction on their freedom. Morally they didn't have to consent; it was a remedy long overdue. Even the libertarian would agree. The slave holders' freedom was justifiably restricted by the presence of other people; the fact that there were other persons limited their acceptable alternatives. But that is exactly what the libertarian denies. Freedom, he claims, cannot be justifiably restricted without consent. In short, the difficulty in this: the libertarian talks as if there can be no legitimate non‑consensual limitations on freedom, yet his very theory involves just such limitations.
